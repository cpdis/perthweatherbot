Shadows hug the buildings and the streets, hinting at a day that will unfold slowly. The forecast suggests a warming trend, with temperatures expected to rise gently from the low 50s, but for now, the crispness of around 45 degrees invites cozy attire\u2014a comfortable sweater, perhaps, layered with a light jacket, perfect for the muted ambiance of the morning.\n\nBy midday, the clouds will part just enough to allow patches of sun to flicker through, yet signs of the bay's notorious marine layer linger around the edges, hinting at a hazy horizon and creating an ethereal quality to the landscape. This gentleness suggests a day suited for reflective activities\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through the local galleries, where the soft light bathes the art in an inviting glow, or a quiet exploration of one of the thriving caf\u00e9s where one might savor a warm drink while watching the world wake up, all around. The weather beckons a slow embrace of the city, a reminder to appreciate the nuances of this captivating landscape, wrapped in a cloak of soft clouds.",
