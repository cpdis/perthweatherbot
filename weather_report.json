    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself cloaked in a soft veil of clouds, casting a hushed serenity over the landscape. The temperature dips gently to around 45 degrees, and the light breeze drifts lazily from the west southwest. Tonight, the typical San Francisco chill nudges everyone to consider their layers\u2014a cozy scarf and a light jacket will keep spirits warm as they traverse the quiet streets.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the dawn promises a party of sunshine peeking through the lingering clouds, with daytime temperatures hovering near the cool side of winter. The winds will be gentle, caressing the day with just enough air to lift the spirits without the biting chill of harsher gusts. Such conditions invite thoughtful strolls along the Embarcadero, perhaps grabbing a warm drink from one of the local caf\u00e9s. For those who prefer to stay in, curling up with a favorite book or catching a film at one of the city\u2019s indie theaters offers both comfort and charm on a day that holds the potential for quiet reflection amidst gentle illumination.",
