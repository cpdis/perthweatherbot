    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds beneath a shroud of clouds, hinting at the rain that is likely to arrive after the clock strikes eleven. A gentle chill lingers in the air, temperatures drifting around the mid-fifties. As you gaze toward the horizon, the clarity of the day remains muted, with a soft blanket of gray above, and the distant outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge barely breaking through the mist. The hills bear witness to a dance of clouds, teasing at the possibility of an incoming marine layer that promises to cloak the city beneath a veil of fog as the daylight fades.\n\nAs the day progresses, it may be wise to don layers\u2014a warm jacket, perhaps woolen gloves, and sturdy boots will serve you well. With winds brisk from the west and the chance of rain hovering at a steady thirty to fifty percent, undertaking a late-morning stroll along the Embarcadero could connect you with the rhythm of the bay, as you breathe in the cool, salt-laden air. Later, as the clouds deepen and the likelihood of rain swells, consider retreating to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh coffee and pastries invites a moment of warmth and reflection, embracing the gentle drumming of raindrops against the window as the evening approaches.",
