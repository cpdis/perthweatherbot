    "weather_report": "The night in Downtown San Francisco settles in under a shroud of anticipation, the air brisk with a promise of rain. As you step outside, the scent of damp earth mingles with the salty whispers of the nearby bay, a prelude to the downpour forecasted before the dawn. The clouds hang heavy and thick, swirling with shades of gray, while a southwest wind carries a cool edge, nudging the last few errant leaves from their perches. With nearly perfect certainty, the rain will dance against rooftops and sidewalks throughout the night, offering a soothing symphony to those within.\n\nAs Tuesday breaks, a gradual shift will bring glimpses of clearer skies, perhaps a tentative patch of sunlight piercing the gloom before retreating once more. The high will flirt with 58 degrees, settling back to a cooler embrace by afternoon. For those braving the elements, a warm sweater beneath a waterproof jacket may be the wisest choice, paired with boots that embrace the puddles rather than shun them. A walk through the subdued streets could reveal a city alive with the sound of raindrops kissing the pavement, beckoning discovery of hidden cafes or perhaps a quiet corner to savor a warm drink. As the temperatures dip slightly and the rain gently ebbs, a fleeting chance to feel the sun's warmth might offer hope in the enveloping gray\u2014a fleeting moment to breathe in the fresh promise of a new day.",
