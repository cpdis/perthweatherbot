    "weather_report": "As night wraps Downtown San Francisco in its quiet embrace, the air feels still and crisp, with the temperature dipping to a refreshing 46 degrees. Partly cloudy skies usher in a gentle northwest wind, brushing through the streets at a mild pace, lending an almost ethereal quality to the evening. Peering into the horizon, the city\u2019s lights twinkle like constellations scattered beneath a blanket of soft cloud cover. There\u2019s no hint of fog suffocating the view tonight; rather, a mellow clarity settles over the landscape, revealing the city's skyline with a serene intimacy.\n\nAs we transition into Tuesday, the dawn will greet us with mostly sunny skies, though the warmth will gradually shift as the afternoon beckons, cooling to around 56 degrees. For those venturing out, comfort is key; a light jacket or sweater would be wise as the breeze may carry a chill. The day holds a perfect invitation to enjoy quiet strolls along the waterfront, where the sun dances on the bay\u2019s surface, or perhaps to explore the nooks of a local caf\u00e9, savoring the warmth of a fresh brew while the city comes alive around you. Seek out moments that unfold with ease; this weather whispers of calm opportunities to connect with the heart of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant life.",
