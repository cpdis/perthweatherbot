    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a clean, open sky tonight, the kind that makes the streetlights look gentler and the edges of the trees a little sharper. It\u2019s clear now and set to stay that way through midnight and into the small hours; there\u2019s no sun to speak of, of course, and the UV index is effectively zero. The night feels calm rather than harsh, a good backdrop for quiet errands and unhurried thoughts.\n\nIf these cloudless conditions linger into morning, expect a bright, unfiltered sun and a UV index that climbs quickly after breakfast, so plan shade, a hat, and sunscreen for any time outdoors. For the moment, a light layer will do if you\u2019re stepping out; comfortable shoes for a short wander around the block, perhaps bringing in the last of the washing or watering the pots before bed. If you\u2019re awake a bit later, a cup of tea on the verandah and a look at the sky would fit the mood, with tomorrow\u2019s bag laid out for an early start before the glare returns.",
