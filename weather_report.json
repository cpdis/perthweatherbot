Highs are anticipated to hover around the mid-fifties, slowly transitioning into a cooler embrace of the afternoon. A gentle northeast breeze stirs, echoing the whispers of the bay\u2014perfect for those taking a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps enjoying a quiet morning coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \n\nWhile the sunlight may flirt with clarity, shadows of the marine layer linger in the distance, subtly reminding us of the city's notorious fog. By evening, the sky will wrap itself in soft clouds, ushering in temperatures that fall into the forties. It\u2019s a day that invites layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a sweater, finished with a scarf for that early chill. As the afternoon unfolds, one might find solace in a local bookstore, or take the opportunity to explore the quieter corners of the city, where the bustle is just a distant hum. The fading light holds an unhurried promise, perfect for savoring moments of stillness before the night settles in.",
