    "weather_report": "As the first light of dawn stretches through Subiaco, the sky dons a soft veil of scattered clouds, reminiscent of strokes from an eager artist's brush. It's a morning that whispers promise and invites serenity with every gentle breeze. The day ahead suggests a dance between sunlight and shadows, with clouds meandering, hinting at intervals of warm sunshine. The UV index should be moderate, whispering a gentle warning to protect yourself with a wide-brimmed hat and perhaps a dab of sunscreen. Today unfolds with an air of subtle elegance, perfect for leisurely strolls or immersing oneself in a beloved novel on a sun-dappled terrace. Given this tranquil tapestry, a light jacket might accompany you as you wander, adapting to the briskness in the fleeting shade while being prepared for the embrace of the sun when it smiles through. It's a day for contemplative walks, where you might find yourself swaying to the rhythm of your thoughts, or perhaps enjoying the simple pleasures of a coffee savored slowly amid the ambient hum of a nearby cafe, surrounded by murmuring trees and the world carrying on softly around you.",
