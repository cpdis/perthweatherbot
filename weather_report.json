    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the night is quiet and a little heavy, the air gathering that faint metallic scent that precedes rain. Streetlights throw soft halos on the pavement while cloud slides in, and the scene feels hushed, almost private. Sunshine is off the stage for now; clarity is muted by low cloud and a damp sheen that will likely arrive toward the small hours.\n\nLight rain looks set to brush through before dawn and linger into the early commute, so expect a grey, soft-focus morning with only brief, grudging hints of brightness at best. UV is negligible until after sunrise; if the cloud sticks around, it will stay low, but should the sky crack open later, it can climb quickly, as it does here even in early spring. Dress for an easy truce with the weather: a light waterproof layer, something with a hood, shoes that don\u2019t mind wet pavements, and a small umbrella tucked into a bag. Good plans are simple ones\u2014an early tram or train instead of the walk, a first coffee under an awning, a tidy-up at home while the showers pass. If the ceiling lifts midmorning, a short stroll to the markets or a quick errand between bursts of drizzle will feel oddly satisfying.",
