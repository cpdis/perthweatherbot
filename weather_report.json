A gentle north-northeast breeze flutters through the streets, carrying hints of autumn's chill. The skies above remain mostly clear, offering a stark contrast to the typical fog that often blankets this coastal locale. It\u2019s a refreshing sight for those who prefer the city\u2019s nightlife illuminated against a backdrop of unclouded skies. \n\nTomorrow, Thanksgiving Day promises a sunny reprieve, with a high near 58. The afternoon will usher in a gradual cooling, as temperatures dance down to the mid-50s, beckoning one to perhaps layer up for evening festivities. As you step out into this inviting fall day, consider dressing in light layers\u2014a cozy sweater over a shirt could strike the perfect balance against the briskness of the wind. It's an ideal backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, enjoying the twinkling lights reflecting off the bay, or perhaps a quiet afternoon among the vibrant fall foliage in Golden Gate Park, where the beauty of the season is captured in each rustling leaf.",
