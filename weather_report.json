The current temperature hovers around a brisk 45 degrees, hinting at the need for an extra layer against the cool northwest breeze that stirs gently at around four miles per hour. Tonight, the city breathes a reprieve from the bustle, with just enough clarity to admire the silhouettes of familiar landmarks against the dimming horizon. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, an embrace of mostly sunny weather beckons, with highs peaking near 54 before gracefully easing into the cool embrace of afternoon. As the day unfolds, expect a subtle drop in temperature, accompanied by gentle northeast winds whispering promises of a refreshing day ahead. The absence of fog or the heavy marine layer lends delightful clarity, inviting you to consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet spot in one of the local parks, where the sun can warm your face while the city breathes vividly around you. Dress in layers\u2014a light sweater and a windbreaker would make for comfortable companions during the day\u2019s ebb and flow. Whether you find solace in a caf\u00e9 with a book or wander through your neighborhood, this is a fine day to be in the city, absorbing the rhythm of life in tranquil elegance.",
