The forecast keeps it cloudless through late evening and after midnight, so there\u2019s no sun to contend with and the UV is essentially asleep; visibility is excellent and the mood is quietly cheerful rather than cold. A light layer does the trick\u2014a soft jumper or thin jacket if you\u2019re lingering\u2014and shoes you don\u2019t mind ambling in. It\u2019s a good hour to air the house for a few minutes, water the balcony pots, take a slow walk to the corner shop, or sit outside and let the day empty itself out. If these clear skies hold toward dawn, expect a bright start and a quick return of UV once the sun is up, so set out sunglasses and sunscreen with tomorrow\u2019s bag and enjoy the gentleness while it lasts.",
