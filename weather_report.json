    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes beneath a quiet, cloudless sky, the streets still cool and bluish before dawn. Expect a clean, uncomplicated day once the sun lifts: bright, unfiltered light, the kind that sharpens edges and puts a shine on verandas and jacaranda leaves. UV will start gentle but rise to a distinctly sun-smart level by late morning, so plan on sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat if you\u2019ll linger outdoors. The air should feel clear and dry, with views crisp and colors honest. It looks like one of those days that begins in a jumper and ends in shirtsleeves.\n\nFor now, a soft start suits: a stroll for coffee, a quiet jog along tree-lined streets, or watering the garden before the heat of the light sets in. Later, open the windows, hang washing to take advantage of the quick dry, or cycle to a park bench with a book. Keep shade in mind through midday and enjoy the simple pleasure of a well-lit day.",
