    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes before the sun, the streets tinted a quiet blue and the sky mostly clear, promising a clean, glassy light as dawn tips in. The first hours look bright and gentle, with only a few scattered clouds wandering in by midmorning to soften the edges. Visibility should be crisp, the sort of morning where outlines feel newly etched. As the light strengthens, the UV will climb quickly; by late morning it\u2019s likely to be assertive, the kind that asks for sunscreen, a brim, and dark lenses.\n\nIt feels like a day for light layers: something easy over the shoulders at first, pared back to short sleeves once the sun finds its stride. An unhurried walk to fetch bread or a coffee suits this hour, or a quiet loop on the bike before the day gathers heat and glare. Open the windows, let the cool air rinse the rooms, hang a wash while the sky is honest. If you\u2019ll be out through lunch, plan your route with shade in mind, and let the afternoon be patient work indoors, saving the next errand for the gentle light returning toward evening.",
