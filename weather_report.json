    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil afternoon unfolds beneath a canvas brushed with sunlight, inviting the city to bask in mild radiance. Currently, temperatures flirt gently around 62 degrees, gradually shifting cooler as the afternoon draws on, whispering promises of a crisp evening ahead. The breeze\u2014soft, around 7 miles per hour from the west\u2014carries the freshness of the bay, offering a reassuring caress against the skin. The skies, expansive and clear, reveal no signs of fog, setting the stage for a delightful evening as darkness approaches.\n\nAs night falls, expect the mercury to descend to a cozy 49 degrees, making it ideal for a light jacket, perhaps even a knitted scarf, to savor those evening strolls through neighborhoods alive with the sounds and lights of the city. The absence of fog tonight will make for a particularly delightful backdrop for an evening out, perfect for indulgent conversations over coffee or a quiet promenade along the Embarcadero, as well as the simple joy of people-watching under the star-sprinkled sky. Embrace the moment, for such a spectacle in December is a true gift San Francisco offers its residents.",
