    "weather_report": "Suspended in the azure palm of the heavens, the sun paints a crystal-clear portrait of Cottesloe. A soft symphony of sunlight dances upon the wide expanse of the earth, as the day commenced in an uninterrupted fashion with a clear sky. However, as time has trodden on, whispers of clouds have begun to stitch their modest tapestry across the skyline, adding to what could be nothing but a pleasant sight, with clear visibility all throughout. There is a silent sizzle to the air which subtly hints at the calm yet strong UV index for the day. Every breath is made into poetry under such a perfect sky, with light wearing the cloak of the sun.\n\nGiven such conditions, donning a brimmed hat, perhaps a pair of sunglasses to shield from the UV rays and a light garment to celebrate the sun's brilliance would be a sensible choice. Today is just the impeccable day to embrace the serenity pulses through every bit of Cottesloe, where a walk through the quiet lanes studded with house gardens or a reading session in a sunlit corner of the town library would be nothing short of a joyous indulgence. As the day progresses, the transition from an absolute clear sky to a few clouds is expected make the evening even more delightful, paving the way to appreciate the sun's elegance in all its glory.",
