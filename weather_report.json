    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the city basks under a cloak of clarity. The air is brisk, with a low hovering around 56 degrees, carried by a north wind that whispers through the streets, occasionally gusting with a spirited shake of 43 mph. For now, the sky is mostly clear, allowing the twinkling lights of the city to dance against the dark canvas of the evening. Though the horizon remains free of fog, the promise of a sunny Wednesday looms, hinting at a high of 69 degrees. As the day unfolds, expect a gentle descent in temperature toward the afternoon, settling around 64 as the wind continues to play its tune.\n\nThis mild, breezy night invites a cozy layer\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the chill. A stroll along the Embarcadero could be a delightful way to engage with the evening, the sights of the Bay sparkling in the distance, beckoning quiet conversations. As one prepares for the day ahead, a comfortable ensemble will do well for the predicted warmth of blue skies and a lively breeze, perfect for lunch at a sunlit caf\u00e9. Just be mindful of the gusts that could playfully tangle in one\u2019s hair or rustle the pages of a book brought along for the journey.",
