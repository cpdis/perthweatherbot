    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds blankets the city, hinting at the moisture settling in for a chilly day. The air feels moist and carries a muted promise of rain, with temperatures hovering around a cool 51 degrees, destined to reach a modest high of 59. The southeast wind whispers through the streets, occasionally picking up strength, rustling the trees and weaving through the alleys. A chance of rain looms, thick with anticipation, as the day unravels its cloudy tapestry, casting a grey hue over the iconic vistas.\n\nWhile the crisp air invites a brisk morning walk, it also beckons you to wear layers; a light jacket or sweater will serve you well against the biting breeze. A stroll towards the waterfront could prove rewarding, the sound of the waves complementing the rhythmic pulse of the city, as cafes brew warmth and comfort for those seeking refuge from the impending drizzle. Whether it\u2019s a visit to a quiet bookstore to lose yourself in pages or a leisurely exploration of the local artisan stalls, today offers a canvas for understated pleasures amidst the encroaching clouds.",
