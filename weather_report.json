    "weather_report": "Denmark wakes under a sky that has been loosening its grip since morning: broken cloud at breakfast giving way to scattered, gentler patches by late morning. Now, early afternoon, the light moves in and out like a tide, brief sunbeams skating across streets and water before the next tuft of cloud slips by. It feels clean and crisp, the kind of clarity that sharpens edges without turning harsh. The October sun is present but polite; UV is low, perhaps a touch livelier around midday, more a nudge than a burn.\n\nThe rest of the day looks mostly dry with on-and-off brightness and a cool hush in the air. Think layers: a light jacket, long sleeves, comfortable shoes, perhaps a scarf if you linger in the shade. Sunglasses won\u2019t be wasted during those sunnier intervals; sunscreen is optional unless you\u2019re outside for hours. It\u2019s good weather for small errands on foot, a slow bike to the bakery, a quiet bench in a park with a book, or tending to the balcony plants between sunbreaks. If you prefer indoors, a window table suits the passing light, letting you watch the clouds unspool while the afternoon ambles toward evening.",
