    "weather_report": "As the evening gently descends upon Subiaco, the pitter-patter of light rain lingers in the air, casting a soft, misty veil over the town's rustic charm. The earlier showers have given way to a mellow, damp embrace, leaving behind a refreshing balm in the breeze. Though the day has bid adieu to the sun with a cloudy farewell, promising no bright spectacle, the atmosphere offers a tranquil, albeit gray, serenity. The sky dons a subdued palette, with no vivid splashes of pinks or oranges; instead, it carries the understated elegance of twilight silver, ideal for quiet reflection.\n\nGiven the damp conditions, a comfortable, water-resistant jacket will be your best companion, along with sturdy shoes to navigate the lingering puddles. As the rain's rhythm accompanies the gentle hues of dusk, one might consider savoring an evening indoors, perhaps indulging in the aroma of freshly brewed coffee or tea, while leafing through a novel that has patiently awaited your attention. The day invites you to weave warmth into your plans, finding solace in both the tangible comforts of home and the enriching world found within pages. It's a time to relish the peace that comes with retreating from the outside bluster, embracing the restful cadence of a rainy evening.",
