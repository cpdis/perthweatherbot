    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfurls gently beneath a blue sky, the kind that invites possibility and brightens the spirit. As the afternoon sun climbs higher, it casts warm rays on the city, nudging temperatures toward a comfortable 63, before they dip again to about 59 later in the day. A light northwest breeze brushes past, infusing the air with a crispness characteristic of this vibrant coastal enclave. The clarity is striking, with nary a fog bank in sight, a pleasant departure from the usual mist that can envelop the bridges and hills.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will remain mostly clear with a low around 49, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. For today's activities, a light jacket will stave off the chill while still allowing ample mobility, perhaps perfect for a quiet exploration of the lesser-trodden paths of Golden Gate Park or a cozy cafe visit to savor a warm drink. With the charm of a sunny San Francisco day beckoning, you might find inspiration in the art-filled alleyways of the Mission or take a serene walk along the Embarcadero, soaking in the beauty that this city has to offer.",
