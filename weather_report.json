    "weather_report": "Shenton Park moves through midday under a broad, honest blue. The sun is unblinking and the air clear, with only a thin drift of cloud expected early afternoon before the sky opens fully toward evening. It will be decidedly sunny; UV is intense around now and stays high through midafternoon, easing as shadows lengthen and the light turns honeyed. The day feels simple and bright, the kind that sharpens edges and invites a slower pace.\n\nWear breathable layers with a brimmed hat and dark glasses, and don sunscreen as a matter of routine; keep a light extra layer for dusk when the warmth lets go. Good hours for a gentle errand on foot, a quiet lap around Shenton Park Lake, or a coffee taken in the shade while the afternoon mellows; save any gardening or longer walk for the later glow, when the sun loosens its grip and the sky remains clear.",
