    "weather_report": "As night descends on Downtown San Francisco, a gentle coolness envelops the city, the air tinged with the embrace of moisture and hints of impending fog. With a low inching toward 47 degrees, the north-northeast winds whisper softly at about 6 mph, offering a refreshing respite from the day's warmth. The clouds are reclaiming their space between the stars, casting a subtle veil over the skyline, promising a tranquil yet slightly hushed evening.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the dawn will likely greet us with patchy fog low in the morning, momentarily shrouding our views before giving way to uneven patches of blue amidst cottony clouds. Highs will tease the outer limits of urban comfort, reaching near 58 before sliding back into the 50s as the afternoon draws on. With the north wind edging up to 7 mph, a light sweater or jacket will serve well for those on their morning stroll, while the day\u2019s gradual warming allows for a leisurely outing sans layers in the mid-afternoon sun. The lingering fog may later subside, leaving behind a tranquil day for indulging in a peaceful walk along those hidden lanes, perhaps stopping for a quiet coffee or immersing oneself in a local gallery, savoring every moment of this San Francisco charm.",
