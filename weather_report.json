    "weather_report": "Early afternoon in Mascot feels warm and a touch humid, the light a pale silver where clouds soften the sun. Expect the day to grow increasingly overcast, with light showers slipping in from late afternoon and lingering into the evening, more a polite interruption than a storm. Sunshine will be fleeting rather than bold, yet the UV remains high for this time of year, so a hat and sunscreen still earn their keep between the brighter gaps. The air stays fairly clear, though the sky will take on that chalky, muted look that makes colors on the street feel subdued.\n\nDress for easy movement: a breathable shirt, light trousers or a skirt, and keep a compact umbrella or thin rain shell handy for the trip home. It\u2019s a good day to run errands or take a short stroll now, then retreat to something unhurried later: a quiet coffee near a window, an early shop for dinner ingredients, or tidying the desk before the first drops tap the panes.",
