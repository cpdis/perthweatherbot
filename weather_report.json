    "weather_report": "Perth wakes to a clear, lucid morning with only a few clouds idling at the edges, the kind that soften the light without stealing it. The sun already has that springtime bite, sharpening colors and warming pavements; UV will climb quickly and lean strong to very strong around the middle of the day, so shade and sunscreen are part of the uniform. The air feels dry and clean, visibility wide open, and there\u2019s no real hint of rain in the script.\n\nExpect a bright, mostly sunny day to hold through the afternoon with just passing flecks of cloud, the kind of weather that invites a light shirt, easy layers, a brimmed hat, and dark lenses. It\u2019s a pleasant one for small errands on foot, a mid-morning coffee outside, or hanging a wash that will dry before lunch. Take lunch under a tree or on a shaded balcony; save the longer walk, river cycle, or a bit of garden tinkering for later, when the light softens and the heat eases back.",
