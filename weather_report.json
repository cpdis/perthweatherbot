    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crispness, blending with the veils of cloud that gather overhead. The temperature softly nestles around 48 degrees, while a gentle wind whispers from the west northwest, stirring the city\u2019s iconic fog. It\u2019s an evening painted in shades of gray, with a muted ambiance that invites cozy introspection, perfect for curling up with a book or exploring the local eateries that warm both body and spirit.\n\nLooking ahead to Washington's Birthday, the anticipated day holds a promise of fleeting sunlight\u2014a welcome interlude in the otherwise cloudy canvas. The temperature is expected to climb toward a cool 57, eventually dipping down slightly in the afternoon. The marine layer, characteristic of the Bay Area, may linger, particularly closer to the coast, casting an enchanting aura over the landscape. It might be wise to dress in layers, perhaps a light jacket to fend off the chill, while also preparing for moments of brightness. With this blend of partly sunny conditions, it becomes an opportune day for a leisurely stroll among the avenues or a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9 where conversations mingle like the soft notes of an evening tune.",
