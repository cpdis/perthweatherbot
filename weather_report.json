    "weather_report": "As the day wanes in Downtown San Francisco, the air carries the promise of an approaching rain, with the sky cloaked in a deepening layer of clouds. The afternoon is dipped in a muted light, and temperatures hover just above fifty-five degrees, hinting at the chill that will deepen as night falls. The southward wind whispers softly, while the higher altitudes are painted with shadows of fog creeping in, softening the outlines of the city's iconic structures. The Golden Gate Bridge and the skyline are shyly veiled, as if wrapped in a grey blanket.\n\nAs darkness approaches, the forecast warns of likely rain after nine, bringing with it the scent of damp earth and the rhythmic sound of droplets on rooftops. For those journeying outdoors, a light jacket or sweater is prudent, layered over soft knits to ward off the evening's chill. The allure of this weather beckons quieter pleasures; perhaps a meditative stroll through the Presidio under an umbrella, or an intimate gathering in a cozy caf\u00e9 where the warmth of conversation contrasts with the chill just beyond the window. As the lights of the city flicker into life, the scene promises a crisp, reflective evening cocooned in the embrace of San Francisco's iconic fog.",
