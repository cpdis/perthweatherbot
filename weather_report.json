    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco arrives with a clean, polished sky and sunlight that sharpens edges on verandas and jacaranda shade. Forecasts keep the canvas simple: clear through late morning and early afternoon, a steady, glassy blue with little to interrupt it. Expect the sun to grow forthright toward midday; UV will climb quickly, so it\u2019s a day for shade when you can find it and protection when you can\u2019t.\n\nIt looks pleasantly uncomplicated, the kind of dry brightness that invites gentle errands and small pleasures. Dress light and breathable, a brimmed hat and sunglasses at the ready, sunscreen on the shoulders, water within reach. This morning suits a stroll to the shops, a coffee under an awning, or hanging the washing so it dries in no time. By early afternoon, duck into a gallery or a quiet bookshop if the glare starts to press; later, a slow walk home under the lengthening shadows will feel just right.",
