    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a quilt of cloud, the light soft and silvery, the air holding that gentle hush before rain. Late morning looks set to bring a brief, polite shower, enough to bead the pavements and freshen the jasmine, then the sky should loosen into broken cloud through the early afternoon with occasional shards of blue. It won\u2019t be a blazing day; the sun will feel filtered and mild, though spring UV still finds its way through when the cloud thins, running from modest this morning to noticeably punchier around midday. The view will be clear with a touch of softness at the edges, colors slightly desaturated by the cloud and rain-washed air.\n\nDress in light layers with a compact rain jacket, comfortable closed shoes, and consider a hat or a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019re out around lunch. This is good weather for a window seat and a slow coffee, a browse through the library or a record shop, a tidy of the pantry, or a short stroll when the breaks appear, letting the streets steam gently and the magpies narrate the afternoon.",
