    "weather_report": "As the late afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds cloaks the skyline, softening the edges of the iconic architecture and casting a muted light across the streets. Rain drizzles gently, a reminder that the city is in the grasp of an autumn chill as the temperature hovers near 56 degrees, gradually edging downward. The wind, a lively companion, sweeps through at 10 to 18 mph, rustling the trees and whispering through alleyways with gusts that flirt with 31 mph. The chance of rain lingers at 60%, hinting at the promise of more dampness before the night draws in.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the rain to persist, potentially retreating around 10 PM. The skies should clear slightly, revealing a moody yet striking palette as darkness envelops the city. The cool breeze invites a cozy sweater or a light jacket, perhaps even a waterproof layer to brace against the persistent drizzle. Consider enjoying a quiet stroll through the nearby neighborhoods, where the scent of wet earth mingles with the urban notes of wood and concrete, or perhaps find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, watching the world unfold from a window where raindrops race against the glass. Today may lack the sun's sparkle, but it offers a certain charm\u2014a reminder of nature's rhythms woven into the fabric of city life.",
