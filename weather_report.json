    "weather_report": "A cloak of clouds envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air heavy with the promise of rain, which begins to fall with a steady insistence. As dawn breaks, the city stirs beneath a shroud of gray, dimly lit by the resilience of morning lights pushing through the mist. The temperature lingers around a mild 57 degrees, but the dampness in the air makes it feel cooler, evoking a sense of somber intimacy. Winds from the south-southeast whip through the streets, carrying with them whispers of maritime chill that tease at the collar of your coat.\n\nThroughout the day, rain will continue to ballet through the air, each drop a reminder of the season's embrace. As temperatures shift to hover near 62, the clouds will conspire to keep the sun hidden, a reluctant guest in a gathering of stormy guests. If errands must be run or a stroll is to be attempted, remember to don layers\u2014an umbrella feels necessary, and boots will serve to keep feet dry amidst puddles that collect on the sidewalk. Indoor pursuits might be more appealing today: consider cozying up in a caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup of coffee, allowing the world outside to melt away in the background symphony of rain and wind. A chance to stay warm and dry while the city embraces its elemental dance.",
