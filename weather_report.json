    "weather_report": "As the twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the city envelops itself in a foggy embrace, the veils of mist beginning to roll in from the bay. Currently, there's a tranquil ambience touched by a gentle breeze, hinting at the atmospheric shifts that call for a cozy evening indoors. Expect patchy fog to accompany the night, softening the outlines of familiar landmarks and bestowing them with an ethereal quality. The temperatures are expected to dip to around 47 degrees, just chilly enough to warrant a light jacket or a warm sweater, comforting against the encroaching coolness.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the fog will linger before giving way to the sun's gentle rays, promising a mostly sunny disposition. However, the charm of the day lies in an easy transition, as the morning mist clears to reveal a day that balances warmth with a refreshing coolness, reaching highs near 58 degrees. With a light wind from the north-northwest, it's an ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the city\u2019s streets or perhaps to explore the quiet corners of Golden Gate Park, enjoying the lingering freshness that follows the fog. As the afternoon arrives with slightly cooler tones, a warm scarf might pair nicely with your layers, perfecting the ensemble for a day steeped in San Francisco's unique character.",
