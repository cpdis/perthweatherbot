    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in the hush before dawn, the air cool and clean, the sky mostly clear with the first inkling of light gathering in the east. Expect a bright start once the sun lifts, with a few scattered clouds wandering in by mid-morning to soften the glare without stealing the day. Sunshine will be the main character, and while the UV is negligible now, it will rise quickly after breakfast and become frankly assertive by late morning; hats, sunglasses, and a dab of sunscreen will serve you well. Clarity looks good overall, the kind of morning where rooftops and gum leaves etch sharply against a rinsed-blue sky.\n\nIt should feel like a pleasant day in the making: cool at first, calling for a light layer or a soft jumper you can shrug off as the warmth arrives. Consider an early walk to the corner caf\u00e9, a quiet stretch in the park, or a short bike ride before the UV sharpens; save pottering with indoor tasks or a shaded bit of garden work for later. Windows open, a gentle airing of the house, and the day may carry you along without fuss.",
