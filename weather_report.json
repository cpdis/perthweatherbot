    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco is draped in the cool embrace of a mostly clear night, an inviting lull promising a serene day ahead. As the morning breaks, the sunlight will weave through the remnants of darkness, warming the city to a modest high, where brisk winds from the southeast mingle gently with the crisp air, offering a refreshing moment of clarity. The anticipated drop in afternoon temperatures echoes the gradual transition from warmth to the slightly chillier embrace of evening, casting a subtle reminder of the coastal influence that lingers ever-present.\n\nToday\u2019s outlook is pleasantly bright, shying away from the fog that often shrouds the iconic skyline. While the golden hues of the sunrise hint at the beauty yet to unfold, a light jacket paired with breathable layers would serve well, ideal for those meandering through city streets or basking in the sun's embrace at a caf\u00e9 terrace. Strolling along the Embarcadero could be a delightful way to enjoy the day, perhaps stopping for a moment of reflection by the bay, where the tranquil waters converse softly with the winds. It is an ideal time for simple pleasures, whether indulging in a warm pastry from a local bakery or exploring hidden corners of the city. Today's charm lies within the mundane, inviting you to savor the soft rhythm of life that thrives in this vibrant coastal haven.",
