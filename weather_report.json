    "weather_report": "As the sun begins its graceful descent over Downtown San Francisco, the day transforms into a canvas of soft hues bathed in clarity. The skyline stands proud, unshrouded by fog, revealing sharp outlines against a brilliant blue sky. The temperature dips gently from a peak of fifty-four degrees, inviting a sense of coolness that mingles refreshingly with a faint northwesterly breeze. Tonight, however, whispers of moisture drift in, promising a chance of rain as the hour nears four, bringing a gentle shift to the evening.\n\nWith the air carrying a hint of crispness, those venturing out might opt for a light jacket or a cozy sweater, ideal for enjoying a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. As the skies begin to steal the radiance of the day, it\u2019s a perfect time to visit one of the quiet coffee spots that dot the corners of the neighborhood, perhaps nestled near the Ferry Building, where the rich aroma of newly brewed espresso complements the soft rustle of evening. Take a moment to appreciate the vibrancy of the city as it transitions from day to night, capturing the charm that is uniquely San Francisco.",
