    "weather_report": "This morning in Downtown San Francisco, the air is cool and crisp, inviting a gentle breeze from the east-northeast that barely rustles the leaves. The sun attempts to break through, offering a glimpse of warmth with its slanted golden light, though the city is draped in a thin veil of clouds. While it\u2019s not entirely foggy, a light marine layer can be sensed lingering near the horizon, a reminder of the bay\u2019s proximity. As the day unfolds, temperatures will hover around a modest fifty-six, subtly drifting towards fifty-four as the afternoon progresses. \n\nWith a hint of rain on the horizon, particularly after four in the morning, it's wise to dress in layers\u2014a light jacket over a sweater will suffice, allowing for comfort should the clouds roll in later. As evening approaches, the prospect of a soft drizzle invites reflection and relaxation. Perhaps one might take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or seek refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, the scent of freshly brewed coffee resonating with the comfortable ambiance. Embrace the day\u2019s modest charm; it is perfect for quiet pursuits or indulging in simple pleasures.",
