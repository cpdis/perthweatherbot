    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon ushers in a gentle embrace of mostly sunny skies, where the high creeps toward a cool 59 degrees, dipping slightly as the day wanes. A light north-northeast breeze weaves through the city, whispering of the approaching twilight. Despite the brighter moments of the day, a thin veil of cloudiness begins to blanket the horizon, hinting at the evening's promise of a cooler, more subdued ambiance, settling into the low 40s. The marine layer lurks quietly, just beyond the Golden Gate, leaving an ethereal haze along the water\u2019s edge but refraining from casting a heavy fog across the urban core.\n\nDressing in layers is prudent; a light sweater or jacket will provide comfort against the refreshing breeze and evening chill. Seek out a cozy caf\u00e9 for an afternoon respite or take a leisurely stroll along the shoreline to appreciate the soft play of light on the bay, where the horizon blurs into a canvas of muted blues and whites. Engaging with the scenery of this iconic city is always a worthwhile endeavor, as the day cools gracefully into night, inviting a moment of reflection amid the bustle.",
