    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, cool hush, the sky a deep pre-dawn blue softening at the edges. Air feels clean on the skin, and the few streetlights still burning look almost theatrical against the calm. With no cloud to speak of, the morning will break quickly and decisively into sunshine, the kind that sharpens edges and brings out the scent of stone and gum leaves.\n\nExpect a bright, lucid day with excellent visibility and a UV index that will climb fast once the sun gets a little height; by late morning it will be strong enough to warrant a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Light layers suit the hour\u2014something you can peel back as the warmth builds. This is good weather for ordinary pleasures: a gentle walk to pick up bread while the shade is long, hanging a wash early so it dries in honest light, watering the balcony herbs before the glare sets in. If you\u2019re commuting, a bike ride or an unhurried stroll will feel agreeable in the fresh hours, and later you might retreat to a patch of dappled shade with a book or a list of small errands. Keep water handy, and let the sun do the bright work while you take it at a human pace.",
