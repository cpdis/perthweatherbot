    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls its gray tendrils over Downtown San Francisco, a shroud of clouds lingers, promising a day where sunlight will only occasionally pierce through. The air is cool, sitting just above 43 degrees, with a gentle east wind carrying the scent of impending rain. A light patter of droplets is expected to begin making their serenade before morning gives way to the busyness of Wednesday, as the skies continue their muted display, obscured by the fog that blankets the city like a delicate silk coverlet.\n\nWhile rain is sure to grace our streets by late afternoon, early hours are marked by a melancholy sort of beauty, one that may tempt a stroll beneath an umbrella or a quiet morning spent in a cozy caf\u00e9. Those venturing outside should dress in layers, perhaps with a light jacket to ward off the chill, while sturdy shoes may be wise as the ground becomes slick. The promise of rain beckons one to embrace indoor activities later\u2014think of a leisurely visit to a museum or an afternoon spent browsing the aisles of an independent bookstore, where the scents of aged paper and fresh coffee intermingle. Such pursuits might offer warmth against the damp chill outside, as the clouds prepare to release their burden onto the city below.",
