    "weather_report": "The nighttime canopy in Subiaco is woven with threads of misty light rain, lending a softness to the otherwise inky black canvas of the sky. The gloaming hours have surrendered to the enchanting melody of rainfall persisting past midnight, transforming the world into a silvery watercolor painting. Preludes of warmth are in the air, yet comfort may be found swathed in the comforting embrace of a rain-soaked coat, quietly dulling the cold. \n\nAs the new day dawns, the sun takes its time to peek through the gray palette of the morning. The light rain, polite and unobtrusive, continues its hypnotic serenade, setting a soothing symphony for the morning rush. In reverence to the overcast, the day promises not too much clarity but also a respite from glaring UV rays. Find the pleasantness in this day tucked away in a coffee shop, nestled between sips of warm beverages paired with the staccato sounds of raindrops against the window. Today's dress code reads thick woolly sweaters and gumboots, rain-slicked pavements and umbrellas blooming like flowers in the drizzle. Delight in a good book or thoughtful conversation, as Subiaco sings the melancholic and beautiful poetry of a typical rainy day - and don't forget your umbrella.\n\nHTML color code:  (Light Slate Gray).",
