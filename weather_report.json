    "weather_report": "As the new day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle quietly introduces a hint of moisture to the air, a soft prelude to the rain anticipated throughout the hours ahead. The sky, cloaked in a thick blanket of cloud cover, offers a muted pastel reverse of the usually vibrant cityscape. The chill in the air, lingering around 53 degrees, prompts one to reach for layers: a cozy sweater or perhaps a light rain jacket would serve well, especially as the temperatures will dip slightly into the afternoon.\n\nWith the forecast promising a steady rain\u2014a 90% chance, no less\u2014there\u2019s a certain melancholy beauty to the impending downpour. It encourages the kind of introspective moments that can be spent within the city's eclectic cafes, where the steam from a warm cup of coffee fogs the cool glass windows, creating an intimate refuge from the damp outside. The streets may be quieter today, but that only adds to the atmosphere of contemplation, perfect for wandering art galleries or indulging in the cozy embrace of a bookstore. The marine layer may wrap the Golden Gate Bridge in its misty allure, obscuring its grandeur momentarily, as if the city is holding its breath for the rain to come and wash it anew.",
