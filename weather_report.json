    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night drapes a curtain of rain, soft and persistent, bidding the city to draw close under layers of warmth. The winds whisper through the streets, carrying the scent of moistened earth and the promise of more deluge to come. Clouds blanket the sky, cloaking the Golden Gate Bridge and hills beyond in a shroud of gray, with a chill that seeps through even the coziest of sweaters. As dawn approaches, the murmur of raindrops forms a tranquil symphony, vibrating off the pavement and mingling with the bustling energy of the waking city.\n\nBy midday, the weather offers little respite, as the rains transition into hearty showers, punctuated by the occasional rumble of distant thunder. Visibility will be muted, as the marine layer stretches across the bay, obscuring the familiar vistas that might otherwise invite a stroll. Layering becomes essential; a waterproof jacket paired with sturdy shoes could transform a damp outing into an adventure rather than a chore. For those seeking refuge from the elements, perhaps a leisurely afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, where rain-soaked views become a tapestry of nature's rhythm, would be the perfect escape. In such moments, one discovers not merely the weather outside, but a cozy capital for quiet reflection held within the city's embrace.",
