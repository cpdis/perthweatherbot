    "weather_report": "As the sun edges toward its descent, downtown San Francisco basks in a modest glow, the afternoon presenting a canvas of partly sunny skies with temperatures that flirt with the briskness of the season. The high of approximately 54 feels invigorating, but soon a gentle coolness drapes the city as temperatures dip to around 52. A slight west wind rustles the leaves, its breath barely stirring amidst the urban hum of the city. Yet, as shadows lengthen, the skyline reveals a subtle shift; a veil of clouds begins to weave through the vistas, hinting at the promise of a cool, cloudy night ahead, the temperature settling to around 46.\n\nThe day has unfurled a muted palette, where the shimmering bay and the silhouettes of distant hills meet a sky that hints at the encroaching marine layer. Fog lingers at the edges, teasing the bridges with a whisper of moisture, though for now, the city remains comfortably visible. This evening might inspire a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a cozy gathering in a caf\u00e9 where warm drinks can be savored. For those heading into the night, a light jacket layered over a sweater will keep the chill at bay, inviting one to embrace the quiet allure and contemplative atmosphere the city offers as the year draws to a close.",
