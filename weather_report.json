    "weather_report": "Houston moves through the late afternoon under a cover of soft gray, the sun slipping in and out of torn seams of cloud. After a heavy ceiling before dawn and looser, broken clouds by morning, the light now is gentle and forgiving, the kind that flatters brick and live oak alike. UV is modest at best and fading with the hour, and the day\u2019s clarity is more watercolor than crystal, edges softened, visibility fine but the contrast turned down.\n\nThe rest of the day looks mostly cloudy with occasional brighter breaks, a calm, unhurried mood rather than a dramatic one. Dress in easy layers: a breathable long\u2011sleeve or light sweater you won\u2019t mind carrying if a brighter patch warms the sidewalk, perhaps a scarf if you run cool after sunset. It\u2019s a good afternoon for small, ordinary things\u2014an amble around the block to stretch the legs, watering the plants, finishing the chapter you started this morning, or simmering something simple while the sky dims. If you need to be out, sunglasses are optional; the light is more pearly than sharp.",
