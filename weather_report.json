    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips past midnight with a damp hush; clouds are settled low and the air feels near, as if the suburb is holding its breath before the next act. Light rain is due to drift through the small hours, leaving footpaths gleaming and the night slightly blurred at the edges. By dawn the showers should ease and the morning likely begins in soft grey, then loosens into brighter breaks; when the sun finds its gap, it will feel sharp for the season and the UV will climb quickly even if patches of cloud hang on, so expect a day of shifting light rather than steady sunshine.\n\nDress for a quiet, wet-tilted start: a light waterproof over something breathable, shoes that forgive puddles, and for later, sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen tucked in your bag. It\u2019s weather that suits unhurried tasks\u2014clear the last emails, lay out tomorrow\u2019s kit, or take a brief hood-up walk for bread when the rain slackens. As the day unfolds, time errands between showers and claim a modest corner in a caf\u00e9, letting the newly rinsed light spill across a page or two.",
