    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a damp midnight sky, the air cool and smelling faintly of wet pavement. Light showers flirt with the small hours and are expected to lean into steadier rain toward dawn, softening the edges of the streets and keeping the night dim and quiet. Expect a muted sunrise behind a low, quilted ceiling; clarity will be poor at first with slick roads and beaded windshields. Sunshine will be scarce early and the UV negligible, perhaps nudging to modest only if the cloudwork loosens later. It\u2019s not an unpleasant night so much as a hushed one.\n\nDress for drizzle and puddles: a light waterproof layer, closed shoes, and an umbrella you won\u2019t mind carrying. For now, the wise move is indoors\u2014finish the chapter you\u2019ve been putting off, set the kettle, cue a low-volume record. Early risers might time errands between showers or take a slow tram ride and watch the rain paint the windows, saving outdoor plans for when the sky decides to forgive.",
