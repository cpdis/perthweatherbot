    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into a calm, glass-clear night, the day\u2019s harsh edges polished away to a quiet sheen. The sky is clean as a whistle and stays that way through late evening and past midnight; with the sun long gone, UV is effectively nil and the world softens under starlight. It\u2019s the sort of clarity that makes distant sounds carry and streetlights feel almost theatrical. Expect the mood to remain stable and pleasant rather than cold or clammy; when the sun returns, it should be a bright, unfiltered start, and UV will rise quickly once morning takes hold.\n\nDress in easy layers this evening\u2014a light shirt and a soft jacket will be comfortable if you linger outdoors. Consider a gentle after-dinner stroll, a slow lap around the block with the dog, or a few unhurried minutes on the porch to let the day exhale. If you\u2019re in a practical mood, water the garden now that the heat is off and set out what you need for an early, sun-sparked start tomorrow.",
