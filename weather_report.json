    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is torn into quiet scraps of cloud, the town dimly varnished by streetlight. The air feels calm, a touch heavy, and the night has that muffled hush that makes small sounds travel. Stars are mostly veiled and horizon lines are softened; clarity is low, but gentle rather than grim.\n\nToward the small hours the cloud thickens, and by the first hint of morning a light rain looks likely, enough to stipple footpaths and freshen the gardens. Sunshine will be scarce at daybreak; UV is negligible overnight and should stay low into the morning unless skies surprise us by opening. Expect a muted, grey start, the sort of damp that invites a light layer and a thin waterproof, closed shoes, perhaps an umbrella tucked under the arm. It\u2019s good weather for unhurried tasks: tidying a desk, laying out tomorrow\u2019s kit, brewing something warm, or taking a quiet, brisk walk under the awnings before the city fully wakes. If you\u2019re commuting early, allow a touch more time and let the day ease you in.",
