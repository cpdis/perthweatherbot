    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a tapestry of muted gray clouds blankets the sky, hinting at the rain that is expected to grace the city later today. With a chill in the air, one can sense the heaviness of moisture moving in, making for a day that is more somber than sunny. The high of 53 degrees feels more like a gentle nudge towards warmth\u2014perfect for cozy layers. One might find comfort in a thick cardigan or a well-loved jacket, accompanied by a scarf to ward off the crisp breeze that wafts in from the west, rustling the trees and whispering promises of rain.\n\nLooking toward the horizon, the marine layer lingers just off the coast, a gentle shadow that softens the outlines of the Golden Gate and the iconic skyline. With clouds embracing the city and the promise of rain, this is not the day for grand outdoor adventures. Instead, the inviting warmth of a local caf\u00e9 becomes a refuge\u2014an ideal spot to sip a warm drink while watching the world go by, oblivious to the chill. As the clock ticks toward evening, balance the quiet of the rain with the hum of city life, perhaps taking a leisurely stroll through the bustling streets, umbrella in hand, to experience the unique charm of a drizzly San Francisco afternoon.",
