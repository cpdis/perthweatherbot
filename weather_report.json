    "weather_report": "The air hangs heavy over Downtown San Francisco, cloaked in a shroud of thick clouds that promise rain later in the afternoon. A cool breeze from the west hints at the unsettled weather, stirring the streets with a gentle chill. The temperature dances around the low fifties, but as the day tips towards evening, it\u2019s likely to retreat further, leaving a palpable dampness in its wake. The expected rain, with a probability of sixty percent, seems almost inevitable, casting a moody atmosphere that wraps the city in a subdued allure.\n\nAs winter light wanes, the possibility of a soft drizzle beckons one to seek shelter in a cozy caf\u00e9 rather than meander through the park. Those who are venturing out may wish to don an extra layer\u2014a warm jacket paired with a scarf would suit the cool conditions well. The weather invites the simplicity of warmth and comfort, making it a perfect day to unwind indoors with a good book or to enjoy the quiet companionship of a friend over steaming cups of coffee. Amidst the gloom, one might find solace in the gentle moments this weather inspires, cherishing the cozy corners of the city that are often overlooked.",
