    "weather_report": "Busselton wakes to a bright, open sky, the last scraps of morning cloud already loosening their grip. Through late morning the sun will take charge, with only scattered puffs, then a cleaner blue by early afternoon. The air looks clear and salt-bright, the horizon sharp, and the day will feel warm in the sun, easier in the shade. UV will be strong to very strong as the sun climbs, so the light will carry that hard Australian sparkle that invites you out and warns you to take care.\n\nDress for ease: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen on every bit that sees the light; keep a bottle of water nearby. It\u2019s the kind of day to sip a quiet coffee on a verandah, hang the washing to let it drink the breeze, then stroll a shaded path or run a couple of errands before the sun hits its stride. Save the longer wander for later, when the sea breeze freshens the afternoon and the light softens.",
