    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco is wrapped in a quiet embrace of rain, the soft patter against roofs and pavements a lullaby that invites warmth. The air, cool at around 52 degrees, holds a promise of a slight rise to 54 as the night transitions into day. The omnipresent clouds create a thick canvas above, shrouding both the Golden Gate and city skyline in a misty veil that hints at a lingering marine layer. Winds from the south-southeast stir at 14 mph, accelerating occasionally with gusts, whispering through the streets and rustling leaves\u2014an invitation to remain tucked indoors.\n\nThe forecast for today reveals the rain is far from over, with a steady downpour expected to persist. Under a blanket of gray, temperatures aim for a steady 59 degrees, the dampness maintaining its grip. With every drop contributing to new rainfall amounts approaching an inch, the atmosphere feels dense, filled with that invigorating scent of fresh rain mingling with the cool air. \n\nAs you contemplate stepping out, consider donning a waterproof jacket, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater, accompanied by sturdy footwear to navigate puddles. The long day ahead may offer opportunities for quiet reflections in the comfort of a caf\u00e9, or perhaps indulging in a satisfying book from the warmth of your home, where the outside world remains a distant soundscape of drizzles and whispers.",
