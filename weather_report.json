    "weather_report": "Midday finds Perth under a polished, uncomplicated blue; the sun is frank and generous, shadows short and crisp, the horizon sharp enough to make you squint. The rest of the afternoon looks equally clear, light running clean and bright toward evening with no sign of cloud to soften it. UV will be strong through the early afternoon, easing only as the day tilts toward five, so it\u2019s a day for shade when you can find it and steady sips of water between errands. Air feels dry and open, the kind that rewards an unhurried breath.\n\nDress for ease: light fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen as familiar as your keys. Keep a thin layer handy for after dusk when the warmth ebbs. It\u2019s good weather for modest pleasures\u2014an unhurried lunch under an awning, a quiet lap of the block with a podcast, a browse through a bookshop, or a late-afternoon amble by the river when the light softens and the city relaxes its grip.",
