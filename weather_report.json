    "weather_report": "Morning in Floreat arrives clean and bright, the day already shaking off any haze. The forecast shows clear skies through late morning into early afternoon, so expect unabashed sunshine and excellent visibility. With the spring sun unfiltered, the UV will climb quickly around midday; it\u2019s a day that looks simple and inviting, but asks for a bit of respect from the light.\n\nDress for ease: breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen as habit rather than afterthought. It\u2019s good weather for small, unrushed things\u2014a coffee on a shaded veranda, a meander through Bold Park\u2019s quieter paths, hanging the week\u2019s washing to drink in the air, or cycling to the shops before the sun gets insistent. Keep water handy and let errands cluster in the gentler edges of the day; around noon, favor the shade and let the blue sky do the talking.",
