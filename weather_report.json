    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night embraces the city with a steady rain, the air thickened by the sounds and scents of moisture. The streets glisten as headlights dance off the slick pavement, while the persistent winds whip through the alleyways, bringing whispers of the storm. As dawn approaches, expect the rain to persist, cascading in waves until mid-morning, followed by intermittent showers and the distant rumble of thunderstorms. The gray clouds curtain the sky, swallowing the views of landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, as fog and a heavy marine layer settle into the nooks and crannies of the city's iconic vista.\n\nFor those venturing out today, consider dressing in layers\u2014an umbrella will be your companion, as will a water-resistant jacket, to stave off the chill that accompanies this wet tapestry. Perhaps a cozy corner caf\u00e9 beckons, where you can sip warm brews while observing the world blur past in shades of gray and mid-twilight. Alternatively, grab your favorite book or some board games to enjoy at home, creating a sanctuary against the tempest. The weather may feel tumultuous, but in this cozy setting, moments of solitude can transform into cherished memories as the city weaves its stormy story.",
