    "weather_report": "Under the light gray sky of Subiaco, where clouds weave intricately like a master's brushstrokes, the early morning's gentle drizzle has amplified into a steady, moderate rain as the afternoon matures. The air carries a fresh scent, unburdened by sunshine, whispering tales of respite perhaps for the sun-weary. Shadows remain subdued, colors unsaturated, offering a kind of watercolor view of the world. The breeze cools the skin while the absence of sunlight provides a soft, diffused glow, with no UV index to worry about today. The mood is subdued but peaceful, inviting introspection. Stepping outside, one might find solace in the quiet pitter-patter of rain on leaves and roofs.\n\nWith such a symphony of rain, today calls for a wardrobe of layers \u2013 a waterproof jacket to keep dry and comfortable, and perhaps boots suitable for the puddled paths. Armed with an umbrella, the world becomes a personal sphere of gentle sounds and nature's rhythm. It's a perfect afternoon for visiting a cozy caf\u00e9, the ambient hum of chatter and steam complementing the outside melody. Perhaps it's a day best spent nestled by a window, a hot drink cradled in your hands, as you lose yourself in a long-neglected book. For those drawn outwards, a leisurely walk, the soles of your shoes splashing softly, can be a contemplative journey. The weather may not invite basking in warmth, but it opens the door to a quieter kind of joyful reflection.",
