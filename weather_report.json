    "weather_report": "Evening drapes Katy in a soft, pewter sky; the day never quite brightened. Morning wore a solid overcast and by midday a light, passing rain stippled streets and lawns. Now, the night is damp and muted, with halos around porch lights and the gentle scent of wet concrete. Sunshine was scarce and shy; the UV stayed subdued and fades to nothing at this hour. Visibility is serviceable but softened by lingering moisture, the horizon smudged rather than crisp.\n\nDress for comfort more than bravado: a light waterproof or hooded jacket over easy layers, closed shoes with some grip, and a small umbrella if you don\u2019t fancy fine drizzle. It\u2019s a night for practical, unhurried things \u2014 a quick grocery run, returning a library book, a slow loop with the dog, or putting tools back in order in the garage while the damp air settles. If you stay in, set up tomorrow\u2019s coffee, draft a note to a friend, or let a calm film play while the clouds keep their steady vigil.",
