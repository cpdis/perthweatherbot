    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a gentle evening, the sky mostly open with only a few strays of cloud and a promise of clear, quiet hours after midnight. The air feels steady and uncomplicated; visibility is clean, stars should sharpen as the night deepens, and the UV index is, for practical purposes, asleep until after sunrise. If these clear skies linger into morning, the first light will be bright and direct, lending the day a hard gleam.\n\nIt\u2019s a night for comfort: short sleeves if you\u2019re moving, a light layer if you\u2019re lingering on a porch or walking the dog. Consider a slow circuit of the block, airing out the house for a spell, watering the garden before bed, or jotting down tomorrow\u2019s errands while the streets are hushed. If you\u2019re up early, expect a bright start and plan shades and sunscreen once the sun is up; for now, lean into the calm and let the quiet do its work.",
