    "weather_report": "As dawn gracefully yields the reins to a new day in Subiaco, the sky stretches out like a vast canvas, free of blemishes, untouched by clouds. It's a morning kissed by clarity, promising a symphony of sunlight throughout the day. The air, tinged with the gentle whispers of a breeze, hints at warmth that will gather strength as the sun climbs higher. The absence of obstacles between the sun's golden rays and the earth means the UV index is likely to swell, urging you to arm yourself with sunscreen and a hat if you fancy wandering outside during the sunlit hours. \n\nThe day invites you to unwind, perhaps with a leisurely stroll under the watchful gaze of the sun or an afternoon spent nestled on a park bench, with a book as company. For attire, think loose and airy; a light shirt paired with comfortable trousers or a flowing dress that dances with every step you take. As the shadows gradually lengthen, consider a moment of stillness to savor the sun's final performance as it dips below the horizon. The peacefulness of the day, with its unbroken blue expanse above, offers a fine backdrop to life's gentle rhythms\u2014uncomplicated yet sublime, leaving you with no expectation except to simply be, in good company, and contemplation.",
