The air feels rinsed and quiet, colors turned down a notch, distance slightly smudged. Sun is shy today\u2014more glow than beam\u2014with only fleeting brighter moments at best; UV stays subdued under the overcast, though a brief midday opening can still nip fair skin if you linger. Visibility is fair but muted, edges softened by drizzle and low cloud.\n\nExpect on-and-off light rain through the day, a steady gray rhythm rather than a downpour. It\u2019s a day for a light waterproof and easy layers, closed shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and a compact umbrella. Pleasant in a hushed, practical way: good for a slow errand to the grocer, a gallery or library visit, a coffee by a window while showers slide past, or a quick loop around the block between bursts. Save anything ambitious for a clearer spell; let the weather set a gentler tempo.",
