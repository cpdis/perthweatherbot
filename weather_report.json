    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Downtown San Francisco, a soft light casts a warm glow, brightening the crisp morning air. Currently, the city enjoys a mostly sunny disposition with temperatures hovering near the mid-fifties. A gentle north-northeast breeze whispers through the streets, offering a slight chill that mingles with the day's clarity. While fog may linger on the fringes, obscuring the distant hills, the heart of the city remains inviting and clear, perfect for a morning stroll or leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect temperatures to trend downwards as the afternoon approaches, gently nudging towards the high fiftys before settling into a cool evening. Tonight, clouds will weave a delicate blanket overhead, softening the twilight air as temperatures sink to around forty-six. For those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater is advisable to ward off the evening chill. Given the inviting weather, consider a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps a visit to a cozy gallery or a quiet spot to unwind with a good book as day slips into night, blending seamlessly into the city's rhythm.",
