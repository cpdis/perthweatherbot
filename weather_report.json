    "weather_report": "Subiaco currently sits under a modest chessboard of scattered clouds, their textures varying in the late February eve, playing a gentle game of hide and seek with the retiring sun. As the day relinquishes its grip to the twilight, the lack of direct sunlight creates a tableau deceptively cooler than one might anticipate from a day nestled softly in the tail end of summer. Those who dare venture out into this deceptive cool are advised to arm themselves with an appropriately light jacket, nothing more stern than a cardigan, perhaps lined with supple cotton. \n\nAs we cast our gaze into the crystal ball, a forecast of fewer clouds is envisaged, peeking through just enough to lend a tender glow to the romantic ruins of Subiaco Abbey, yet not enough to threaten the tender skin with harsh UV. An evening stroll around the quaint city streets would be an enchantingly mundane activity, the kind of evening where one finds new appreciation for the familiar \u2013 newly discovered floral sprouting between cobblestones, or the curl and sway of windblown leaves chasing each other in the dusky light.",
