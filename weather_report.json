    "weather_report": "In the hushed moments of early morning, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in a cool embrace, with hints of rain whispering through the slight chill that lingers. The city is relatively calm, a tranquil prelude before the bustle of the day, and though the forecast suggests a slight chance of rain after dawn, the skies hold mostly clear and quietly resolute. The low temperature hovers around the low forties, clothing the streets in a subdued hue, accentuated by the soft glow of city lights fighting against the encroaching dawn.\n\nAs the sun arcs higher, Wednesday promises a blend of warmth and lingering chill, with temperatures nearing the mid-fifties but gently retreating as afternoon approaches. The wind, a gentle southward breeze, carries with it the scent of the ocean, mingling with the promise of sun-dappled streets and the possibility of brief moments of serenity beneath the expansive blue. Expect clarity to break through as the day progresses, though the early whispers of the marine layer may still linger in your peripheral vision near the bridge. Dressing in layers will serve you well; a light jacket will shield against the morning\u2019s crispness while remaining comfortable for the afternoon sun. \n\nGiven the serene backdrop, a stroll along the Embarcadero may feel especially invigorating, as the golden rays dance upon the water, beckoning you to partake in the understated beauty of the day. Alternatively, the city\u2019s many caf\u00e9s invite you to savor a moment with an aromatic cup, where you can watch the world awaken. Whether you find solace in quiet reflection or choose to engage with the vibrant pulse of the city, the day ahead holds an air of promise, wrapped in the gentle cadence of a new beginning.",
