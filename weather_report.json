    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is a single piece of slate, the streetlights haloed in a damp hush. The night is overcast and settling toward light, occasional rain before dawn, the kind that freckles glass and softens edges. Sunshine will be scarce when morning stirs; if it peeks through at all it will be fleeting, a brief silver behind cloud. UV is quiet now and will likely stay muted under the blanket of grey, though a short, brighter spell around midday could still warrant a dab of sunscreen. Expect a day that feels subdued and a touch cool to the skin, the air clean but not especially clear, like a page smudged by a careless thumb.\n\nDress in light layers with a waterproof shell and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles; slip a compact umbrella into your bag and call it insurance. Let the weather nudge you into unhurried choices: a slow early coffee under an awning, a tram ride to run small errands while the world wakes, a lap of the library, a tidy of the desk you\u2019ve been putting off. If the rain eases, take a short walk to watch the morning shine on wet brick and eucalypt leaves, then drift back inside feeling quietly restored.",
