    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a clean, blue noon sky, the light sharp as glass and shadows trimmed neat along the footpaths. The forecast holds steady and simple: clear through the afternoon, with that bright, unblinking sun at full stride now and the UV running strong, easing only as the day tilts toward evening. The air feels honest and dry, visibility wide open, the sort of clarity that makes colors pop and minds wander.\n\nDress light and breathable; a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are not optional, and a bottle of water will keep the edges soft. As the breeze freshens later, a loose overshirt won\u2019t go astray. This looks like a day for ordinary pleasures: a shaded lunch in a courtyard, a short errand on foot beneath the purple jacarandas, laundry strung to drink the dry air, or a gentle loop around the block as the light mellows. Save any garden watering for late, when the sun\u2019s bite has gone and the evening begins to speak.",
