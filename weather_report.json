    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, an intriguing blend of sun and cloud sets the stage. While the day starts with a tentative brightness, it veils the promise of rain, hinting at a gentle transition toward the evening's impending showers. The air holds a crisp chill, urging residents to dress in layers, wrapping themselves in cozy attire that could withstand a sudden drop in temperature. Light jackets and scarves will provide comfort against the west wind, which stirs softly at around five to twelve miles per hour.\n\nAs one gazes toward the horizon, the familiar outline of the Golden Gate Bridge emerges, partially shrouded by a marine layer that clings to the coastal edges, creating a mystical silhouette against the backdrop of the bay. The chance of precipitation looms like an artist's brush, with possibility of a soft drizzle beginning after four o'clock. Today's activities might lead one to a leisurely stroll through neighborhoods adorned with vibrant murals or a visit to the local caf\u00e9, where the scent of fresh pastries fills the air. As evening beckons, the clouds will deepen, and rain will likely steal quietly across the skyline, making it a suitable backdrop for introspective indoor pastimes, perhaps with a good book or a warm mug of tea in hand.",
