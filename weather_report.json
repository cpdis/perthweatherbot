    "weather_report": "Dawn comes quietly to Busselton, with a clear sky already stretching pale and clean above the water. The air feels gentle and untroubled, the kind that invites a deep breath before the day gathers pace. As morning advances, the sun will take firm hold and pour bright, unfiltered light across town, with visibility sharp and the horizon crisp. UV will climb quickly after breakfast, so the pleasant early cool will give way to a day that asks for shade and patience with the glare.\n\nDress light but start with a soft layer for the early hours; swap to breathable fabrics, a hat, and sunglasses once the sun lifts. A small bottle of sunscreen in your pocket will earn its keep. This is a morning for an unhurried walk along a quiet street or foreshore before the heat ripens, a coffee on a veranda, or a few easy errands while the light is kind. Later, slip indoors or find a patch of dappled shade with a book, letting the bright, cloudless afternoon pass without argument.",
