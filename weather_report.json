    "weather_report": "As the city settles into the stillness of the night, Downtown San Francisco embraces a gentle coolness, the temperature dipping to a comfortable 48 degrees. The skyline is veiled in a soft, partial cloud cover, softly accentuating the twinkling lights that punctuate the urban landscape. A light breeze whispers through the streets, caressing the city with a hint of chill, making it advisable to wrap a light jacket around your shoulders if you venture out.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the sun will rise with greater enthusiasm, casting warm beams across the city. As the morning unfolds, expect a pleasantly sunny day, the temperature rising to nearby 60 degrees but retreating to a soft 57 by the afternoon. The North wind will remain a gentle presence, enhancing the clarity of the day while keeping the air refreshingly crisp. Given these conditions, attire should strike a balance: layers that allow for flexibility as the sun warms the streets, perhaps a light sweater or cardigan suitable for brunch at a corner caf\u00e9 or a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. The beauty of the day invites a simple outing\u2014a visit to the local market or a walk through a neighborhood park, capturing the serene essence of early January in this vibrant city.",
