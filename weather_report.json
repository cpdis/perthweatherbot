    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Busselton opens wide and bright, with just a handful of soft clouds strolling across a mostly clear sky. The sun has lost its midday bite and is sliding toward a gentler, honeyed light; UV is easing now and will drop to low by early evening, though a hat and sunglasses still earn their keep before sunset. The air looks clean and far-seeing, colors sharp around the streets and shoreline, the kind of clarity that feels simple and honest.\n\nExpect this polite, mostly sunny pattern to hold into the evening: a clear, settled end to the day. Dress light, maybe a breezy shirt with an easy layer for after dusk. Good hours for ordinary pleasures\u2014an unhurried wander along the foreshore, a quick ride to shake out the legs, a takeaway coffee enjoyed on a bench while the light turns amber, or a few quiet errands on foot before the shops shut. It\u2019s pleasant weather that asks little and rewards attention.",
