    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco feels calm and cool, with scattered clouds drifting like loose pages across the sky. The morning ahead looks part-sunny, part-shaded\u2014bright spells slipping between those clouds around and after sunrise, the light soft rather than glaring. UV is low now, but it will wake quickly with the sun and trend to the sharp side by late morning whenever the cloud thins. Air clarity should be good, with a gentle brightness rather than a hard, blue blaze.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant start for light layers: a tee and a cardigan or a thin jacket now, sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen tucked in your bag for later. This is weather for an unhurried walk to the corner cafe, a quiet cycle on back streets, or watering the garden before the day warms. If you\u2019re staying in, open a window, let the early light find the room, and read a few pages while the neighborhood stirs.",
