    "weather_report": "As the afternoon descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a brooding blanket of clouds envelops the city, promising rain that has already begun to etch its presence on the pavement. The high of 59 hangs just above a leaden sky, while the winds whistle from the south, ushering in droplets that glimmer on their descent. Visibility is limited, obscured by the thick curtain of overcast that smothers any hopes of sun. The impending rain, accompanied by gusts that flirt with 30 mph, fosters a damp chill that seeps through layers. \n\nAs evening approaches, the rain persists with unrelenting determination, transforming the city into a reflective landscape, the streets glistening under the muted light. The temperature will gradually rise, teasingly promising a low of around 55, before easing into the embrace of the night. Dressing warmly is a must: consider a raincoat paired with something cozy underneath, perhaps a sturdy umbrella to weather the deluge. Rather than outdoor excursions, take refuge in the comforts of home or a cozy caf\u00e9, where the rhythmic patter of rain against the windows provides a perfect backdrop for leisurely reading or quiet contemplation.",
