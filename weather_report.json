    "weather_report": "As the moon dials down over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a calmness enveloped in clarity. Overnight air remains crisp, hovering around a pleasant 51 degrees, with a gentle north northeast breeze whispering across the Bay, heralding a refreshing sunrise. The scent of the ocean lingers faintly, hinting at the day's potential, unmarred by the usual fog that often cloaks the iconic skyline. In its place, a golden promise of sunshine emerges, warming the heart of the city, with temperatures nudging toward a balmy 68 as the sun climbs higher, before gracefully settling back to a cozy 63 by afternoon.\n\nDress in layers to embrace the temperate embrace of the day: perhaps a light sweater over a t-shirt for the morning and a lightweight jacket for the breezy afternoon; nothing too heavy will do, as the north winds dance softly around 15 mph. Given the forecast\u2019s enchanting invitation, it\u2019s a splendid day for a leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s many parks or to indulge in a quiet moment at an outdoor caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while watching the world percolate with life. With clear skies ahead and a delightful warmth blooming, this day unfurls like a well-loved book, inviting each to partake in its simple pleasures.",
