    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco awakens to a comforting shroud of rain, a gentle reminder of nature's rhythm. The sky, thick with clouds, mirrors the calm murmur of droplets tapping against window panes, enveloping the city in a muted embrace. As the night gives way to dawn, temperatures feel cozy around 52 degrees, slowly climbing to a mild 54. Winds whisper softly from the south, barely rustling the leaves, but promising a notable shift in mood as the sun seeks to break through the gloom.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the forecast promises a glimpse of clarity amidst the persistent rain, with a tentative hope for partial sunshine by midday. Highs will flirt with the low 60s, while the afternoon may invite temperatures to recede slightly. With a 70% chance of rain lingering, it's advisable to don waterproof attire\u2014perhaps a light rain jacket over a warm layer, and sturdy shoes to navigate the puddle-strewn streets. Such a day may not beckon a grand adventure outdoors, but a cozy exploration of local caf\u00e9s or an intimate stroll through the historic streets could unfold delightful surprises. Finding refuge in the warm glow of a favorite bookshop or enjoying a leisurely afternoon at a quiet gallery can transform the rainy day into a peaceful retreat, perfect for reflection.",
