    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air is thick with the whisper of patchy fog, curling around the corners of familiar landmarks. The sky hangs in a muted gray, the kind that suggests a hushed transition into night, with temperatures gently dipping towards 49 degrees. West-northwest winds carry the coolness through the streets, a subtle reminder of the city\u2019s oceanic embrace. The fog, while not overwhelming, has begun its dance, particularly in the evening hours, lending the scene an ethereal quality that softens the city\u2019s hard edges.\n\nTomorrow promises a shift, with patches of sunlight breaking through the morning mist before midday, casting a warmer glow over the bustling cityscape. Yet, even as the sun rises high, temperatures will linger around 58, slowly spiraling down to the mid-fifties by afternoon. As the day unfolds, it calls for a layering of light attire\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater or a light jacket to navigate the coolness in shadows cast by the glimmering buildings. In these tranquil hours, one might consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of brewed coffee mingles with the salty air, providing a comforting retreat as the day brightens and the fog begins to retreat.",
