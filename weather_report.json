    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a quilt of broken cloud, the sun slipping in and out like a shy performer testing the stage lights. The morning feels gentle rather than stark, the light softened, the air clear enough to see the day\u2019s edges without glare. No stormy mood in the sky, just a patchwork of brightness and shade that makes footpaths and gardens look freshly washed.\n\nThrough late morning into the afternoon, expect the same on-and-off sunshine, with UV still assertive when the sun breaks through; spring has a way of sneaking color onto skin even under scattered cloud, so a hat, sunglasses, and a dab of sunscreen will serve you well. Light layers and breathable fabrics suit the rhythm of the day. It\u2019s pleasant weather for simple errands on foot, a slow loop around the neighborhood oval, a quiet browse at a bookshop, or tending balcony plants between sunbreaks. If you\u2019re working from home, crack a window and let the softened light and mild air drift in; it\u2019s a day that invites steady, unhurried momentum.",
