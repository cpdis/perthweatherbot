    "weather_report": "Cottesloe eases into night beneath a polished, cloudless dome. The day has let go, leaving salt-tinged air and stars sharpening at the edges. Forecasts keep the sky clean through late evening and into the small hours; with the sun gone, UV is no concern now. If this pattern holds, dawn will arrive bright and unfiltered, the sort of morning that turns quickly, frankly sunny and asks for shade, a hat, and sunscreen once you\u2019re out and about.\n\nIt feels quietly pleasant: an evening for unhurried errands and small comforts. Take a gentle walk to shake off the day, water the herbs, wipe down the balcony table, or read a few pages by an open window. Dress easy and light with a spare layer for the sea breeze; sandals if you\u2019re strolling, a cardigan if you plan to linger near the shore. For tomorrow, consider early outings and a midmorning pause somewhere shaded; the clarity promises simple, beautiful light.",
