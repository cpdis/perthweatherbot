    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle rain lingers in the air, kissing the city streets and refreshing the atmosphere. The clouds, having thickened throughout the day, continue to loom, suggesting a lingering dampness that makes coats and umbrellas essential companions for any evening wanderer. With temperatures settling around a cool 52 degrees, and an expected rise to 54, the sound of raindrops tapping against window panes offers a comforting soundtrack for those at home.\n\nTomorrow promises a brighter disposition, as the sun prepares to grace the city with its glow, lifting spirits and warming the cool air. An anticipated high of 62 will coax residents to step outside, enjoying the invigorating westward breezes. The morning may start draped in a curtain of clouds, but by noon, a vibrant clarity will take hold, ideal for leisurely strolls or caf\u00e9 jaunts. Given the transformative weather, it might be wise to layer up tonight\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a cozy sweater, with sturdy shoes to brave the wet sidewalks. After all, an evening at a quiet bistro, or an introspective walk along the Embarcadero, seems just the right remedy for soul and spirit, as the night air carries a hint of promise for the day ahead.",
