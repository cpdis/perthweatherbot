    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks just past the quietest hours of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco envelops itself in a thick layer of fog, which blankets the city and wraps around its iconic landscapes in a gentle embrace. The streets lie still, the temperature lingering at a cool 49 degrees, as a light north northeast breeze stirs the air, barely visible yet palpable. This marine layer, a classic companion of the bay, softens the outlines of buildings and sweeps over the Golden Gate, creating a scene of almost ethereal beauty that draws the eye inward rather than outward.\n\nAs the first hints of daylight unfurl tomorrow, the fog will gradually recede, revealing patches of blue and a promising sunlight that will grace the afternoon. Expect the day to unfold with warmth, albeit tempered; by midday, temperatures will hover around the mid-50s. It may be wise to layer your attire, adorned with a light jacket to fend off the lingering coolness in the morning, yet transitioning into lighter fabrics as the sun nudges its way through the clouds. Given the pleasant changes throughout the day, embracing a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero could be a refreshing escape, where one can sip coffee while taking in the vibrant ebb and flow of the waterfront community. Alternatively, curling up in a favorite nook of a local caf\u00e9 with a good book could provide a cozy retreat until the sun fully rises and the fog lifts.",
