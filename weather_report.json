    "weather_report": "As the night drapes its gentle cloak across Downtown San Francisco, the city reveals a serene tableau under a mostly clear sky. With a low settling around fifty-two degrees, the coolness embraces the air, inviting those who venture outside to relish the crispness. A westerly breeze has wandered through the streets, its playful gusts hinting at a lively evening. Tomorrow promises to unfurl beneath a bright sun, ushering in a day of warmth with temperatures easing into the mid-sixties, though they may dip slightly as afternoon approaches. \n\nLooking out over the bay, it seems the marine layer remains cloaked in distant shadows, content to keep its secrets for another night. Anyone planning a nighttime outing would do well to throw on a light jacket to ward off the evening chill and perhaps prepare for a cozy caf\u00e9 stop. The cool clarity of the night encourages a stroll along the waterfront where the city lights dance upon the water, subtly mirroring the stars above. It\u2019s a delightful evening, perfect for an unhurried walk or quiet moments spent beneath the starlit sky, infused with the hum of a city that never truly sleeps.",
