    "weather_report": "Morning settles over Katy under a soft gray ceiling. Overnight light rain has eased, leaving the streets darkened and the air a little silken and cool; clouds hold steady, muting the sun and keeping the UV index low. The day looks clear in a quiet way\u2014visibility fine, shadows scarce, edges softened by the overcast. It\u2019s not a dramatic sky, more a thoughtful one, the sort that invites a slower pace and makes colors in the trees and storefronts look richer.\n\nExpect the clouds to linger most of the day with only a slim chance of a stray sprinkle, the kind that vanishes before you can open an umbrella. Dress in light layers with a thin waterproof or windproof shell and comfortable shoes for damp pavement. This is a good morning for ordinary pleasures: a deliberate grocery run, a tidy-up of the workspace, a coffee unhurried at a corner table, or a short neighborhood walk where the lack of glare makes the world easy on the eyes. If you\u2019re heading out later, plan outdoor time without worrying about sun exposure; the sky will keep its gentle lid on things.",
