    "weather_report": "Cottesloe wakes under a quilt of broken cloud, the sun slipping in and out like a shy performer behind the curtain. The light is soft but brightening, the air already warming, and the sea has that brushed-steel sheen that makes the horizon feel both near and far. Visibility is good, with the scene a touch muted by the shifting canopy above.\n\nExpect this patchwork sky to hold through the day, offering intermittent sunshine rather than a blaze. Even so, the UV will be unforgiving by late morning into early afternoon; think wide-brim hat, sunglasses, breathable fabrics, and generous sunscreen if you\u2019re out and about. It\u2019s a pleasant day for ordinary pleasures: a slow coffee on a shaded verandah, a stroll along the foreshore before the glare sharpens, hanging the washing where the breeze can find it, or a midmorning run of errands on foot. After lunch, seek the cooler side of the garden or a library chair by a window, letting the cloud-filtered light do the decorating.",
