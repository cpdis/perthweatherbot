    "weather_report": "Northbridge settles into a quiet night after a day that wore only a few clouds like loose buttons on a blue coat. Earlier, sunshine slipped through freely and the UV felt gentle for November; now it\u2019s all muted, the sky mostly clear with a thin scatter of clouds and no UV to speak of. Visibility is clean and crisp, the kind of clarity that makes porch lights look steadier and distant trees a little more outlined against the dark.\n\nExpect the calm to linger overnight; if those light clouds hold their shape, daybreak should begin bright and easy. Dress with a bit of caution to the chill: a warm sweater or light coat will feel right, and a hat if you\u2019re out for long. This is pleasant weather for small errands and quiet rituals\u2014an unhurried walk to the corner, sorting tomorrow\u2019s bag by an open window, or a short spin around the block with a thermos in hand before turning in. In the morning, sunglasses may earn a place by the door if the sun returns in the same forgiving mood.",
