    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of moisture lingers just above the cityscape, hinting at the night\u2019s potential for drizzle. A layer of clouds hangs like a shroud, softening the urban outlines and quieting the vibrant hum of the streets below. With temperatures resting comfortably around 54 degrees, the night is cool yet inviting, urging its inhabitants to seek warmth, perhaps nestled within the cocoon of a light jacket. The south wind whispers a gentle reminder of the stormy flavors predicted for tomorrow, carrying the scent of impending rain.\n\nAs dawn unfolds on Veterans Day, the city may awaken to a more robust drizzle, transitioning eventually into the steady embrace of rain. The heights of noon could bring a fleeting high of around 61 degrees, though the comfort of warmth will ebb as the afternoon settles. The robust wind from the west-southwest carries a promise of briskness, a reminder that even in the midst of inclement weather, San Francisco's charm persists. Today, the palette of activities may lean toward the coziness offered by local caf\u00e9s or a leisurely indoor museum visit, drawing one away from the developing wetness. As the day progresses and the clouds conspire to drop their bounty, a light raincoat and sturdy footwear would be wise companions for those who choose to embrace the city\u2019s moody allure.",
