    "weather_report": "Midnight has washed the island in a quiet, pewter gloom. Light showers are slipping through the small hours and may linger toward first light, leaving the roads slick and the sea a little restless. Skies will be stubborn at dawn, with only shy breaks likely later; any sunshine will be filtered and brief at first. UV is essentially asleep now and will only wake to modest levels unless the cloud thins more than expected, in which case it can sharpen quickly despite the cool tone of the day. The air feels clean but not crystalline, a soft-focus morning on the way.\n\nDress for damp edges: a light rain shell, a warm layer you won\u2019t mind shedding if the day brightens, and shoes that can take puddles. Pocket sunscreen in case the ceiling lifts. It\u2019s a weather-for-listening sort of night\u2014tea on the veranda, the hush of rain and the hush of quokkas. At first light, trade the swim for a shoreline stroll, check the tide pools after the showers pass, or spin a slow loop on the bike once the pavement dries. Later, if the clouds relent, find a sheltered bench and let the pale sun do its best work while the island yawns awake.",
