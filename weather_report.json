    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp and invigorating, distinctly hinting at the chill of the approaching winter. With a low settling around 49 degrees, the stillness carries that familiar, serene calm of urban evenings. Gentle north-northwest winds will barely rustle the leaves, creating a whisper against the backdrop of this vibrant yet tranquil city. Looking ahead to Wednesday, a promising blanket of sunshine is poised to wrap the city, pushing temperatures to a friendly high near 62 degrees. The golden light will grace the streets, gradually dimming to a softer ambiance by afternoon.\n\nCurrently, the atmosphere is refreshingly clear, with no fog veiling the landscape or teasing the outline of the Golden Gate Bridge. A light jacket would be prudent for this evening stroll, particularly if one ventures near the waterfront, where a nice layer can offer shelter from the coastal breeze. Tomorrow\u2019s sunny embrace invites leisurely explorations; perhaps a slow walk along the Embarcadero, coffee in hand, or indulging in a quiet moment at one of the city's lovely parks. Evenings will invite a return to the warmth of home, possibly settling in with a favorite book or a gentle conversation, the city twinkling beneath a canopy of stars.",
