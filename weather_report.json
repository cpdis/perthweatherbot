The temperature sits comfortably around 47 degrees, with only a whisper of a breeze rustling through the urban landscape. Glimpses of the city lights illuminate the streets, creating a soft glow that contrasts beautifully against the dark sky. \n\nAs dawn breaks, expect a day painted mostly in shades of gray, as clouds dominate the scenery. A delicate chance of rain looms in the afternoon, a mere whisper at 20 percent, shyly suggesting that droplets may grace the pavement between noon and three o\u2019clock. With a high near 56, temperatures will gently mitigate to the lower 50s, inviting visitors to dress in layers that offer both warmth and comfort. Perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater will suffice as one embarks on an afternoon stroll through the city\u2019s charming streets or finds solace in a quaint caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm drink while watching the world pass by. The serenity of the day, combined with a breath of fresh air, beckons one to explore, take a leisurely walk by the waterfront, or simply bask in the muted beauty of a city that wears its clouds like a soft scarf.",
