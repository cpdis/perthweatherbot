    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches Downtown San Francisco, a veil of patchy fog cloaks the surrounding vistas, its ethereal tendrils stretching languidly through the cool night air. The temperature hovers around a brisk 48 degrees, hinting at the crispness of winter. A gentle north wind stirs softly, whispering through the city as it prepares to emerge from the night. By morning, as the sun makes its slow ascent, the fog will gradually recede, unveiling a partly sunny day where temperatures linger in the upper fifties. However, even as daylight breaks, a hint of fog may linger, reminding residents of the marine layer that often graces this coastal enclave.\n\nFor those venturing out today, layering is advisable, with a lighter jacket to ward off the morning chill and perhaps a sweater for comfort as the day transitions. Whether it\u2019s a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the bay air invigorates the spirit, or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9 steeped in the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, the day promises to unfurl with a gentle charm. Embrace the serene coolness of the morning, and take a moment to appreciate the city\u2019s understated beauty as it awakens, shrouded in a transient mist that speaks of the allure of San Francisco's ever-changing weather.",
