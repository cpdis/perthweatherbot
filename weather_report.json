    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun bathes Downtown San Francisco, the city reveals a stunning panorama under a radiant blue sky, unmarred by fog or haze. The air is cool, with the temperature gracefully settling around the mid-sixties, inviting a pleasant and crisp ambiance for the rest of the day. The gentle north-northwest wind whispers through the streets at a modest pace, providing just enough refreshment without the chill of coastal fog that often grips this region. With a clear view stretching across the bay towards the Golden Gate Bridge, it is a splendid day to savor the scenery and indulge in the architectural beauty that lines the cityscape.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the night will lower gently over the skyline, with temperatures dipping to around forty-eight degrees. This transition marks the perfect occasion for a cozy stroll through the illuminated streets, where the remnants of daylight fade into the charm of evening. Such splendid conditions beg for a comfortable layering of attire\u2014perhaps a lightweight sweater or a light jacket to keep the coolness at bay, complemented by a warm scarf for added comfort. Engaging in a leisurely walk along the waterfront or finding a quiet caf\u00e9 to unwind with a good book allows one to savor both the beauty of the evening and the city's vibrant energy. Today, the Golden City truly lives up to its name, promising an evening that's as enchanting as its picturesque views.",
