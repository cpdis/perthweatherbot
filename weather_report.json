    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a quiet hush, clouds knitting themselves thick and close. Any hint of sunshine is long gone and the UV has fallen to nothing; the night looks soft around the edges, streetlights haloed in the moist air. Forecasts call for light rain brushing through late tonight and again after midnight, the kind that dapples pavements and leaves the scent of wet stone. It won\u2019t be a dramatic night, just a muted one, with the sky keeping its secrets and the stars mostly concealed.\n\nDress for cool dampness: a light waterproof or hooded layer, sleeves you can push up indoors, and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. An umbrella is more convenience than necessity, but handy for the stroll between doorways. It\u2019s a good night to linger over an unrushed meal, to duck out for a quiet errand under awnings, or to return home and tidy a corner of the desk while the rain ticks at the windows. If you\u2019re out late or up early, give yourself a gentler pace on the glossy roads and let the evening do its unhurried work.",
