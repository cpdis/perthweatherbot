    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush before dawn, the sky a deep blue with scattered cloud drifting like torn sailcloth. Air feels cool and clean, the streets muted, and the horizon getting ready to silver over; clarity is decent, though the sky will have a matte, textured look rather than a glassy blue. As morning unfolds, cloud is likely to thicken to a broken quilt, letting the sun through in gentle spells rather than bright, uninterrupted bursts.\n\nExpect a day that feels mild and workable: not blazing, not gloomy, just a steady run of soft light and shade. UV will rise once the sun is up, likely moderate to high by late morning even with the veil of cloud, so a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen are still wise. Dress in light layers\u2014a breathable top with a cardigan or light jacket for the early chill, easy to shed as the day warms. It\u2019s a good morning for an unhurried walk to the bakery, watering the balcony herbs, cycling to work while the air is still fresh, or settling by a window with coffee as the softened light brightens the room.",
