    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco basks in the embrace of a pristine afternoon, where the sun casts a warm glow over the city, banishing any remnants of fog to the edges of the bay. The skyline is clear and crisp, revealing familiar contours of Victorian houses mingling gracefully with modern structures. In the distance, the Golden Gate Bridge stands elegantly, its signature hue contrasting against a backdrop of vivid blue skies. The gentle west wind carries a hint of salt, reminding one of the ever-present ocean nearby as it rustles through the streets.\n\nAs evening approaches, the air cools and the temperatures dip pleasantly, settling around a cozy 42 degrees. This shift invites an opportunity for leisurely strolls through the neighborhoods, perhaps stopping for a quiet drink at a local caf\u00e9 or indulging in a peaceful moment in one of the city\u2019s beautiful parks. Layering up with a light jacket would be wise as the night unfolds, ensuring warmth against the gentle south-southwest breeze. For those seeking simple pleasures, perhaps an evening spent wandering along the waterfront will bring the serenity that only San Francisco can provide, illuminated by the soft glow of city lights reflecting on the bay.",
