    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of cloud covers the sky, the vibrant cityscape hinting through the gray veil. A cool breeze stirs from the west, carrying the scent of an impending rain, which is set to shape the rest of the day. Current temperatures hover around 57 degrees but are forecasted to dip slightly by afternoon, creating a chill that nudges one toward a cozy sweater or light jacket. The chance of rain looms at 60%, a reminder to prepare for the intermittent dance of raindrops, as they may gently tap on windowpanes beginning after 11 AM.\n\nFor the afternoon wanderer, the atmosphere suggests an invitation to pursue indoor delights, perhaps a leisurely visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s or an afternoon spent browsing through the galleries in the Mission. The murky backdrop may not be ideal for sweeping views, but it lends a certain charm\u2014encouraging moments of quiet reflection as clouds weave stories overhead. Evening brings a chance of further rain, though it is accompanied by the calming rhythm of falling droplets on rooftops, a soothing soundtrack as one settles in for the night. Dress warmly and embrace the cozy sanctity of indoor spaces, where the spirit of the city remains undeterred by the weather\u2019s whims.",
