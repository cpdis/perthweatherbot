    "weather_report": "Perth drifts into early afternoon under a quilt of soft grey, the light turned silvery and forgiving. The air feels freshly washed, with showers nudging in from mid-afternoon and lingering toward evening; sun, when it shows, will be brief and filtered. Clarity is gentle rather than sharp, horizons a touch smudged in the damp. UV will lift around midday despite the cloud, then ease as the rain thickens, so it\u2019s a day for a little caution if you catch a bright spell.\n\nDress in light layers and a waterproof shell, comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind wet pavements, and tuck a compact umbrella in your bag. A late lunch under an awning suits the mood, or a quiet hour at the library, a gallery, or the hardware aisle to gather bits for a small project at home. If you crave air, take a short riverside walk between passing showers, enjoying that cool, pewter light before the next band of rain pads softly across the city.",
