    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, predawn canopy, the quiet kind of blue that makes roofs and gum leaves look freshly etched. The forecast holds to that clarity from sunrise through the morning, so expect an unfiltered sun and a sky that turns bright and glassy as the day opens. It will feel cool at first and then warm quickly; the light will be sharp, the air clean, and by late morning the UV will be brisk and insistent. In short, a lucid, sun-forward day that flatters everything it touches, while asking for respect at midday.\n\nDress in light layers you can shrug off by mid-morning, with a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen if you\u2019re outdoors for more than a few minutes. This is a good morning for small, unrushed errands on foot, watering the garden before the sun bites, or taking a calm ride to the shops. As the glare builds, let indoor plans take the stage\u2014tidying a shelf, a slow lunch by a window\u2014then step back out when the light softens toward evening for a gentle stroll through the neighborhood.",
