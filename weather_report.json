    "weather_report": "Katy spent the day under a clear, uncomplicated sky, the kind that turns sunlight into a clean gleam on every roofline and windshield. The midday sun had some honest strength to it for winter, enough to warrant shades and a bit of respect for the UV, though the air stayed gentle and dry. Now, evening has settled in with a quiet, transparent darkness; stars feel close, the air a touch crisp on the face, and the UV has faded to nothing. No hint of haze or mischief in the weather, just a steady calm that feels dependable.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant kind of night if you dress for it: keep the light layers from the day and add a soft sweater or an easy jacket if you\u2019re lingering outdoors. A slow walk around the block would feel good, or a few minutes on the porch with a warm mug, listening to the neighborhood breathe. If you\u2019re staying in, crack a window for a moment and let the clear air wander through; if you\u2019re out, take your time and enjoy the hush. Tomorrow looks like more of the same, a simple, sunlit page waiting to be turned.",
