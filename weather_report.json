    "weather_report": "Mid-morning in Nedlands arrives with a softened light and a sky knitting itself into thicker cloud, the air carrying that faint, silvery scent that precedes a light shower. Expect a passing spell of rain late morning, then the day loosens its grip as scattered clouds make room for bright intervals in the afternoon. Clarity will be muted at first and crisper later, and when the sun pushes through it will feel clean and insistent; in this season the UV will be strong around midday even with cloud about, so treat the sunlight with respect.\n\nIt looks like a day for breathable layers and a pocketable rain shell until lunch, then a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen for the clearer stretch that follows. Comfortable shoes that won\u2019t sulk at a sprinkle will serve you well. If you head out now, keep errands short and unhurried; otherwise, let the shower pass and take a gentle riverside walk once the pavements dry, or sit by a caf\u00e9 window with something cool and unhurried, watching the light return in patches. It\u2019s an ordinary Sunday kind of weather, a little changeable, ultimately pleasant if you move with it.",
