    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a splendidly bright sky, with the sun casting a warm glow and the air tasting crisp and fresh. Currently, the temperature hovers around a mild 62 degrees, soon to retreat to a comfortable 60 by afternoon. The north-northeast winds, brisk at 18 mph, add a delightful edge to the afternoon, with occasional gusts that keep the atmosphere lively. Tonight promises a softer touch, as the clouds gently roll in, cradling the city in a partly clouded embrace, while temperatures settle into the comfortable 50s.\n\nThe day looks to be particularly pleasant, devoid of any fog or marine layer, allowing the city\u2019s iconic landmarks to shine clearly against the blue expanse above. This clarity invites an array of leisurely pursuits; perhaps a stroll through the vibrant streets, where caf\u00e9s beckon with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, or a visit to one of the nearby parks to bask in the gentle sunshine. Dressing in layers will be wise \u2014 a light jacket for the breezy moments and a cozy sweater for the evening\u2019s cool embrace. So whether you choose to wander along the waterfront or delve into the city's rich tapestry of culture, today offers a serene canvas to paint your urban explorations.",
