    "weather_report": "Subiaco slides past midnight under a quilt of scattered cloud, the streets hushed, the sky carrying a dim pewter sheen; toward the small hours the cloud thickens, so dawn is likely to arrive filtered and soft, a pale wash rather than a blaze. Sunshine should come in sifted patches at first, with clarity a touch muted but visibility fine; if the cover loosens later, the light will sharpen and the day will feel suddenly present. UV is negligible overnight and at first light, but this is spring and it climbs quickly once the sun clears the rooftops, even with cloud, so keep sunscreen and a brim handy. It\u2019s a night for a light jumper and easy layers you can shed after breakfast, perhaps a quiet stroll to the corner bakery when the ovens wake, or a gentle spin to the station before the rush. As the morning opens, ordinary errands will suit the mood: a coffee with a notebook, a tidy in the garden, a ride to work beneath a mottled sky.",
