    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere thickens with a gentle layer of clouds, whispering promises of a cool evening ahead. The temperature, dipping towards the low 50s, will invite a hint of crispness as the west winds stir softly at around six miles per hour. The sky, mostly cloaked in grey, may obscure the sun\u2019s last rays, casting a tranquil yet muted light over the city\u2019s iconic landmarks. As the coast remains shrouded, the fog drapes itself like a veil across the Golden Gate, hinting at the marine influence so characteristic of this area. \n\nLooking ahead to Washington\u2019s Birthday, the day beckons with the possibility of some sun breaking through the clouds, as temperatures cling to the mid-50s. The winds may usher in a refreshing feel, but the lingering chill will prompt one to layer wisely\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the evening breeze. This is a day to embrace the understated beauty of the city; a meander along the Embarcadero, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 for warm drinks, or a leisurely stroll through the Presidio, where the trees stand sentinel against the lazy fog. Enjoy the quietude that accompanies a holiday, where the path less traveled invites exploration at a leisurely pace.",
