    "weather_report": "As the day's light quietly wanes, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in the embrace of impending rain, the sky a blanket of thick, rolling clouds. The temperature weaves a gentle chill into the evening air, inching downwards towards fifty but promising a mild rise overnight. The robust wind from the west southwest carries with it both a bite and a whisper, gusting with an energy that suggests a storm is ready to unfurl its wings. A delicate dance between raindrops and the bracing gusts spells an 80% chance of tangible droplets gracing the pavement soon, an invitation to the senses to breathe in the fresh scent of wet earth.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will tease its way back into the picture, cautiously emerging after the morning's rain. It may peek out from behind clouds, offering a brief interlude of warmth but keeping the air cool and crisp. A high near fifty-six beckons, and as the day unfolds, one might feel the gentle caress of diminishing temperatures, falling to around fifty-three. For those venturing out tonight, a light jacket layered against the wind is wise\u2014something reminiscent of a day at the beach, a nod to the coastal spirit that permeates the atmosphere. A stroll by the Embarkadero or a quiet evening in a local caf\u00e9 with a good book would provide a soothing respite from the weather as mist settles in, adding a whisper of mystery to the city\u2019s ambiance.",
