    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere has taken on a moody gray as clouds blanket the sky, promising a steady embrace of rain this afternoon. With temperatures hovering around a cool 62 degrees but steadily dropping to the mid-50s, it feels more like autumn\u2019s gentle whisper than a vibrant day. The south wind sweeps briskly at 18 mph, bringing a fusion of moisture and chill, which is likely to deter those seeking outdoor leisure. The rain, hovering with an 80% chance of arrival, can be expected to sprinkle lightly, barely kissing the ground\u2014though it may still dampen any ambitions for a leisurely stroll.\n\nAs the sun bids adieu beyond the horizon, a 50% chance of lingering showers remains, promising a night cloaked in clouds and quiet solitude around a low of 52. Dress in layers, ideally with a waterproof jacket to stave off the biting chill and unexpected droplets. With the city shrouded in misty hues and a marine layer possibly draping over the Golden Gate, now may be the perfect time to find refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, losing oneself in a book or savoring a warm drink\u2014a solace against the cool, damp air. Such a day invites introspection rather than bustle, making room for quiet moments while the world outside shimmers under the blanket of rain.",
