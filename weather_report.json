    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a quiet, blue-black after-midnight with a quilt of broken cloud softening the streetlights and keeping the stars at bay. Toward dawn a light, obliging rain is likely to drift through, so the morning will arrive hushed and silver rather than bright. Sunshine looks scarce early; any blue that does appear later will be brief and filtered. The UV index is negligible overnight and low at first light, nudging toward moderate only if the cloud loosens in the late morning. Expect a gentle, low-contrast day with clean, wet pavements and softened edges, more satin than sparkle.\n\nDress in easy layers with closed shoes, and tuck a compact rain jacket or umbrella by the door for the first commute. It\u2019s a good morning for unrushed, ordinary rituals: brew something warm, clear a corner of the kitchen, or take a short, umbrella-paced walk when the drizzle slackens. If you\u2019re heading out early, aim for awnings and arcades; if you can wait, let the first rain pass before errands. The day may not dazzle, but it invites a steady rhythm and small tasks done well.",
