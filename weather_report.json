    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and carries the faint muskiness of the Bay, with temperatures hovering around a cool 43 degrees. The North wind whispers softly, barely strong enough to disrupt the stillness, offering a respite from the usual chill that blankets the city\u2019s hills. The evening sky is a canvas of gently fading stars, hinting at the bright promise of tomorrow.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the sun will rise on a day bathed in sunshine, albeit accompanied by the ever-present chill. With a high near 55, do not be surprised if the afternoon brings a gentle drop to around 52 as the warmth of noon gives way to the cool maritime air slipping down from the headlands. Expect largely clear skies with a sparse veneer of clouds lingering like distant memories. \n\nThe scenery will remain unfettered by fog, allowing wide, sweeping views of the bay and city, making it an ideal time for a quiet morning stroll through Dolores Park or along the Embarcadero. Dress in layers to accommodate the fluctuating temperatures, perhaps a warm jacket for the morning with a light scarf to shield against the brisk wind. As you savor a hot cup of coffee, let yourself be drawn into the vibrant pulse of the city waking up, finding joy in the simple act of taking in the changed light and sounds that signal the arrival of another day in this enchanting coastal enclave.",
