    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crisp tang that whispers promises of a chilly evening ahead. With temperatures dipping to around 43 degrees and a gentle north-northeast breeze at play, there's a hint of quiet clarity in the atmosphere. The clouds, though partly present, seem reluctant to obscure the beauty of the city as the lights twinkle against the darkening sky. \n\nCome dawn, a sunlit canvas awaits, ushering in a high near 61 degrees. The morning will greet you with radiant sunshine, although the chill of the early hours will carry through until midday, encouraging a gradual retreat down to the mid-fifties by the afternoon. The forecast hints at a delightful warmth during the day, but don\u2019t forget that slight breeze can nip at exposed skin. Layering will be your friend today; a light jacket over a cozy sweater will suffice for morning outings, transitioning gracefully to a simple tee as the sun ascends and the city awakens. Given the mild weather, a stroll through the Presidio, where trees stand tall and the paths invite exploration, might just rejuvenate your senses. Alternatively, a quiet afternoon in a local caf\u00e9, savoring warmth in a cup of coffee while watching the world roll by, could perfectly suit the mood of this picturesque day.",
