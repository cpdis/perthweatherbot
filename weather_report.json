    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the city\u2019s skyline emerges, softened by a gentle veil of clouds. With a temperature settling around 45 degrees, the air feels crisp, inviting a cozy wrap of a sweater or jacket to embrace the coolness. The faint whisper of a north northwest wind stirs through the streets, hinting at an understated chill that beckons strollers and night owls alike to seek warmth in a charming caf\u00e9 or take a leisurely walk along the lit pathways.\n\nTomorrow promises a more illuminating embrace, as the sun ascends to shower the city with its gentle rays, climbing to a high near 54. The forecast assures that the afternoon will settle into comfortable temperatures around 52. Yet, shadows dance as the sun descends, perhaps allowing a marine layer to creep in delicately from the bay. The day appears bright and mostly sunny, inviting a palette of light jackets or layers to accommodate both the chill of morning and the warmth of midday. Ideal pursuits might include wandering the lesser-known alleyways, indulging in a good book at a local bookstore, or enjoying a quiet moment in a lesser-traveled park, where the whispers of the urban landscape blend into the serenity of nature.",
