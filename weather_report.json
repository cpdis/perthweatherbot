    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco looks untroubled: a clear sky and bright, mellow light as the day leans toward evening. Sunshine is still generous, with the UV likely elevated for a little while yet before easing quickly near sunset. The air feels clean and the lines of the streets look crisp, with a clear, quiet night waiting in the wings.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant finish to the day\u2014comfortable to warm depending on your patch of shade. Reach for light, breathable clothes, a hat and sunglasses if you\u2019re out before dusk, and tuck a light layer for after dark. Good weather for small, useful pleasures: a slow walk to the shops, watering the garden, a gentle spin on the bike to pick up dinner, or lingering at an outdoor table with a book as the light turns honeyed and the evening settles.",
