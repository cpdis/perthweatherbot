    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle hush blankets the area, the remnants of night still lingering in the form of patchy fog that weaves in and out of the city's contours. The skies, predominantly cloudy at this hour, carry whispers of promise, with temperatures resting at a cool 47 degrees. The north-northwest breeze has just begun to stir, creating a soft rustle among the streets yet to fully awaken. \n\nAs morning progresses, the fog will gradually yield to the embrace of sunshine, revealing a day that peaks near a mild 58 degrees, though afternoon shadows will conspire to bring temperatures down a notch. The golden beams will battle the marine layer, which retreats but surely leaves traces along the bay. For those venturing out, a light layer is prudent, perhaps a soft sweater or a casual jacket, particularly as the lingering chill may cling to the air. It might be the perfect afternoon for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps savoring a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s numerous parks, where the peaceful sound of rustling leaves harmonizes with the day's unfolding beauty.",
