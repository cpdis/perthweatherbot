    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon brings a curious interplay of sun and clouds, where hints of brightness weave through the mottled sky. Though temperatures hover around a cool 59 degrees, a gentle south wind adds a chill that can be felt as the day progresses. The forecast calls for an increasing likelihood of rain, with a 40% chance leading into the evening. As the hours dwindle, those clouds will deepen, setting a stage for a much stronger 90% chance of rain tonight, making it wise to keep umbrellas handy as the city prepares for the impending downpour.\n\nCurrently, visibility appears somewhat hazy, with a potential marine layer lingering in the distance, obscuring the defined outlines of the Golden Gate. While not particularly unpleasant at this moment, the air carries a palpable sense of moisture, urging a choice of attire that balances comfort against the chill; layers are essential, perhaps a light jacket paired with a scarf to fend off the day\u2019s breeze. As afternoon transitions into dusk, a stroll along a quieter neighborhood street or visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink complements the weather beautifully. The dancing light of the fading sun through those clouds could even inspire a brief pause to take in the moment, before the rain takes center stage and evening settles in.",
