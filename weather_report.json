    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the streets are damp and quiet, the air brushed with the clean scent of light rain. Showers are set to drift through around breakfast time, keeping the sky a soft grey and the sun mostly tucked away. Expect a muted, low-contrast morning with glistening roads and a gentle patter rather than a drench; visibility stays fine, but the day will lack sparkle at first. UV remains low early under the cloud, though if the cover loosens toward late morning, it can climb quickly for spring, so treat any bright breaks with respect.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for a light waterproof layer and comfortable closed shoes, with a small umbrella tucked in your bag and an extra layer in case it brightens. The mood suits a slow coffee on Rokeby Road while the showers ebb, a grocery run between drips, or a brisk, rain-jacket walk to clear the head once the radar shows a lull. If the sky opens briefly later, steal a few minutes outdoors; otherwise, let the weather set a quieter tempo and keep plans close to home.",
