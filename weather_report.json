    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco cloaks itself in a shroud of rain, with a dense gray sky pressing down on the city. As the afternoon progresses, the steady pulse of precipitation carries a promise of moisture, each drop contributing to a symphony of sounds against rooftops and pavement. The chill in the air bites softly, urging layers of warmth\u2014perhaps a medium-weight coat over a cozy sweater, paired with waterproof footwear to fend off puddles that glisten in muted light. Gusty winds dart through the streets, reminding those out and about to hold onto their hats, as the city's character takes on a sullen elegance under this clouded sky.\n\nAs night approaches, the rain's presence becomes ever more pronounced, drenching the landscape and maintaining an unwavering 100% chance of continued downpours. The atmosphere weighs heavy, yet there\u2019s a certain beauty in the muted colors of the twilight, as city lights begin to flicker on, casting a warm glow through the murky veil. Without the usual clarity gifted by sunlit days, the view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the surrounding hills seems softened, bleached of sharp contrasts, leaving behind a dreamy haze. It\u2019s a perfect evening for a quiet night in: a cozy caf\u00e9 with a good book, or perhaps trying your hand at cooking a new recipe while the world outside enjoys its cleansing rain.",
