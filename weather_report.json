    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfurls with a promise of sunshine, guided by the gentle caress of a north wind. As daylight stretches over the city, you\u2019ll find yourself greeted by bright skies, allowing the pastel hues of the landscape to emerge vividly. The temperature sits comfortably near sixty-three degrees, with cooler air settling in as the afternoon nears. While fog may linger in the coastal nooks, the horizon is largely clear, with the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the undulating hills standing proudly against the backdrop of a brightening sky.\n\nAs the day progresses, you might consider slipping into a light sweater to fend off the gradual drop in warmth, especially as evening approaches and the temperature dips towards the pleasant forty-nine degrees. It is a splendid day for a leisurely stroll among the vibrant streets, perhaps meandering through the Ferry Building Marketplace, sampling local treats, or finding a cozy corner at an outdoor caf\u00e9 to sip on a warm beverage as you watch the world pass by. With today\u2019s pleasant conditions inviting exploration, embrace the allure of this stunning city, where each corner carries the whispers of history and the bustle of life interweaves with the scenery.",
