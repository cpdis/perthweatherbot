    "weather_report": "As the early hours embrace Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a dark, rain-soaked shroud, as if nature herself has drawn the curtains against the inevitable storm. The rooftops glisten under the relentless drizzle, which whispers promises of substantial rainfall through the night. With temperatures lingering in the low fifties, a brisk south wind pushes through the narrow streets, its gusts carrying a chill that speaks of a winter's heart. The chance of precipitation, a steadfast 100%, turns the morning into a symphony of raindrops, composing a melody seemingly echoed in every corner of the city.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a continuation of this water-drenched narrative. Showers will persist through the morning into the afternoon, punctuated by the occasional thunderstorm, while temperatures may rest at a soft 59, dipping as the afternoon wanes and the clouds thicken. Visibility will be reduced, as the marine layer weaves through the hills, wrapping the Golden Gate in a gray, ghostly embrace. It\u2019s a day where bundled layers are necessary\u2014think warm, water-resistant outerwear paired with sturdy shoes, as the sidewalks will shimmer with the reflections of a moody sky. With the storm outside, perhaps a cozy nook in a local cafe, a book in hand and coffee warming your palms, would provide a perfect refuge from the tempest, while the world outside quietly washes anew.",
