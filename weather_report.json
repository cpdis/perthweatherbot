    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of the evening, Downtown San Francisco settles into a cloak of patchy fog that begins to weave its way through the streets after 3 AM. The clouds hang low, wrapping the city in a mostly cloudy shroud, with a mild chill sweeping in from the north northwest. As the hours tick by, the air whispers of a comfortable yet brisk night, promising a low around 47 degrees that begs for an extra layer\u2014a light jacket or cardigan would be wise against the cool breath of the bay.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Sunday, the fog will dance briefly before retreating, unveiling a predominantly sunny canvas for the day. The skies will clear, allowing a gentle warmth to emerge, with temperatures reaching a modest height near 58 degrees by midday before a subtle drop as afternoon approaches. The winds will remain gentle, stirring only lightly from the north northwest, presenting a perfect opportunity to wander through the city, perhaps exploring the contours of Golden Gate Park or indulging in a quiet moment at one of the charming cafes lining the streets. As you step out, a comfortable ensemble, layered for warmth without bulk, will ensure you make the most of this exquisite winter day in San Francisco, where the beauty of the city meets the tranquility of the fog.",
