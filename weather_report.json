    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a pewter sky, the light clean and subdued, as if the town has lowered its voice. By late morning the first light showers slip in and linger into the early afternoon, brushing the streets and softening the view down the avenues; edges blur, colors turn cool and honest. Sunshine stays shy, with only brief glimmers possible between bands of cloud, and the UV kept mostly in check by the overcast\u2014though a midday brightening could nudge it to the moderate side for a moment.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for quiet errands and gentle pacing. A light waterproof jacket over easy layers will feel right, with closed shoes and an umbrella tucked in hand. Consider a slow browse through a bookstore, a coffee by the window where the rain stipples the glass, or a short walk between showers to breathe the petrichor and watch the leaves darken. If you must be out at noon, the sun won\u2019t be fierce, but don\u2019t mistake the softness for safety; spring light can still sneak through the gaps. The afternoon looks damp but calm, more introspective than dramatic, made for small tasks and unhurried company.",
