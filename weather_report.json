    "weather_report": "West Busselton lies under a calm, inky sky just after midnight, a few slow-drifting clouds leaving plenty of stars to breathe through. The air feels gentle and clear, the kind of night that hushes the streets and carries the soft salt of the bay. UV is negligible now and the world is unhurried, the scene more silver and charcoal than color.\n\nToward dawn, those few clouds should thin to a clean sunrise and a bright, mostly sunny day. Expect the UV to surge quickly after the sun lifts, running high through late morning and early afternoon. A light layer suits the small hours; by breakfast, shift to breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, and faithful sunscreen. It looks like a pleasant day if you start early: a quiet wander along the foreshore before the light sharpens, a coffee on the veranda while the day warms, small errands or a gentle spin on the bike, then shade, water, and slower indoor tasks as the sun grows insistent.",
