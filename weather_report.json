    "weather_report": "In the deep embrace of night transitioning to dawn, Subiaco finds itself brushed with gentle, clear skies, promising a serene beginning to the day. The clock ticks past two in the morning, and though the sun has yet to yawn over the horizon, the spirit of the forecast whispers of bright skies ahead. With the atmosphere free from clouds, the clarity of the day is set to unfold like a crisp linen, unmarred and inviting. As you gaze upwards, a vivid tableau is ready to emerge with the coming light, making sunglasses a worthy companion for what's to come. \n\nThe crispness of night air lingers, necessitating layers during these predawn hours, yet the promise of warmth suggests shedding some as the sun ascends to its zenith. A light jacket for now, peeled away later, seems prudent. This kind of weather, clear and inviting, beckons you to open spaces. Consider a serene stroll in the early glow, cradled in tranquility. You might wander through the quiet streets or find yourself gravitating towards the delicate embrace of the morning sun with a coffee in hand. Embrace the day slowly, tenderly, with a book that echoes the spirit of simplicity or a conversation with someone who shares your pace, all while life resumes its gentle rhythm against a backdrop of clear skies.",
