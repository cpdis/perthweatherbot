    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning begins with a gentle clarity, the sun breaking softly through a veil of thin clouds that dance playfully in the cool early light. This tranquil scene is punctuated by a breath of that characteristic northwest wind, whispering promises of an easy afternoon. The temperature, a comforting chill, nudges up to a high around sixty, yet one might find themselves favoring layers as the breeze carries hints of the ocean, warming and cooling in turn. \n\nAs day transitions into night, the sky will cradle the stars behind drifting clouds, working in concert with the forthcoming fog that will roll in quietly, cloaking the city in mystery. It\u2019s a lovely day for a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering bay mirrors the tranquil sky, or perhaps a visit to one of the city\u2019s quieter caf\u00e9s, where the aromas of fresh pastries can be enjoyed while watching the world drift by. Dressing in layers, with a light jacket or sweater, ensures comfort as the temperature dips into the evening's embrace.",
