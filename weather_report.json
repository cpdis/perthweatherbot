    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is quilted with cloud that smothers the stars and hushes the streets, a cool, gentle night with the sort of dimness that makes colors retreat. UV is negligible now. Toward dawn the overcast looks set to linger, so expect a grey, muffled sunrise and a soft, low-contrast morning; sunshine, if it appears, will come in shy breaks. UV will stay low early, then climb quickly if the ceiling thins, as spring here has a habit of flipping the switch by late morning.\n\nDress in easy layers\u2014a breathable shirt with a light sweater or jacket\u2014and keep sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen handy for later just in case. It\u2019s a good window for an unhurried coffee run, a quiet lap of the oval, or a bit of gentle pottering in the garden while the light is kind; save the longer outdoor errands for late morning if the sky opens, or linger over a book at the library and let the day decide for you.",
