    "weather_report": "Osborne Park wakes under a clean, cloudless blue, the kind of clear that sharpens edges and throws confident shadows. The forecast holds that line through late morning and early afternoon, so expect a bright, uncomplicated day, warming quickly. UV will be very high as the sun climbs, the light turning insistent by midday; the air feels dry and visibility is crisp, with only the promise of a modest sea breeze later to soften it. It\u2019s pleasant now, edging toward fierce around lunchtime.\n\nDress lightly and sensibly: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a generous sweep of sunscreen; carry water if you\u2019re on the move. This morning is made for small, contented things\u2014hanging a wash that will dry in no time, a coffee on the shaded side of the veranda, a quick errand on foot while the light is still kind. Around lunch, choose the cool side of the street or a seat beneath a tree in a nearby park. Save the unhurried stroll by Lake Monger or a quiet bit of balcony gardening for when the breeze begins to whisper in the afternoon.",
