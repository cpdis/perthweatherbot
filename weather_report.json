    "weather_report": "Morning in Mascot opens with a diluted, silvery light and a sky that seems to be thinking about rain. Sunshine will be fleeting, the day tending toward a grey, soft-focus clarity with light showers likely drifting in from mid to late afternoon and lingering toward evening. Even so, it\u2019s December; the UV can still bite when the cloud thins around midday, so a hat and sunscreen are sensible companions. The air feels on the mild side of warm, a touch humid rather than crisp, more gentle than bracing.\n\nDress in breathable layers and shoes that won\u2019t complain about damp footpaths; tuck a compact umbrella or light rain shell in your bag. It\u2019s a good day for a late-morning errand run or a quiet loop through the neighborhood before the sprinkles arrive, then something unhurried under a roof: a browse at the library, a tidy of the workspace, or a simple lunch somewhere with a window where you can watch the showers come and go. If you\u2019re commuting later, give the streets a few extra minutes; they\u2019ll be slick and reflective, holding the day\u2019s pale light.",
