    "weather_report": "In the stillness before dawn, Downtown San Francisco awakens under a blanket of clarity that promises a day of vibrant sunshine. Currently resting in the cool embrace of 46 degrees, the air is fresh, stirred lightly by a gentle north-northwest breeze. As day breaks, expect the sun to rise triumphantly, nudging the temperature up to a mild 59 degrees by midday. It will then retreat slightly, settling around 56 as afternoon shadows stretch across the city.\n\nThe forecast speaks of a splendid day, unmarred by fog or the usual marine layer that rolls in from the bay. Instead, a canvas of deep blue awaits, adorned by the occasional whisper of white clouds. Ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a contemplative moment in one of the city\u2019s quaint parks, the day invites explorations that are both enriching and serene. For attire, a light jacket layered over a comfortable shirt will suffice as the rays of the sun slowly warm the air, making the chill of the morning feel like an afterthought. Engage with the urban pace, embrace the whimsy of exploration, or find a quiet corner to sip coffee while watching the world unfurl around you.",
