    "weather_report": "Late afternoon on Rottnest feels rinsed clean: a clear sky, sun laying a mellow sheen over sea and sand, air steady and uncomplicated. It has been a bright, sun-forward day and remains so into early evening, though the light is softening and the UV is ebbing from earlier, likely moderate levels to something gentler; the glare off the water still asks for sunglasses now, but sunscreen can soon retreat to the bag. Visibility is crisp, colors are honest, and the breeze, if it stirs, simply tidies the edges.\n\nExpect the evening to stay cloudless and serene, with a comfortable coolness settling after sunset. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light shirt for the last golden hour and a cardigan or windbreaker for when the warmth slips away. Good hours for unhurried things: a shoreline wander with long shadows, a quiet perch on a bench to watch the ferry wakes unspool, a leisurely spin to a sheltered cove, or an early dinner outdoors, letting the sky do its slow, amber work.",
