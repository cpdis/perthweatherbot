    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the atmosphere greets you with sunshine, casting a gentle warmth over the city. The brilliance of blue stretches wide, unfurling across the sky, unmarred by any fog or haze. The iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge stands proudly against this backdrop, a reminder of the city\u2019s charm. Temperatures hover around the mid-fifties, a crisp yet pleasant chill that invites a snug layering of fabric\u2014a light sweater atop a long-sleeve shirt would feel just right. This is a day meant for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while watching the world move by.\n\nAs evening approaches, the weather promises to remain mild, with a soothing clarity to the night. The south wind, gentle and whispering, will accompany you as you make your way home, perhaps after a simple dinner with friends. Whether you choose to bask in the golden glow of the setting sun or sit in contemplation, this day embodies a rare San Francisco delight: calm and clarity, before the night cools down to a tranquil forty-three degrees.",
