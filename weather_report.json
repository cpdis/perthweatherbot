    "weather_report": "As the late evening unfolds in Subiaco, the sky has traded the fiery hues of sunset for a canopy brimming with stars, stretching across a serenely clear horizon. The air is crisp, carrying whispers of the waning day, and the lingering warmth provides a gentle reminder of the sun's earlier embrace. Today was a quintessential spring day, with sunlight that wrapped around everything with a golden glow, leaving shadows short and deep. The UV index, now irrelevant under the twilight, had earlier climbed high enough to warrant a respectful nod toward sunscreen. As the night deepens, the allure of the outdoors remains, albeit in a more subdued form. It is a perfect evening to dust off a light jacket and stroll down a quiet street, where polite clusters of laughter emanate from boulevard caf\u00e9s. Perhaps a gentle walk along the sheepish quiet paths of an evening park, adjusted to the pace set by the introspection that dim light encourages. These activities seem to suit the remaining hours while the hum of a lingering day slowly shades into a leisurely night.",
