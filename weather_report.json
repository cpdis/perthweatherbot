    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the streets feel rinsed and reflective, the air carrying the soft percussion of light rain that drifts through the early hours. Clouds hang in layered greys, keeping the stars at bay and promising a muted sunrise. It won\u2019t be very sunny to start; the UV is low now and should only lift to something moderate if the sky rips open in places later on. Visibility is steady, if a little gauzy around the edges, and the world has that calm, click-quiet sound you only hear before the birds fully commit to morning.\n\nAs the day stirs, broken cloud looks set to take over, giving way to occasional shafts of pale light and a more companionable mood. Expect a cool, slightly damp feel that becomes more pleasant as the paving dries. Dress in light layers with a compact rain shell; shoes that don\u2019t mind a puddle now and then, sunglasses in the pocket for when the sun makes its brief cameos. Good moments today are simple ones: an unhurried coffee beneath an awning while the shower passes, the grocery run saved for mid-morning when the light softens, a quiet loop through the park once the leaves stop dripping.",
