    "weather_report": "As the night deepens around Downtown San Francisco, a shroud of clouds blankets the city, hinting at the possibility of rain. The air hangs cool, with a gentle south wind whispering through the streets, all under a mostly cloudy sky where the faintest shimmer of stars can barely peek through. The temperature lingers around 52, making it a night best suited for a light jacket or a cozy sweater, ideal for a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero, where the lights dance on the water's surface and the sound of waves provides a serene soundtrack.\n\nLooking toward Tuesday, expect a continuation of the cloud cover with a chance of rain persisting throughout the day. The high will straddle the upper 50s, nudging downwards into the mid-50s as the afternoon progresses, so layers are recommended \u2014 a warm scarf or a stylish hat could add comfort against the cool breeze. As the morning unfolds, one might find solace in a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, steamy brews accompanying the rustling of newspapers, or perhaps a wandering visit through the eclectic shops of the Mission District. The marine layer will likely roll in near the bay, softly enrobing the Golden Gate Bridge in its familiar mist, perfect for those who appreciate the mysterious charm of fog-drenched views. Though the sky may be gray, the heart of the city beats with vibrant life, ready to embrace the day's adventures.",
