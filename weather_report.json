    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a clean, polished sky and the last warmth slipping into a calm, lucid night. Visibility is crisp, stars are likely to show, and the sun\u2019s bite is gone; UV is negligible now. It feels pleasantly quiet, a touch on the cool side, the sort of air that makes you breathe a little deeper.\n\nThe forecast keeps it clear late tonight and into the small hours, so expect a dry, uncomplicated night. A light jacket or cardigan over a tee will suit a short errand or an unhurried stroll; if you\u2019re out early tomorrow, the bright sun will reassert itself under a bare sky and UV will climb quickly, so think hat and sunscreen. Good conditions for ordinary rituals: water the pots, sort tomorrow\u2019s list by an open window, take the long way home under the clear dome and let the day idle to a gentle close.",
