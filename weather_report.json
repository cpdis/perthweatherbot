    "weather_report": "As twilight cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a slight chill, hinting at the rain that is expected to sweep through the city. The sky, mostly obscured by a veil of clouds, offers an occasional glimpse of the fading light, signaling a transition towards a night that feels fresh and damp. The forecast suggests a sporadic dance of drizzle and light rain, perhaps alluring a few curious souls to venture outdoors beneath umbrellas or raincoats. With temperatures settling around 54 degrees, it\u2019s wise to don something warm yet breathable; layers would prove a wise choice against the whispering winds that gust from the south.\n\nAs Sunday unfolds, the promise of rain showers lingers, particularly before the afternoon beckons. While this may discourage long strolls along the waterfront, a cozy caf\u00e9 with large windows might provide an enchanting backdrop for people-watching, as gray clouds grace the skyline. Alternatively, exploring the eclectic shops and art galleries tucked within the heart of the city could lead to delightful discoveries. There\u2019s a certain charm to San Francisco in such weather, where every raindrop becomes part of the picturesque mosaic of the city, inviting moments of contemplation and creativity. Whether it\u2019s the aroma of coffee or the warmth of conversation, this rainy Sunday can still offer pleasures unique to the city\u2019s vibrant spirit.",
