    "weather_report": "As the evening ushers in its calm embrace, Downtown San Francisco glimmers under a deepening twilight. The air is delightfully crisp, with the clear skies offering a brief reprieve from the heaviest blanket of fog that often shrouds the city in layers of gray. Tonight's gentle breeze, barely stirring at 0 to 7 mph, carries the scent of salt and the promise of a brisk January night, with temperatures settling around a cool 44 degrees.\n\nLooking ahead to M.L. King Jr. Day, the sun will paint the city in warm shades of gold and dappled light. With highs reaching near 60, it's a day where warmth rustles through easily accessible corners and local parks. The northeast wind, brisk and confident at 6 to 15 mph, will whip through those open spaces, but will likely offer a refreshing relief against the day\u2019s warmth. As you plan your Dress Code, consider layered comforts: a light sweater paired with a windbreaker will suit the day beautifully. \n\nWith the sun's rays expected to brighten the day, it's a perfect invitation for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a calming visit to one of the beloved local museums. Witness the sublime interaction of light with water and the inviting hum of the city coming alive, heralding the mingling of culture and nature on this magnificent weekend.",
