    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun drifts lazily over Subiaco, the delicate dance of scattered clouds graces the canvas of the sky, teasing with the promise of intermittent shafts of golden light. This presents a scene neither fully basking in the sun's warmth nor wrapped in the cool cocoon of shade, a day caught between moods. The day rouses a splendid equilibrium of clarity and mystery, a perfect background for contemplative walks or quiet readings on a sun-dappled patio. The UV index, though likely moderate with such cloud coverage, still advises a gentle reminder to wear a sun hat or light scarf\u2014elegant nods to both fashion and caution. \n\nThe air hovers with a refreshing coolness that invites a comfortably layered ensemble; think of a gentle cotton shirt slightly giving way to a thin cardigan or perhaps a casual jacket. The afternoon, enveloped in a warm subtlety, invites you to pause, to meander through Subiaco's quaint streets, feeling the earth beneath you, rhythmic footsteps narrating a timeless journey. A local caf\u00e9 offers an escape where you'll find comfort in a steaming cup of tea, watching the world unfurl through large glass panes. Or perhaps the call of the wild beckons, urging for a leisurely stroll through nearby trails, the flora and fauna providing a symphony of tranquility harmonizing with the sky's open, yet fragmented, embrace.",
