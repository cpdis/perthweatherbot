    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Rottnest with a low lid of cloud and a cool, salty breath off the water. Light rain drifts in from late evening and lingers past midnight, the soft, silvery kind that dulls footprints and hushes the jetty. Sunshine is finished for the day; the UV index is negligible now and will stay that way until morning. Expect a muted, slightly hazy night with damp paths and a gentle rattle in the rigging, visibility fair but softened by passing showers.\n\nIt\u2019s pleasant enough if you\u2019re dressed for it: a light waterproof over easy layers, closed shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and a hood instead of a hat. Leave the sunscreen; bring a small torch. This is a night for unhurried things\u2014an early wander around Thomson Bay between showers, sitting under a veranda to watch moorings rock, a bit of bike-chain tinkering and planning tomorrow\u2019s loop, or a quiet game of cards while the rain taps the windows. If you need a breath of air, take a short shoreline stroll and let the squalls slide by; the island feels thoughtfully hushed in weather like this.",
