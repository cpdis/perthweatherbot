    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a patchwork sky at this late hour, scattered clouds moving lazily enough to let a few stars wink through. The night feels gentle rather than cold, streetlights softened by drifting cover; it\u2019s quiet, with visibility good but edges blurred, as if the town has exhaled. UV is negligible now, of course, and the air carries that clean, after-hours clarity you only hear when the traffic thins.\n\nToward dawn, clouds are likely to thicken into a broken deck, which means a muted morning with brief, silvery breaks of sun rather than a blaze. Once the sun is up, the UV will climb quickly even through gaps in the cloud, so plan on sunscreen and a hat if you\u2019ll be out later; for now and early morning, light layers and comfortable shoes suit the mood. It looks like a pleasantly ordinary day ahead\u2014good for an early walk before the light hardens, a quiet caf\u00e9 breakfast by the window, or ticking off errands while the sky stays soft. If you\u2019re awake now, make tea, read a few pages, lay out tomorrow\u2019s outfit, and let the hush do its unhurried work.",
