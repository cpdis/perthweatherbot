    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a muted landscape greets us beneath an overcast sky that drapes the city like a soft, gray blanket. The afternoon air carries a chill, with temperatures hovering around the low 50s, giving an early whisper of rain that will become more insistent as the day progresses. A brisk wind from the west nudges through the streets, enticing the loose leaves to dance while reminding us of the stormy invitation just beyond the horizon. The chance of rain looms at a steady 60%, suggesting a cozy indoor retreat rather than strolls along the waterfront.\n\nAs night approaches, the promise of rain is poised to transform the city into a tapestry of glistening streets. With a steady low of 43 degrees, the evening will see a slight rise in warmth, yet the need for layers remains paramount. A comfortable jacket, perhaps a soft scarf tucked away, might serve well against the chill. Those lucky enough to have the warm glow of a caf\u00e9 nearby will find solace in a warm drink, while others might consider a leisurely evening stroll beneath the shelter of an umbrella, discovering the understated beauty that evening rain brings to San Francisco's iconic structures. It is a day that invites simplicity\u2014a moment to pause, savor each sip of warmth, and share quiet conversations as the city readies for the night ahead.",
