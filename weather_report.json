    "weather_report": "Before sunrise the island sits in a blue hush, with scattered cloud drifting like torn pages, promising a soft, streaked dawn rather than a hard, cloudless glare. Expect a mostly bright day with patches of shade slipping through; the sun should assert itself after breakfast, and while the UV is low now, it will rise to moderate or even high by late morning, so plan on sunscreen and sunglasses once the light sharpens. The air will feel cool at first, then pleasantly mild, the kind of clarity that makes distances seem closer and colors a little truer. Dress in easy layers with a light windbreaker, and pocket a hat for later. It\u2019s a good morning for ordinary, satisfying errands of leisure: a quiet ride along the salt lakes before the day gathers pace, coffee by the water while the light ripples into silver, a slow beachcombing circuit where the tide has written its overnight ledger, or a sketchbook moment on a bench while ferries stitch their lines across the bay.",
