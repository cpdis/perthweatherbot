The sky is a patchwork of partly sunny intervals, hinting at a day that will shift from crisp, blue expanses to a curtain of clouds. By afternoon, temperatures will slightly retreat, inviting the residents into the comfort of their jackets. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the air will grow heavier with the promise of rain. A 90% chance indicates that by late evening, the city will be enveloped in a gentle patter, urging folks homeward as they navigate slick sidewalks. The southeast breeze carries the faint scent of moisture, settling the marine layer close to the ground, yet this fog does little to diminish the grace of the Golden Gate or the iconic skyline. For those stepping outside, a layered ensemble will best accommodate the shifting elements\u2014light sweaters, waterproof jackets, and a sturdy umbrella as trusted companions. Perhaps, in between the showers, a cozy caf\u00e9 beckons, where one might sip a warm drink and watch the dance of clouds over the ever-vibrant streets, as the city winds down with a touch of rain-kissed magic.",
