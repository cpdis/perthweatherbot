    "weather_report": "As the evening envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air cools gently, suggesting a nocturnal tranquility. The forecast indicates clear skies, which are confirmed by the calm, unobstructed view of the stars above, punctuated by the serene city lights below. With temperatures dipping into the low 40s, the crisp air carries a subtle bite, inviting layers for warmth. A north northwest breeze whispers through the streets, light and unassuming, providing a pleasant backdrop for a leisurely stroll or for those seeking solace in the quiet hum of the city.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Sunday, a golden sun promises to bathe the city in its glow, though temperatures will peak in the mid-50s. The clarity of the day beckons outdoor adventures, whether it's a morning walk to savor the lingering freshness or a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit to indulge in warm pastries while soaking up the sunshine. Dress comfortably, perhaps in a cozy sweater or light jacket, as the drop in temperature towards late afternoon might suggest extra layers. In this inviting atmosphere, finding a spot to enjoy the scenery or catching up with a friend in an outdoor space sounds perfect for the day ahead, making the most of the delightful, albeit brisk, San Francisco winter.",
