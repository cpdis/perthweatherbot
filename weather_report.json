    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Osborne Park, the sky is clean and uncomplicated, the kind of clear that makes the night feel taller and the streets unhurried. Air sits on the cool side of comfortable, and visibility is crisp; the UV is essentially asleep for now, leaving only a gentle quiet and the promise of an easy pre-dawn.\n\nWith clear skies rolling toward first light, expect a bright, simple morning with plenty of sun once it clears the rooftops. UV will wake quickly after sunrise and turn assertive by late morning, so plan on sunscreen and a brimmed hat if you\u2019re out and about. Light layers suit the moment: a soft jumper for the early chill over a tee you\u2019ll want by mid-morning. It looks like a pleasant, low-drama day\u2014good for a slow walk at first light, coffee by an open window, watering the garden, or getting errands done before the glare sharpens. If you\u2019re up late, a quiet read with the window cracked will do; if you\u2019re turning in, leave the blinds ajar and let the dawn do the waking.",
