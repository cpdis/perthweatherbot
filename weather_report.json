    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, a shroud of rain quietly approaches, promising a wet embrace before dawn. The sky, draped in muted clouds, hints at the storm brewing in the distance. With temperatures hovering around the low fifties, there is a chill that whispers for warmth. Tonight\u2019s breeze carries a fine promise of rain, its gusts strong enough to sway the trees and whisk away the calm\u2014a notable 29 mph at its peak. Those wandering through the streets may want to don sturdy waterproof jackets, for the chance of precipitation looms large, and any uncovered apparel will soon be rendered soaked.\n\nAs the sun rises on Wednesday, it graces the city with a stubborn, cloudy facade. The rain will persist, transitioning the day into a drizzly twilight, with temperatures gently descending into the coolness of the early afternoon. The winds will remain brisk, nudging against the layers you\u2019ve chosen to wear. Given the atmosphere, this isn't a day for grand adventures outdoors but instead a moment for quiet reflection. Consider wrapping up in a comfortable corner caf\u00e9, cradling a steaming cup of coffee while the world beyond your window dances with droplets. Alternatively, a gentle stroll with a well-placed umbrella could reveal the city\u2019s character, even shrouded in gray.",
