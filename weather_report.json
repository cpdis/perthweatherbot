Expect a lucid, high-contrast light for the next couple of hours, softening as the cloud builds. The sun has some bite now; UV is likely very high for early afternoon in November, easing as the angle lowers toward late afternoon, so shade and sunscreen will be your friends.\n\nIt looks like an easy, pleasant day if you dress light: breathable shirt, hat, sunglasses, and a dab of sunscreen; a thin extra layer might be welcome after sunset if the air turns a touch cooler. Good hours for ordinary pleasures\u2014an unhurried loop along the foreshore, a coffee beneath an awning, hanging a wash to dry, or picking up a few groceries on foot while the light is still bright. As the clouds gather later, the glare should mellow, making it a fine time to sit with a book on a bench and watch the river traffic slide by.",
