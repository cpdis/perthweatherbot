    "weather_report": "Subiaco is under a clean, starry canopy just past midnight, the kind of clear, untroubled sky that makes the streets feel wider and the air unhurried. The forecast keeps the clouds at bay into the pre\u2011dawn hours, so expect a crisp, lucid start to the morning with the first light sliding in without obstruction and the day likely opening bright and dry.\n\nIf that clarity holds, the sun will be assertive soon after sunrise and the UV will ramp up quickly, as it does in December here\u2014plan for shade, sunscreen, and a brimmed hat by late morning. For now, a light layer is enough; by day, think airy fabrics, sunglasses, and a bottle of water. It looks like a pleasant day bookended by gentle edges: a fine window for an early walk before breakfast, watering the garden while the shadows are long, or a quiet errand run before the noon glare. By midday, give yourself to the cool side of the street and let the afternoon pass in the refuge of a caf\u00e9 nook or a shaded desk near an open window.",
