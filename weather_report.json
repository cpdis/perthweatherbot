    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, the fog drapes the city like a delicate veil, hinting at the atmospheric shifts that lie ahead. The twilight casts a muted glow upon the streets, with an air that feels soft yet bracing, a prelude to the rain that is destined to deliver itself around dawn. Tonight, expect the clouds to thicken, obscuring the stars and bringing with them a chill that tugs at your collar, inviting you to seek coziness against the evening's cool embrace. Temperatures are edged low, slipping to around 47 degrees, accompanied by gentle winds that whisper through the alleys.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, raindrops will likely begin to tap softly against the windows before the sun, obscured by clouds, has had a chance to fully rise. The high will barely flirt with 57 degrees, rendering the day on the cooler side, especially as the afternoon settles in. With the prospect of rain, layering becomes essential\u2014opt for a lightweight, water-resistant jacket and perhaps a scarf to ward off the bite of the chill. In terms of the day\u2019s agenda, consider a stroll through a local caf\u00e9 for a rich cup of coffee, where the smell of freshly brewed beans intermingles with the muted drumming of rain outside. Alternatively, curling up with a good book by the window can transform the day into a comforting retreat, as the sound of rain creates a soothing backdrop to your afternoon.",
