    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a flawless blue, the kind of clear that sharpens edges and shortens shadows. By midmorning the sun is already assertive, and the day promises to stay cloudless into the afternoon. Expect a very sunny stretch with strong, fast-rising UV; it will feel bright and increasingly warm, the air crisp with that clean, golden clarity that makes colors pop and thoughts go light. The breeze, if it stirs, will be a polite companion rather than a rescuer.\n\nDress for lightness and shade: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and generous sunscreen. Carry water and let your plans ride the arc of the sun\u2014finish errands and a gentle walk before noon, then retreat to a cool caf\u00e9, a quiet gallery, or a library corner when the glare peaks. It\u2019s a day for simple pleasures: hanging fresh laundry that will dry in no time, tending a few plants, or a short pedal to pick up bread and fruit. As the afternoon mellows, a seat under a tree or on a shady veranda will feel like a small reward.",
