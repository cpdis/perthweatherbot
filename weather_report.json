    "weather_report": "Denmark wakes under a soft, unwavering lid of cloud, the morning light diffused to a gentle pewter. Forecasts keep the sky overcast through the morning hours with little sign of breaks, so sunshine will be scarce and the UV index low, the sort of day where sunglasses stay in the drawer and colors look quietly washed. The air will feel settled rather than sparkling, a day of even, flat light and softened horizons.\n\nIt looks more contemplative than sparklingly pleasant, but comfortable enough if you dress for it: light layers, a sweater or wind-resistant jacket, and shoes you don\u2019t mind taking on damp pavements. Without rain in the forecast, an umbrella is optional, though a compact one in a bag never hurts. This is a morning for unhurried errands, a trip to the market, a museum wander, or a slow spin on the bicycle with lights on. If you\u2019re staying in, put the kettle on and work by a window; if you head out later, expect the gray to linger and plan something that suits a calm, muted day.",
