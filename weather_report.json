    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a bright yet tempered glow over Downtown San Francisco, a beacon of clarity in a city often shrouded in mystery. With a gentle north-northeast breeze rustling through the streets, the temperature hovers close to a cool 60 degrees, an invitation for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a thoughtful pause in a hidden caf\u00e9. As the afternoon deepens, that warmth gives way to a slight chill, dropping gradually to around 58 degrees, hinting at the day's transition towards night.\n\nAs darkness blankets the city, a crispness will settle, ushering in clear skies and a low near 46 degrees. The southwest winds lull gently, a whisper that encourages a cozy layer or two against the evening air. It's an ideal time to explore the quiet beauty of the city, perhaps wandering through the charming alleys of North Beach, breathing in the aromas from nearby kitchens. Generously layered in comfortable attire, you might find solace in a warm drink while watching the lights of the city twinkle against the backdrop of an indigo sky, the serenity punctuated only by the distant hum of late-night adventures unfolding.",
