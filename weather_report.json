    "weather_report": "Morning in Fremantle arrives under a pewter sky, the sea breeze carrying the smell of wet salt and eucalyptus as light rain noses in before lunch and thickens through the afternoon. Sunshine will be scarce, a muted glow at best, with the UV kept modest by the cloud deck, though a brief thinning around midday could still nip the unwary. The air feels clean but hazy at the edges; showers will soften the horizon and leave the streets shining like fish scales. It\u2019s a gentle, grey day rather than a harsh one, and the world seems to speak in lowered voices.\n\nDress in light layers with a waterproof shell and shoes you don\u2019t mind getting damp; pack a small umbrella for the busier bursts. If you\u2019re headed out now, enjoy a slow lap of the foreshore between showers, then duck into a bookshop or the markets and let the rain drum on the roof while you browse. Later, errands close to home, a late morning coffee with a window seat, or a tidy-up of neglected drawers will fit the mood. If the clouds briefly lift, take five minutes on the verandah, face to the pale sun, then let the curtain of rain close again.",
