    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a bright sun, casting a gentle warmth over the city. The temperatures hover around a comfortable 68 degrees, gradually nudging down to about 63 as the day draws on. With a calm breeze coming from the west northwest at just 7 mph, the air carries a sense of clarity, unmarred by any haze or fog that typically might whisper off the bay. The iconic hills and structures stand stark against a pristine blue sky, inviting exploration and the chance to marvel at the vibrant life bustling below.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will remain clear, with a low settling close to 51 degrees, softened by a light south southwest wind. This mild evening offers a pleasant opportunity to stroll through the city's diverse neighborhoods or visit a cozy caf\u00e9. Light layers would be wise for those venturing out, perhaps a light jacket to embrace the refreshing evening air while enjoying a leisurely walk or engaging in conversation on a city terrace. It\u2019s a day that encapsulates the charm of San Francisco, subtly alluring as it beckons those within its embrace to find joy in the everyday.",
