With temperatures gently dipping toward the cool mid-forties, a light southeast wind carries whispers of a night that promises to be crisp but invigorating. There is an absence of the typical fog that can cloak the Bay Area, allowing for unobstructed views and a serenity that often invites contemplation.\n\nTomorrow morning will greet the city with a sunny panorama, brightening the landscape and lifting spirits with a high near sixty, before shifting to a cooler 57 in the afternoon as the sun\u2019s warmth retreats. The northeast winds may tease the hair on your neck, bringing with them an energy that feels alive against the blue sky.
