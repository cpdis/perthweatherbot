    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a persistent rain has begun to taper off before dawn. The air is thick with humidity, carrying the scent of wet pavement and hinting at the day's potential for clarity. With temperatures lingering in the low fifties, the chill is enough to warrant a light jacket, perhaps one layered with a soft sweater beneath for extra warmth against the gentle west wind that whispers through the city, occasionally gusting with a playful intensity.\n\nThursday promises a transformation, as the sun breaks through the clouds, offering golden light to a landscape that will soon shed the remnants of rain. With a high around sixty-two, the afternoon brings a gentle cooling, a reminder of the ocean's breath just beyond the hills. Though the early hours may hold onto a marine layer, the forecast hints at a clearer day ahead, allowing for wide views and warmth from the sun's rays. For those contemplating how to engage with this evolving scene, a stroll through one of the city\u2019s many parks, or perhaps a leisurely coffee on an outdoor patio, could be an ideal way to embrace the day's pleasantly crisp embrace while wearing something comfortable yet warm.",
