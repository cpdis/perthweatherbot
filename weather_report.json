    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco awakens beneath a veil of patchy fog, its familiar landmarks shrouded in a soft, damp embrace. The morning's light struggles to break through the low-hanging clouds, casting a muted glow over the city. For now, the air carries a hint of rain, a reminder of the potential showers that might grace the streets before the day fully unfolds. As the morning matures, expect the fog to linger, particularly in the more sheltered nooks of the Bay. The chill will gently rise but remain a cool companion, hovering around the mid-fifties, inviting a light jacket or sweater to ward off the early bite in the air.\n\nTonight offers a reprieve from the moisture, bringing a clearer sky but a crispness that speaks of impending winter nights. As the temperature drops towards the mid-forties, a cozy scarf and a heavier jacket will serve well to retain warmth during evening strolls. Given the conditions, a leisurely morning might be best spent savoring a warm cup of coffee in a nearby caf\u00e9, perhaps watching the city awaken from its foggy slumber. As the day goes on, the persistent fog pairs well with a stroll through the quieter streets\u2014ideal for indulging in a bit of solitude or finding inspiration in the city\u2019s more secluded corners. As dusk approaches, the promise of clarity will make for a serene twilight, perfect for group gatherings or reflective moments under an expansive darkening sky.",
