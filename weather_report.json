    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with a quilt of low cloud and the faint smell of rain in the air. The sun is long gone and the UV is essentially asleep; streetlights glow with soft halos, and the view down the block feels a touch blurred, as though seen through a lightly steamed window. It\u2019s cool rather than cold, the sort of evening that hushes traffic and makes footsteps sound closer than they are.\n\nLight showers are due to drift in late this evening and linger toward the small hours, more a persistent patter than a downpour. Expect a muted night rather than a sparkling one. A thin waterproof or a hooded shell and comfortable closed shoes will serve you well; an umbrella wouldn\u2019t be overcautious. Consider simple comforts: pick up something warm from a nearby caf\u00e9 before it closes, take the long way home under the shopfront awnings, sort the week\u2019s receipts at the kitchen table, or let the rain keep time while you draft tomorrow\u2019s list.",
