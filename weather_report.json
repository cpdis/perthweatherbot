    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the city emerges with a gentle embrace of cloud and serenity. The morning is partly sunny, with tendrils of fog lingering at the edges of awareness, hinting at the day's shift towards a more overcast disposition. The current temperature lingers in the cool range, inviting a thoughtful choice of layers. Light breezes whisper through the streets, carrying the promise of rain as night approaches.\n\nAs the hours advance, expect a steady transition; the bright hints of sunshine will yield to a thickening blanket of clouds, accompanied by the soft patter of rain beginning after 10 PM. The humidity rises, and any morning clarity will soon give way to a cozy, damp ambiance befitting a leisurely indoor day. Embrace this opportunity to gather with friends over coffee in a local caf\u00e9, perhaps venturing into an art gallery, where the warmth of creativity contrasts with the cooling air outside. For those out and about, a light jacket or cozy sweater, complemented by an umbrella, will serve well as the evening approaches, ensuring comfort in the shifting weather.",
