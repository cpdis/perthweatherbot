    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a subtle sense of anticipation stirs in the air, marked by the promise of rain that may touch the city before dawn. Presently, clouds drift lazily across the horizon, partly obscuring the moonlight, while a gentle wind whispers through the streets, carrying the coolness of the night along with it. With a current low temperature hovering around the upper forties, residents should consider layering a light jacket over their evening clothes, aiming for comfort while enjoying the scenic urban palette.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, the dawn is poised to unveil a refreshing sunny disposition that will wrap the city in warmth. The forecast hints at a gradual warming, peaking near sixty, before the afternoon ushers in cooler breezes. The day beckons for leisurely strolls through the city's iconic hills, perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a cup of artisan coffee, or a relaxed afternoon in a nearby park where the freshness of the air invigorates. While the sunsets over the Pacific, the chilly breeze may make an extra layer advisable as the golden hour converges with twilight.",
