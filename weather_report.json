    "weather_report": "The dawn settles softly over Downtown San Francisco, casting a veil of muted color that suggests the city's distinct charm. The atmosphere is characterized by a subtle haze, as the remnants of last night's marine layer linger in the higher elevations, cloaking the Golden Gate and the surrounding hills in an enigmatic embrace. As morning progresses, the sky gradually clears, revealing patches of blue, although the coastal fog is poised to return later, promising a drizzly evening under cloudy skies.\n\nToday's temperatures will hover around the low sixties, but don\u2019t be surprised if they dip into the fifty-something range by afternoon. With a mild south wind whisking through the streets, it feels both fresh and a tad brisk. Dress comfortably but prepare for a layer or two; a light jacket and perhaps a scarf would serve well against the oncoming drizzle set to sweep in after dark. The splashes of sun peeking through clouds invite a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely coffee break at your favorite caf\u00e9, perhaps tracing the contours of the sea while the world takes a moment to awaken. As the day rolls on, consider locating a cozy nook to settle in for the evening, where the sound of raindrops provides a gentle soundtrack to the city's heartbeat.",
