    "weather_report": "As twilight gently descends upon Subiaco, the faded shards of daylight recede on the backdrop of a sky grandly illustrated with splashes of scattered clouds. The celestial tableau, otherwise echoing nature's silhouettes, contains broken clouds that cradle the last vestiges of sunlight, melting away the serene light into the approaching embrace of evening. The setting sun reduces the visibility to intimate outlines, casting shrouded mystery into the day's remnants. \n\nWhispers of a mild chill linger in the air, an understated prelude and a stark contrast to today's otherwise easeful and pleasant demeanor. This evening, donned in a light sweater, perhaps, would be an ideal companion to your leisurely stroll, as the fabric intertwines with the cool whiff of the evening breeze. The remaining sunlight is nonintrusive; it allows for the comfortable indulgence of an alfresco reading or the simple, heartwarming joy of a shared gaze through a window pane, accompanied by a soothing cup of chamomile.",
