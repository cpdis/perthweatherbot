    "weather_report": "As the gentle embrace of night falls over Downtown San Francisco, a hush blankets the city, punctuated only by the distant hum of urban life. The air is crisp, a precursor to the patchy fog that will grace the early hours, veiling the city in a touch of mystery between four and five. A soft breeze brushes by, almost shy, from the north-northwest. With temperatures dipping to a cool 44 degrees, it would be wise to wrap up in layers\u2014perhaps a knit sweater beneath a light jacket to stave off the chill.\n\nCome morning, expect the sun to emerge triumphantly, casting warm golden hues across the bay and illuminating the iconic skyline. As the day unfolds, the temperatures will rise slightly to around 55, tapering back to a mellow 52 by afternoon. The fog will surrender to mostly sunny skies, allowing the city\u2019s vibrant character to shine through. For those looking to enjoy the day, a stroll through Golden Gate Park or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 could be most rewarding. An afternoon reading by the water's edge would be simply delightful, as the gentle breeze carries whispers of the waves, inviting tranquility into one\u2019s day.",
