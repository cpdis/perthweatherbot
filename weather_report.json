    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a flawless, inky sky; the last warmth has slipped away and the air feels tidy and unbothered. The forecast keeps the night clear through late evening and into the small hours, so there\u2019s no sun to speak of now and the UV is essentially asleep. It\u2019s a good night for unhurried breaths and unhurried steps, for stars that feel close and the hush of backyards.\n\nExpect the clarity to hold overnight; if these bare skies persist, dawn should break clean and bright, with UV rising quickly once the sun takes command. For now, a light layer will do for a short stroll or a quiet sit on the veranda, windows cracked if it\u2019s safe. In the morning, think breathable fabrics, a hat, and sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out and about. Tonight invites simple chores and small pleasures: take the dog around the block, water the pots, sort tomorrow\u2019s list, or savor a chapter before bed.",
