The current chill lingers around 42 degrees, inviting the kind of layered clothing that whispers comfort\u2014think a soft sweater under a light jacket. As the day unfolds, the forecast hints at a shift, nudging us toward a mix of sun and clouds, with a chance of rain ghosting in after the afternoon light begins to wane. \n\nWhile the cityscape is kissed by the muted glow of the urban night, a gentle breeze from the west-northwest carries a promise of change, though the thick blanket of fog typical of this coastal enclave keeps a low profile for now. With a high near 53 degrees beckoning, expect the serenity of the day to transition into a gray haze soon after, but proceed with casual plans: perhaps a leisurely stroll through one of the neighborhood parks or a quiet sit at a nearby caf\u00e9, where warmth can be found in both coffee and conversation. As the clouds flirt with the horizon and a potentially drizzly spell approaches, it\u2019s wise to keep an umbrella handy\u2014preparation transforms uncertainty into ease in this ever-enigmatic city.",
