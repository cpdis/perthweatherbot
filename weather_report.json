    "weather_report": "As dawn begins to break over Downtown San Francisco, a calmness envelops the city, the air crisp with the freshness that only the early morning can offer. Despite the serene skies overhead, a touch of humidity lingers, an indication of the rain that is expected to sweep in later today. Currently, the streets are mostly clear, illuminated by the faint glow of street lamps as the city stirs from its slumber. The temperature sits around a cool 48 degrees, inviting a light jacket or a cozy sweater for those stepping out into the vibrant early hours.\n\nMoving through the day, clouds will begin to gather, and by late morning, the gentle patter of rain will likely be a familiar soundtrack. As the temperature climbs a touch, expect a high around 59 before settling back into the low 50s in the afternoon. There might be brief moments of sun peeking through, but for the most part, a local marine layer may obscure distant views, reminding us that coastal weather is unpredictable. Given the forecast, a stroll through the city could be delightful, especially in the early hours before the rain arrives. Consider a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9, curling up with a book, sipping something warm, as the world outside becomes a canvas of muted colors beneath a veil of rain.",
