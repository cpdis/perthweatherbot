    "weather_report": "A cool, muted morning envelops Downtown San Francisco, where a blanket of clouds looms overhead, portending the rain set to sweep in later this afternoon. The chill in the air is palpable, reminding one that winter remains firmly here, with temperatures hovering around a brisk fifty-four degrees, kissed by a gentle east-southeast breeze. As you set out today, a sturdy jacket becomes essential, particularly as the clouds grow heavier and the promise of rain dances on the horizon. \n\nBy later in the day, expect the atmosphere to shift dramatically; the city, cloaked in a heavy layer of gray, will surrender to a steady downpour come four o'clock. With total precipitation likely reaching between two to three inches, it would be wise to keep an umbrella close at hand and seek shelter in inviting caf\u00e9s or cozy bookstores throughout the afternoon. The promise of this bountiful rain, while perhaps dampening outdoor plans, offers a perfect excuse to linger over a warm drink or lose oneself in the pages of a good book. For those with a penchant for adventure, the subtle, rhythmic sound of raindrops against the pavement beckons for a contemplative stroll along the fog-kissed waterfront, providing a unique beauty that only a rainy day can evoke.",
