    "weather_report": "A lucid Subiaco morning is unfolding, the sky rinsed clean and bright, with the forecast holding clear right through late morning and into early afternoon. Expect the sun to become assertive as midday approaches; UV will run high to very high under this unbroken blue, with sharp, tidy shadows and colours that look freshly painted. It should feel pleasant now, warming quickly, the sort of clarity that makes everything seem newly outlined and untroubled, with no whisper of rain.\n\nDress for ease and glare: light, breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; carry water if you\u2019re on foot. This is good weather for small, ordinary victories\u2014walk to a caf\u00e9 and claim a shaded table, hang a load of washing and watch it turn dry in a single song, run a quick bike errand while the streets are still unhurried, or give the balcony herbs a careful soak before the afternoon bite. If the light grows too fierce, step into the library or a quiet shop, then drift back out when the sun softens.",
