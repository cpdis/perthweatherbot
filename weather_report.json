    "weather_report": "Bend wakes under a quiet pre-dawn, the world pared down to silhouettes and a deep, breath-white chill. The forecast promises a clean, cloudless morning, and once the sun crests the rim the light will be bright and unfiltered, a winter-blue sky with that high-desert clarity that makes edges look newly sharpened. Expect genuine sunshine rather than warmth; the UV index stays low this time of year, but the glare can still nip at the eyes, so sunglasses are worth pocketing.\n\nDress in warm, comfortable layers\u2014hat, gloves, and something wind-resistant for the early hours\u2014then shed a layer as the light gathers strength. It\u2019s a day for simple, unrushed errands while the roads are bright, a brisk walk through the neighborhood to feel the sun on your face, or a quiet half-hour by a window with coffee and a book. If you\u2019re inclined to move, stretch the legs with an easy ride or tidy the garage with the door open to the blue, letting fresh air and sunlight do their small, reliable magic.",
