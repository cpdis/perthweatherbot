    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the evening unfolds with a gentle shift in atmosphere. The promise of a cool night hovers in the air, brushed by the faint whisper of a northwest breeze. Tonight\u2019s low near 45 degrees mimics the soft touch of a familiar blanket, inviting cozy layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a scarf to ward off the chill that dances through the streets. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, sunlight will bathe the city in warmth, though the day begins with a cool embrace. With temperatures reaching towards the mid-fifties, expect to feel the comfort of the sun breaking through the morning haze, but be prepared for a gradual drop in warmth by afternoon. Although the forecast leans towards clarity, the reality of San Francisco often carries the imprint of its iconic marine layer. A subtle fog may cradle the more distant vistas, reminding us that the city\u2019s charm often lies in its mysteries. It\u2019s an ideal day for a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or a quiet afternoon in a caf\u00e9, watching the world go by, and savoring the bittersweet beauty of the Bay Area as it melds into evening.",
