The night sky, partly obscured by clouds, reveals pinpricks of city lights twinkling like stars scattered across the vast darkness. The soft breeze whispers secrets from the north, as it dances through the streets, carrying with it the crispness of the bay. Tonight, the marine layer, though retreating, is just below the surface, hinting at a potentially fog-laden morning. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a warmth is set to envelop the city, with sunshine breaking through the clouds, bringing promises of clearer skies and highs around 63 degrees. As the day progresses, the cooler afternoon temperatures may tempt you to layer lightly\u2014a light jacket would suffice for the morning chill, transitioning to comfort as the sun rises higher. This is a day well-suited for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks, taking in the serene atmosphere painted by the sunny disposition. Whether sipping a steaming cup of coffee outside or reading a book beneath the sun, the conditions invite you to savor the subtle beauty of the city.",
