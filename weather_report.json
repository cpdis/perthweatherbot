    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a muted, midnight hush, the air cool and expectant as light rain drifts in toward the small hours and lingers toward dawn. The sky is closed for the night\u2014no sunshine to be had, and the UV index is negligible until after sunrise. Expect a soft, grey start to the day, streets a little slick, distant lights slightly blurred by a fine sheen of moisture. Clarity will be gentle rather than bright, the kind of morning that asks for patience and unhurried footsteps.\n\nDress with quiet pragmatism: a light waterproof or a trench, layers you can shed later if the clouds lift, closed shoes, and a compact umbrella. If you\u2019re up late, make a warm drink, finish a chapter, tidy the edges of tomorrow; if you\u2019re up early, leave a few extra minutes for a damp commute and let the drizzle set the tempo. Outdoor plans can wait for the sky to speak; any sunshine, if it appears, will likely be fleeting after the first act of rain.",
