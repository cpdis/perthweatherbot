The temperature drapes comfortably around 49, and a gentle whisper of wind from the south-southwest adds a touch of coolness. The forecast hints at a slight chance of drizzle in the early morning, but for now, the atmosphere is clear enough to appreciate the twinkling lights that punctuate the night. \n\nTomorrow promises a shift in focus as the sun breaks through, ushering in a mostly sunny disposition with a high near 60, before retreating to a cooler 56 in the afternoon. For those planning to embrace the day, a light jacket or layers would be prudent, keeping you cozy against the brisk breeze. With patches of sunshine expected, activities could flourish\u2014perhaps a quiet walk along the waterfront or a leisurely visit to one of the city's charming cafes, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the crisp air. As you navigate the cobbled streets, take a moment to gaze toward the horizon; the Golden Gate should stand proud, a steadfast sentinel as the city stirs to life with the promise of a new day.",
