    "weather_report": "As the sun graces the afternoon sky over Downtown San Francisco, a serene calmness prevails. The air is crisp, with temperatures gently hovering around the mid-fifties. You can sense a hint of the approaching chill that promises to envelop the city as the day unfolds. The sunlight, brightening the rooftops and streets below, lends a golden hue to the urban landscape, although fog clings stubbornly to the peripheries, particularly near the edges of the bay, marking a stark yet beautiful contrast between the illuminated city and the rolling mist.\n\nAs evening creeps in, prepare for rain as the clouds gather, heavy and foreboding, portending a wet night ahead. The forecast hints at a steady drizzle, likely arriving after dinner, bringing with it an atmosphere perfect for cozying up indoors. It\u2019s advisable to dress in layers\u2014a warm sweater paired with a light jacket, perhaps, so you can traverse the streets in comfort before the rain takes hold. The charm of the day lies in its fleeting moments; perhaps a leisurely stroll through a nearby park or an unhurried visit to a local caf\u00e9 is in order before the sky opens up. Enjoy the fleeting clarity while it lasts, for soon enough, the soothing sound of rain will serenade the evening, inviting warmth and relaxation indoors.",
