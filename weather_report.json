    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a steady blanket of clouds hovers, shrouding the city in muted hues of gray. The air carries a soft chill, typical for this time of year, with a low settling around fifty-four degrees. This evening may invite occasional drizzle, teasing the boundaries of rain, but nothing too substantial is expected. It's a time when the wind whispers gently through the streets\u2014southwest gusts swirling at a comfortable pace, making it a night for light layering to combat the briskness.\n\nTomorrow, the city awakens to a higher probability of rain, especially before the afternoon. With the temperatures falling from a mild high of fifty-eight, a heavier coat or a waterproof jacket might be wise. These conditions suggest a day where gray skies dominate, accompanied by the sound of drops pattering against pavement, a soothing symphony for introspective walks or cozy afternoons indoors. Perhaps it\u2019s a fitting time for a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9, where steam rises from mugs, or a quiet exploration of the city's vibrant corners\u2014all wrapped in the gentle embrace of a raincoat and optimism.",
