    "weather_report": "As dawn gently unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp, a tantalizing dance between fresh and cool. The night sky gradually gives way to a day promised to be sunlit, with temperatures hovering just above the cool embrace of the night. The winds, whispering from the north northeast, carry the scent of the bay, crisp and invigorating, nudging awake the slumbering city. The day ahead, awash in clear skies, is set to warm to a comfortable 61 degrees, while the afternoon light slowly tugs the temperature down to a soothing 57. \n\nWith a lack of fog to obscure the city's iconic silhouette, the Golden Gate Bridge stands proud, its grandeur unmarred by any marine layer. This clarity invites exploration; a stroll along the Embarcadero could be a delightful way to embrace the refreshing air. Those planning outings should consider light layers; a cozy sweater thrown over a simple tee would suffice, as afternoons can weave a gentle chill into the fabric of the day. As the city comes alive, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 with a sun-drenched terrace offers the perfect opportunity for a moment of quiet reflection over a warm cup. The world is eager to awaken, and today promises to be a delightful embrace of clarity and calm.",
