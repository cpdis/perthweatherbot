    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into early afternoon under an open, polished sky, the kind that makes edges sharper and colors a shade braver. Forecasts keep the canvas clear through the afternoon and toward evening, so expect plenty of bright sun, crisp visibility, and a gentle cool lingering in the shade. UV sits in the moderate band for the next hour or two before softening, so sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen pair well with light layers\u2014a breathable shirt, a cardigan you can shrug off, perhaps a hat if you\u2019ll linger. It\u2019s a pleasant day for unhurried errands on foot, for airing the linen on the line, for a quiet lap through Kings Park or a coffee taken outdoors while the light stays honest and untroubled. As the sun drifts west, the heat won\u2019t press; the air will stay polite. Windows open, kettle on, maybe a small project at the table as the afternoon unspools.",
