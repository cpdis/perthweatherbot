    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into late afternoon beneath a rinsed, cloudless sky; the sun leans low and honey-colored, and the air feels clean and uncomplicated. It is distinctly sunny now, yet the bite of winter lingers at the edges, and the UV has slipped from its midday insistence to a kinder, low-to-moderate glow\u2014enough for sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019re fair, but not a siege. The evening ahead looks clear and tranquil, the kind of uncomplicated blue-to-amber fade that invites unhurried plans. Expect a quick cool-down after sunset; a light layer now and a proper jumper for later will keep the chill from nipping. This is a pleasant, open-faced sort of day: ideal for a gentle loop through the neighborhood, a pause on a sunlit bench, a tidy-up of balcony plants, or an early errand by foot before the shops close. As twilight gathers, consider a short cycle to catch the last golden seams along the rooftops, then home for something warm.",
