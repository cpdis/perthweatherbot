    "weather_report": "As the evening drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm envelops the city. The air is crisp, with temperatures dipping to around 45, punctuated by a soothing northwest breeze, making it a delightful evening for a quiet stroll along the waterfront or perhaps settling in with a good book at one of the cozy caf\u00e9s. Although the night is mostly clear, one may detect faint hints of fog gathering at the fringes of the Bay, teasing the horizon yet leaving the skyline bright and visible. \n\nCome morning, a symphony of sun will awaken the city. Expect a warm embrace from golden rays, with temperatures reaching a pleasant 60, gradually cooling in the afternoon. The low whisper of a northeast wind carries hints of freshness that beckons a light jacket, perfect for layering against the coolness of the early hours. With such inviting weather, a leisurely walk through the streets filled with life, perhaps visiting local shops or savoring a leisurely brunch, could be the quintessential way to bask in the day\u2019s glory.",
