    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the weather tells a story of muted hues and gentle melancholy, as a steady rain transforms the city into a canvas of reflections and glistening surfaces. With clouds hanging low, the temperatures hover around 55 degrees, gradually cooling to 53 as evening approaches. The air is thick with moisture, promising a generous downpour that could bring between one and two inches of rainfall, cloaking the Golden Gate in a veil of silvery mist. The winds are soft but might stir later, caressing the cheeks with a brisk air as they gust up to 48 mph. The chances of precipitation sit at a steadfast 100%, an unmistakable signal to make your plans with the drizzle in mind.\n\nGiven the gray embrace of the day, it\u2019s best to bundle up in a waterproof jacket and perhaps some sturdy footwear for splashing through puddles. An umbrella may offer momentary shelter, yet the winds could playfully snatch it away in gusts of whimsy. As you navigate the city, consider indulging in the simple pleasures of the indoors: perhaps revisiting that cozy caf\u00e9 hidden in a narrow alley, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with warm pastries, inviting you to linger for a while. If the artistic muse strikes, a quiet afternoon in a gallery could reveal new inspirations sheltered from the rain's lullaby.",
