    "weather_report": "Adelaide sits under a brushed-steel sky at midday, the light muted and gentle, as if the sun had pulled a sheer curtain across its face. Expect the afternoon to lean into light rain, first a polite sprinkle and then a steady hush toward evening; sunshine will be scarce, and the UV will stay low, more a whisper than a worry. The day has that softened clarity where edges blur a little and the hills look smudged in graphite, the kind of weather that quiets the streets and slows the heart-rate of the city. It feels cool rather than cold, damp rather than dour; a day made for unhurried errands and small comforts. Dress in layers with a light waterproof on top, comfortable shoes, and a compact umbrella tucked in your bag. If you\u2019re out, time a grocery run or library visit before the showers settle in; if you\u2019re staying put, make a pot of tea, clear a corner of the desk, and let the rain do the talking.",
