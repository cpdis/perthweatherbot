    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco feels hushed and softly dim, a low quilt of cloud pressed over the roofs. The night gives way without ceremony and the sky stays stubbornly grey; light rain is likely to drift in not long after sunrise. Sunshine will be scarce this morning and the UV gentle at first, held down by the cloud, though if there\u2019s the briefest bright break later it can rise quickly in spring. Expect a muted, slightly damp day with softened horizons and a quiet shine on pavements.\n\nDress for cool, misty air: a light waterproof or windbreaker, comfortable closed shoes, and something you won\u2019t mind brushing with a sprinkle of rain. Tuck a small umbrella in your bag; keep sunscreen handy just in case the lid lifts. It\u2019s a good morning for a slow coffee at a corner cafe, a grocery run between showers, or a wander to the library when it opens. If the drizzle lingers, let the day be practical and unhurried; if it eases, take a short walk under the jacarandas and listen to the neighborhood wake.",
