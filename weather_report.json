With temperatures tipping toward the mid-50s, you may find it necessary to shrug on a light sweater or a windbreaker as the day breathes its cool sigh. The expanse is largely clear, allowing the dotted skyline to unveil its full character, though hints of an encroaching marine layer whisper promises of rain as the night approaches. \n\nThe evening holds the potential for a well-deserved downpour, likely beginning in the early hours, with a predictably cozy low settling around 47 degrees. A soft southwest wind bears tidings of the coming precipitation, rolling in like a gentle wave\u2014not the kind that douses your spirit, but rather one that invites contemplation. As the clouds gather, consider a leisurely stroll through the nearby neighborhoods, perhaps indulging in a quiet caf\u00e9, enjoying a warm drink while you watch the world blur through the fog. The mood shifts, inviting introspection and connection more than vigor. Wrap yourself in layers, and let the cooler breeze carry you into the welcoming embrace of the city\u2019s hidden gems.",
