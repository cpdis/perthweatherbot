    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Perth feels open and uncomplicated: a pale-blue sky with just a scattering of clouds, the sun mellowing as it angles toward evening. Sunshine remains generous over the next few hours with only a few clouds to soften it, so visibility stays crisp and the day reads clear and inviting. UV will be easing with the dropping sun; if you\u2019re out before dusk, a hat and a touch of sunscreen still make sense, but the bite fades quickly into evening.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant finish to the day. Light, breathable layers are enough now, with a cardigan handy for when the warmth slips away after sunset. This is the hour for ordinary errands done on foot, a lazy circuit of the neighborhood, watering the garden, or carrying dinner out to the balcony to catch the last gold on the walls. As night arrives, expect a calm, mostly clear sky and a simple, comfortable close.",
