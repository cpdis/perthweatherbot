    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this Wednesday, the city lies beneath a thick shroud of clouds, with the eerie glow of urban lights softened by the encroaching darkness. A gentle whisper of rain is anticipated, mingling with the cool winds that sweep down from the southeast, hinting at the instability of the day ahead. As clouds blanket the sky, the temperature lingers around a brisk 52 degrees, and the promise of rain is both a harbinger of solace and a reminder of the unpredictable nature of the San Francisco fall.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect the clouds to thicken further, morphing into a steady downpour. With temperatures teetering between 57 and 59 degrees, the chill in the air nudges one to reach for a warm coat and perhaps a light scarf. The gusty winds may send chills as strong currents of air stir through the streets. Given this damp atmosphere, a stroll along the waterfront might reveal a quiet beauty\u2014the fog weaving through the structures, giving the city an ethereal quality. While some may seek refuge indoors, perhaps enjoy a leisurely morning coffee by the window, those daring enough to venture out might find solace in the rhythmic sound of rain\u2014a perfect backdrop for a contemplative day.",
