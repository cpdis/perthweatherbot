    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a whisper of cool air dances through the streets, bringing with it the promise of rainfall by dawn. Currently, the city rests under a cloak of mostly clear skies, though the hint of moisture lingers in the air, suggesting the delicate trace of clouds that may roll in later. The temperature edges down to a crisp 44 degrees, nudging upward just a touch as the night unfolds. With a soft wind from the west-northwest, all around is peaceful, save for the gentle sighing of distant waves.\n\nTomorrow paints a slightly more optimistic picture, with sunny intervals expected throughout the day. The sun will likely peek through, igniting the horizon with warmth that will peak around 54 degrees before the chill returns in the afternoon. As the day transitions, one might notice a touch of humidity creeping in, the air crisp but invigorating\u2014perfect for a jaunt on foot. It's advisable to don layers this time\u2014a cozy sweater alongside a light jacket\u2014catering to both the morning's briskness and the hopeful warmth of the afternoon. Perhaps wander through the quieter streets, savoring the early light as it filters through the buildings, or indulge in a leisurely coffee at a tucked-away caf\u00e9. Enjoying the city's slow rhythm on such a day is a modest pleasure well worth cherishing.",
