    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a palpable anticipation of change. The morning\u2019s sun lingers, a soft brightness illuminating the cityscape, yet the clouds\u2014thinning and pregnant with promise\u2014hint at rain that may roll in as the clock edges toward late afternoon. As temperatures hover around a brisk 59 degrees, a northwest wind whispers coolly, an invitation to wrap yourself snugly in layered attire. \n\nThe evening holds a more somber tale as the rain arrives, drenching the city beneath a blanket of gray. A steady deluge is on the horizon, with the possibility of a half to three-quarters of an inch saturating the urban sprawl by nightfall. As the sky darkens to a muted tapestry overhead, consider retreating indoors for warmth and comfort. Perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or a local bookstore would be ideal, allowing you to unwind while waiting for the weather to shift again. It's an opportunity to savor the moment, even as the clouds signal a definitive end to the day\u2019s fleeting sun.",
