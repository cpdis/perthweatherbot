    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean, lacquered blue, the kind of morning that sharpens edges and shortens shadows. The air feels amiable now, but the sun is already intent; with clear skies holding through late morning and into early afternoon, expect a bright, uncompromising light and a UV index that climbs quickly toward the fierce end of the scale. The day looks simple and honest: no cloud, high clarity, colours a touch over-saturated, the sort of sky that makes windows flash and pavements glow.\n\nDress light and breathable, favoring pale fabrics; a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen aren\u2019t accessories so much as good manners. Take your errands and a gentle walk before noon, perhaps a coffee run or a loop past the jacarandas while they\u2019re still throwing shade. If you\u2019re staying put, open the windows for a cross-breeze and let the morning do its quiet work; it\u2019s a good time to water pot plants, hang a wash, or read by a window where the sun falls but doesn\u2019t bite. By early afternoon, think shade and sips of water\u2014the sky won\u2019t be giving you much mercy today.",
