    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into the small hours under a quilt of broken cloud; the night feels hushed, streetlights ringed with faint halos, and the air a touch damp at the edges. It isn\u2019t a night for stars, and the UV is fast asleep; visibility is decent, but the sky wears a smudged, pewter calm that makes everything quieter than usual.\n\nToward dawn the cloud thickens and a light, passing rain is likely, leaving pavements dark and tidy. Expect a muted start to the day with only stingy hints of sun, so the UV stays modest unless the ceiling breaks later. A thin layer and a light rain shell will suit, with shoes that don\u2019t mind a wet kerb. If you\u2019re awake, make a slow cup and straighten a drawer; after the shower moves on, fetch bread from somewhere nearby or run a small errand, letting the cool, grey morning set the tempo.",
