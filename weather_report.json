    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco feels subdued, the light pressed thin beneath a quilt of cloud. Expect the sky to thicken and give way to light rain from mid-afternoon into early evening, the kind that dapples pavements and hushes the street. Sunshine will be scarce; any brief breaks will be fleeting, with UV likely moderate around early afternoon before easing as the showers roll in. The day\u2019s clarity is soft rather than sharp\u2014horizons a little smudged, reflections brightening wet leaves, visibility otherwise steady.\n\nDress in comfortable layers with a light rain jacket or compact umbrella, and shoes that won\u2019t sulk at a sprinkle; a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray if the cloud thins for a moment. It\u2019s a good afternoon for unhurried errands, a late lunch by the window, browsing a quiet bookshop, or tending to houseplants while the first drops tick the sill. If cabin fever threatens, a short walk between showers will reward you with the gentle perfume of wet gardens and a cooler, kinder breeze.",
