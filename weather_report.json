    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a brilliant afternoon unfolds beneath a dome of azure sky, the sunlight cascading over the city\u2019s iconic architecture, illuminating the intricate dance of light and shadow upon the streets. With temperatures hovering around 60 degrees in the warmth of the day, the atmosphere remains refreshingly crisp. The gentle breath of the southwest wind, playful and spirited, sweeps through, lending a vivacious energy to the scene as it sways the palm fronds and stirs the rustling leaves.\n\nAs twilight approaches, a subtle charm settles over the city, ushering in the evening with a gentle coolness, dipping to a serene 47 degrees. The northwest wind picks up, a whisper of briskness as the sun bids its fond farewell. With clear skies dominating, the marine layer, often a character in this coastal narrative, has taken a back seat for the moment, allowing splendid views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the famed city skyline to shine unobstructed. For those venturing out, layering remains key: a light cardigan or jacket might just be the perfect companion for an evening stroll or a relaxed caf\u00e9 visit, where the lingering warmth of daytime gives way to the invigorating chill of night. As the sun dips lower, it beckons one to contemplate a cozy dinner or perhaps a leisurely walk by the water, where the rippling waves reflect the dreamlike hues of dusk.",
