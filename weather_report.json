    "weather_report": "As dawn creeps over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a hint of moisture, whispering promises of rain. The clouds hang low in a charcoal blanket, muting the brilliance of the skyline that rises against the vague, darkening light. A subtle chill wraps around the city, urging its residents to don layers rather than revel in their usual breezy attire. With temperatures dipping into the 40s, those venturing out should favor warm coats and perhaps a scarf, should the morning\u2019s dampness settle further into the flesh.\n\nThe day ahead is destined for showers, accompanied by a steady wind from the south-southeast that may tease at the edges of an umbrella. As the rain begins to fall, its rhythmic patter could inspire indoor pursuits over outdoor adventures. This might be the perfect moment to wander into a cozy caf\u00e9, the aroma of brewing coffee filling the air, where conversation flows as freely as the warm beverages. The murky sky may obscure the views of the Golden Gate Bridge, but perhaps that lends itself instead to contemplative moments, curled up with a good book as the city grumbles softly under the weight of impending showers.",
