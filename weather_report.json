    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a quiet hush envelops the city, broken only by the gentle rustle of the evening breeze. The sky remains mostly clear, adorned with an expansive canopy of stars, and temperatures are in the low forties, just a touch brisk. Despite the chill, there\u2019s a tranquil beauty to the night, with visibility holding steady as the lights of the city spark to life, casting a soft glow against the darkening horizon.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, expect a respite from the clouds, with the promise of a mostly sunny day. Morning rays will filter in gently, warming a landscape that has stood cool through the night. The forecast hints at a high near fifty-four, with afternoon conditions shifting slightly cooler as the southeast winds whisper through the streets. As far as fog is concerned, the marine layer appears to be holding its distance for now, allowing for a clarity that brings the Golden Gate and the bay into sharp focus.\n\nAs you prepare for the day, layering will be key; a light sweater or a long-sleeve shirt with a windbreaker will suffice for most endeavors, allowing for comfort as you venture out. Consider indulging in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sounds of the water provide a soothing backdrop. An afternoon coffee at a local caf\u00e9 could also serve as a perfect retreat, offering a moment to savor the glow of the day before evening descends once again into chill.",
