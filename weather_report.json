    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky feels newly polished, the kind of clear that lets the quieter streets breathe. Forecasts point to a serene night sliding toward a dawn with a few scattered clouds, the sort that soften the first light rather than smother it. Expect a bright, largely clear day to follow; once the sun lifts, it will have some bite, and the UV will climb quickly, as it does in early summer here. The air should be clean and sharp in the morning, with good visibility and a gentle warmth building as the hours stretch on.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant one if you time it right. For now, light layers suit the cool stillness; by midmorning, shift to airy fabrics, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and sunscreen. If you\u2019re awake, crack a window, set tomorrow\u2019s coffee, or step onto the porch for a minute of quiet. After sunrise, a short walk for bread, a bike roll to the markets, or watering the garden before the sun leans hard into the day would fit the mood nicely.",
