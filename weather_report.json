    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Bend, the sky is already washed clean, stars winking out one by one as a cold hush holds the streets. The day ahead looks simple and honest: unbroken sunshine under a high-desert blue, the kind of clear light that sharpens edges and throws long, pale shadows. Expect a crisp start that likely carries a trace of frost; the air stays dry and lucid, with visibility that feels almost architectural. Sun strength will be gentle early, rising to a modest bite around midday, so the UV index stays low at first and only nudges into the middle range when the sun is high.\n\nDress in layers you can shed without ceremony: a warm coat, hat, and gloves for the morning, then lighter sleeves and sunglasses once the day opens up; a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t be wasted. This is a good day for small, useful rituals\u2014walk the block with a warm cup while the neighborhood wakes, sort a closet by a bright window, run a couple of errands after the frost loosens, take lunch on a sunlit bench, or sweep the porch and let the light have the dust. It\u2019s pleasant in a spare, winter-bright way, the kind of clarity that gets you moving without asking for much.",
