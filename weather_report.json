    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, the weather feels unpredictable yet somehow invigorating, as a blend of sunshine and scattered clouds drapes the city. With temperatures hovering around the brisk high of 59, the air carries a chill, hinting that a warm sweater will be a fine companion throughout the day. As you walk through the streets, the south winds gently tug at your collar, making the prospect of rain later this evening feel all the more tangible. A 40% chance of scattered showers remains, hinting at the day's capricious nature, but for now, you can savor the fleeting glimpses of blue above.\n\nAs the day draws on, expect the clouds to gather, casting a more somber tone over the scenery. By nightfall, a higher likelihood of rain\u2014up to 80%\u2014will emerge, ushering in a cozy, misty ambiance typical of San Francisco's winter months. Dressing in layers will serve you well, and perhaps after an afternoon stroll or a solitary coffee in a whimsical caf\u00e9, consider retreating indoors as the rains begin, allowing yourself to be enveloped by the comforting sounds of the city. A visit to a bookstore or a local art gallery could provide the perfect respite from the approaching showers, where the warmth of a hot drink and a good read can be savored before the rain begins to dance against the windows.",
