The sky, a thick tapestry of grey clouds, blankets the city, promising a low of 53 degrees, while a gentle northeast wind stirs softly at around five miles per hour. With a 60% chance of precipitation, the streets may gleam with the promise of moisture, though any substantial accumulation will remain modest\u2014less than a tenth of an inch.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the rain becomes a steady companion throughout the day, accompanied by a lingering overcast that will keep temperatures cooler, peaking near 61 before surrendering to a slight dip in the afternoon. A southeast breeze of 5 to 9 mph will add to the chill in the air, as a robust 90% chance of rain guarantees a damp experience. As you step out, consider layering comfortably in a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes. The charm of the city invites you to explore cozy caf\u00e9s where you can savor a warm drink or to treat yourself to the artistry of a local museum while the world outside transforms into a watercolor painting of rain and muted colors. Embrace the day with curiosity\u2014a quiet morning stroll on a nearly deserted beach could be invigorating, or a meandering walk through the rain-kissed streets might uncover delightful surprises in hidden shops.",
