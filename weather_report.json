    "weather_report": "Cottesloe basks in the unfettered embrace of serene, clear skies. Clear as the light refracting off the surface of glass, the azure above positively radiates in a resplendent light that can't help but soothe. Warming, kindly, it makes the very spirit of the day feel light; the sun is more a gentle whisper than a fiery shout. A UV index that, despite its measurement, is completely unobtrusive, only adds to the charm.\n\nBetween you, me, and the radiant sun overhead, the weather is nothing short of splendid. The calm of a peaceful afternoon filled with the soothing hum of everyday vibrancy. Unhurried, the day seems to luxuriate in its own glorious pace. One could just as easily slip into a light cotton shirt, letting the gentle warmth banter with your skin and opt for a stroll along the endless stretch of glistening sand. A good book, waiting to be perused under the charm of this sunlight, might be the companion you didn't know you needed. Moreover, the languid warmth suggests an unhurried pace - a day to sip on a cool, iced beverage, watching the waves lazily lapping over the beach might just be the antidote to the world's rush.",
