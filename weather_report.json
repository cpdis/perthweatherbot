    "weather_report": "In beautiful Subiaco, the setting sun paints the clear sky with a gradient of radiant shades, promising an evening as clear as it was earlier today. With the velvet darkness beginning to stretch its fingers, one can expect the temperatures to cool slightly, rendering the evening quite soothing. A balmy wind bristles lightly against the skin, a sweet reminder of summer's touch on the not so distant horizon. \n\nConsidering the agreeable weather conditions, a light cardigan or a warm shawl would make for a wise companion to guard against the chill of twilight. This evening invites strolls in quiet parks, the sounds of rustling leaves as background music to whispered conversations under the sky. Wrapped in this cocoon of tranquility, Subiaco reveals itself as a gentle lullaby coaxing the day to dream under a veil of stars.",
