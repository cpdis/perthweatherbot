    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Swanbourne with a clean, untroubled sky, the kind that lets the first stars arrive early and sharp. The air feels crisp and edging colder by the minute, and with the sun long gone the UV is all but absent. It was a lucid sort of afternoon\u2014clear blue, low winter light, a day that never quite warmed but made up for it with clarity and quiet.\n\nSkies look set to stay clear through the night, pleasant in spirit if not in temperature. Dress in layers and a warm coat; a scarf and gloves will make the difference between brisk and biting. If you\u2019re heading out, a slow amble around the block will do\u2014admire the thin crescent of sky above chimneys and bare branches\u2014then home to something simple: a pot of tea, a book that doesn\u2019t rush, perhaps a little tidying while the house hums softly. For tomorrow\u2019s plans, expect more gentle sun than strength; UV stays low, the light bright but tender, ideal for errands done without haste.",
