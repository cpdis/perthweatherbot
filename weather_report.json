    "weather_report": "Katy spends the late afternoon under a quiet gray lid, the day having woken to overcast skies and never quite shrugging them off. The sun is a rumor behind the cloudbank, so brightness stays gentle and the UV index low; shadows are smudged out, colors soft and a touch blue. Air feels steady rather than sharp, visibility is fine, and the sky promises more of the same as evening draws in, with no strong hint of rain, just a calm, dim clarity.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of weather that rewards simple comforts. A light jacket or sweater over long sleeves will do, maybe a scarf if you run cool; sunglasses can stay home and sunscreen is optional today. Consider a small errand loop before dusk, then a stop at the grocery for something easy to simmer. If you need quiet, a bookstore chair or a corner table at a caf\u00e9 suits the mood; if you need motion, an unhurried walk or a few stretches by the window fit the gray hour. The day is not unpleasant, simply subdued\u2014an invitation to move at half speed and let evening arrive without hurry.",
