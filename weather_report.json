    "weather_report": "As the evening cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the air is tinged with a mild chill, stirring memories of breezy coastal nights. The low temperature, hovering around 48, invites a snug embrace of warm layers. With a gentle north-northeast wind whispering through the streets at a mere 7 mph, you may find comfort in a light jacket while stepping outside. Clouds gather overhead, mostly keeping the night a soft gray, rendering the glimmer of streetlights and distant city hues largely muted, though the pulse of urban life continues.\n\nThe dawn of Friday promises a slow awakening, as patchy fog hints at a whimsical dance across the bay. Anticipate a gradual lifting of this veil before 10 AM, revealing a partially sunny disposition as the day unfolds. Expect the temperatures to creep up near 59, but a gentle descent into the afternoon around 57 will keep that cozy feeling persistent. Those venturing out might opt for a cardigan layered over a long-sleeve shirt\u2014ideal for the cool, lingering fog, but also adaptable for the brighter patches that might grace the sky. Given these conditions, a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s, where you can savor a warm drink while people-watching, would suit the day perfectly, allowing one to absorb the city\u2019s vibrant pulse in its own understated charm.",
