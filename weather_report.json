    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a lucid noon sky, the sun bright and insistent, with only the hint of fair-weather cloud expected to gather as the afternoon unwinds. The light feels clean and far-reaching, the sort that sharpens edges and shortens shadows. It\u2019s broadly sunny, and the UV index will be high through early afternoon before easing later, so the day is pleasant but asks a little respect from the skin.\n\nThrough the rest of the day expect sunshine with scattered clouds drifting by and a generally dry, easy feel; a gentle breeze may freshen toward the coast, taking the glare down a notch by late afternoon. Dress in light, breathable layers with sunglasses and a brimmed hat, and keep sunscreen close. This is good weather for modest plans: a shaded caf\u00e9 lunch, a slow circuit of local errands on foot, a quiet hour at the library, or a quick sweep of the garden. As the sun softens, a small detour through the park or along your usual route will feel just right.",
