With temperatures hovering around a cool 49 degrees, a slight uptick to around 51 is anticipated overnight. The tranquil north-northeast winds, brushing in at about 7 mph, add a crispness to the evening air, enhancing the feeling of a typical San Francisco night\u2014a touch of chill mixed with the spectral lights of the city.\n\nThe morning promises to bring a transformation as the clouds clear, revealing mostly sunny skies, with highs projected near a comfortable 62. As the sun ascends, the early chill will give way to pleasant warmth, yet the afternoon may usher in cooler breezes and descending temperatures around 58. Given the fading light and the veil of clouds tonight, one might expect a hint of fog lingering near the coast, softening the outlines of the hills and the iconic structures. For those stepping out, layering will be key\u2014a warm sweater and a light jacket for the cooler moments, perhaps complemented by comfortable shoes for an ambled stroll through the serene streets or a leisurely visit to an outdoor caf\u00e9. As dusk deepens, it\u2019s an ideal time for a gentle walk along the waterfront, savoring the tranquility before the bustle of the coming day.",
