With temperatures beginning to dip into the lower forties, the morning is brisk, urging a lightweight jacket or a cozy sweater to accompany your wanderings.\n\nThe horizon\u2019s clarity, while currently unobscured, will soon yield to a soft draping of clouds as the day unfolds, setting the stage for an afternoon of intermittent sun and showers.

Embrace the texture of the day, with its mix of brisk winds and fleeting sunlight, perhaps indulging in a quiet caf\u00e9 visit to savor a hot cup of coffee. The chance of rain makes for lovely companionship\u2014an invitation to pause, reflect, and explore the city\u2019s hidden corners, all while savoring the warmth of a simple moment.",
