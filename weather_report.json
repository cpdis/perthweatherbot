The air is cool and simple; windows cracked open feel right, and the world seems neatly put away.\n\nToward dawn the clarity holds, setting up a bright, unblemished morning and a lucid blue day. Expect honest sunshine and a quick climb in glare; by late morning the spring sun will bite, with UV likely high, so sunglasses, sunscreen, and a brimmed hat earn their keep. Start with a light layer for the small hours, then slide into short sleeves as the day opens; keep a spare layer at hand in case a coastal whisper takes the edge off. It looks like a pleasant day for ordinary satisfactions: an early amble to clear the head, airing the house, hanging a load of washing, a quiet pedal to the bakery, or reading in a pocket of shade while the light runs long and clean.",
