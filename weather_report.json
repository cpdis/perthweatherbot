    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Subiaco, the gentle patter of light rain taps a rhythmic melody against the quiet, sleepy streets. This lingering rain, as forecasted through the night, casts a misty veil over the town, painting the morning in shades of muted gray. Today's sky is likely to remain obscured, the sun a distant companion hiding behind its impenetrable curtain. While sunshine may seem but a whispered promise today, the air is cool and brisk, inviting you to adorn yourself with layers\u2014a cozy sweater, a waterproof jacket\u2014to shield against the occasional drizzle. Embark on this day with a contemplative spirit; the soothing ambiance holds a distinctive charm. Perhaps, an unrushed amble through the rain-dappled pavements will elicit a sense of serenity, or maybe nestle indoors with a book, sipping warm tea as raindrops trace their paths down your window, each one a fleeting moment of quiet introspection. The canvas of today is not painted with vivid colors but offers a serene, monochrome palette inviting peace and reflection, coaxing out moments of still beauty in the ordinary.",
