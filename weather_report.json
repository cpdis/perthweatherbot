    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into a polished, transparent night, the kind where the day\u2019s glare has retired and the sky looks newly washed. The forecast keeps it simple: clear this evening and clear after midnight, which means no sun now and a UV index that has curled up and gone to sleep. The day likely wore a bright, uncomplicated face, and the clarity lingers after dark; visibility is crisp, stars feel close, and the air carries that faint, cooling hush that invites unhurried breaths.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant night if you dress with a little foresight: a light jacket or soft sweater over whatever you wore to work, maybe a scarf if you plan to linger. This is good weather for small, ordinary pleasures\u2014an easy loop around the block beneath the jacarandas, a quiet sit on the veranda with a book, a tidy of the kitchen, watering the pots, or a call you\u2019ve been meaning to make. If you\u2019re stepping out early tomorrow, plan for a sunny start and take sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen; clear nights often hand the morning a bright, quickening light.",
