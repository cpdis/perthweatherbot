    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into late afternoon under a shawl of grey, the light turned soft and pewter as showers gather on the horizon. The day has lost its sharp edges; visibility is gentle rather than crystal, with the kind of sky that mutes color and quiets the streets. Sunshine will be scarce from here on, and the UV sits low and sinking with the approach of evening. Expect light rain to drift through around dusk and return again later, more a persistent whisper than a downpour, the sort that dapples pavements and perfumes the air.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for small comforts and sensible layers: a light waterproof jacket, closed shoes, and a pocket umbrella will keep the mood intact. Consider an unhurried errand run before the steadier showers, then a detour to a bookshop or a corner caf\u00e9 window where you can watch the rain stitch silvery threads across the street. Supper at home suits the weather\u2014something warm on the stove while you sort tomorrow\u2019s to-do list and let the evening pass with the soft patter outside.",
