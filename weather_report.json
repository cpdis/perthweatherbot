    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into night beneath a lightly brushed sky: the afternoon offered a clean, gentle sun between a few clouds, and now scattered patches drift in with the dark. Clarity has been good all day, the kind where buildings look newly etched and distances feel close; with the sun gone, the UV drops to almost nothing and the light softens to a quiet blue.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant, unfussy evening. Dress with a light layer\u2014something you can shrug on if you decide to linger\u2014and comfortable shoes for an unhurried circuit of the neighborhood. Pick up a small errand, water the balcony pots, or sit at a window and let the last of the day pass while a record hums in the background. If you\u2019re heading out, it\u2019s the sort of weather that suits an early supper outdoors or a slow ride home with the windows cracked, the air cool but not insistent.",
