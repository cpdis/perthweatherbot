    "weather_report": "City Beach slides into late afternoon beneath a rinsed-blue sky, the sun tilting low and mellowing from its midday glare. Earlier it was unfiltered and insistent, the sort of light that pushes the UV to lively heights; now the sting is softening, but a hat and a whisper of sunscreen still make sense if you linger. The day feels transparent and clean, edges sharp, sea and sand drawn in simple, faithful colors.\n\nExpect the rest of the day to stay clear and dry, an easy runway to sunset and a mild, star-pricked evening. It\u2019s a pleasant, companionable kind of weather. Dress light, keep sunglasses handy, and carry a thin layer for when the warmth ebbs after dusk. Good hours for ordinary comforts: a slow walk along the path, a quiet coffee at an outdoor table, tidying the balcony plants, or a gentle ride to run that small errand before the light slips away.",
