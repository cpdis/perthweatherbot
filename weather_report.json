    "weather_report": "Just past midnight, Subiaco sits under a clean, ink-blue sky, the kind of clear that makes the air feel a shade cooler and the streets sound softer. The night is steady and uncomplicated: no cloud to smudge the moonlight, no hint of damp in the breeze. By dawn the clarity should deepen into a bright, untroubled day, the sun taking quick command and the UV climbing briskly once it\u2019s up. Expect a crisp start and a gentle drift toward warmth, the sort of morning where colors look freshly laundered and even small shadows are well drawn.\n\nDress in light layers: something cozy for the early hours, then pare back to breathable fabrics, with sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen once the sun gets ambition. It looks like pleasant weather to keep simple\u2014brew coffee and open a window, take a quiet walk before breakfast, or cycle to a nearby shop while the streets still have that Sunday hush. By late morning, tend to balcony plants, air out linens, or read by a sunlit window; at midday, steal some shade and let the afternoon unspool without hurry.",
