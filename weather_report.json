    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a rinsed-blue morning, the air clear enough to make the jacaranda leaves look lacquered. Mid-morning brings only a few wandering wisps, and by early afternoon the sky is set to polish into a bright, unblemished sheet of blue. The sun already has a hard edge to it; UV will feel insistent and then fierce around midday, the day crystalline, dry, and a touch glary rather than gentle.\n\nDress light and breathable, brimmed hat and dark lenses, sunscreen without stinginess, and keep a bottle of water close. Take your errands or a quiet coffee on a shaded veranda before lunch, then give yourself to indoor tasks while the light is loudest: a tidy of the study, a batch of washing hung early, a lazy browse at the library. When the edge softens later, a short amble beneath the plane trees or a meander through Kings Park will feel kinder, the breeze\u2014if it stirs\u2014sanding the heat down to something companionable.",
