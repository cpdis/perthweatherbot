    "weather_report": "As the day unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, it presents itself in a tapestry of deep blue, unmarred by clouds or fog. The brisk north winds play across the city, whisking away any lingering morning chill while beckoning those below to step outdoors and relish the invigorating air. With temperatures hovering around a refreshing 62 degrees, the afternoon invites a gentle shedding of layers, yet a light sweater might still serve well as evening draws near.\n\nThis clear afternoon, with panoramic views stretching toward the Golden Gate and the city\u2019s skyline glinting in the sunlight, is simply delightful for a stroll through the streets or a visit to a local caf\u00e9. As dusk approaches, the clarity continues, and the winds may sharpen, encouraging companions to gather in cozy spaces or share a quiet moment on the waterfront, watching the lights dance upon the bay\u2019s calm surface. Layer wisely, and perhaps treat yourself to the pleasures of an al fresco dinner as the air cools around 49 degrees tonight. Embrace the orchestra of activity that such a radiant day incites, casting aside mundane routines for moments of simple beauty and warmth shared among friends.",
