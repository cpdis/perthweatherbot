    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a serene evening: the few late-afternoon clouds thinned out, leaving a clean, star-pricked sky and a sense of order in the air. Sunlight has gone soft and then gone entirely, so the UV has slipped to nothing; it\u2019s a clear, gentle night, the kind that feels honest and uncluttered. Expect the rest of the evening to stay calm and bright in its own quiet way, with good visibility and a touch of cool as the hours lengthen. A light jacket or cardigan will be enough, perhaps a scarf if you linger outdoors. It\u2019s a pleasant time for an unhurried loop around the block, a small errand to the corner shop, or a few minutes on the balcony with the day\u2019s thoughts, letting the quiet do its work.",
