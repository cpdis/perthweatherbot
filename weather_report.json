    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is a clean pane of glass, stars pricked sharp above the dark jacarandas. The air sits mild and still, the kind of quiet that makes the neighborhood sound like it\u2019s holding its breath. It\u2019s a clear night now and toward dawn stays the same: no murk, no mist, just a bare-bones sky.\n\nExpect a bright, dry day to follow, the sun coming on with confidence and very little cloud to temper it. UV is gentle at this hour but will surge quickly after sunrise, likely fierce by late morning; plan shade, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out. A light layer will serve you before daybreak, then breathable fabrics for the afternoon. It looks like one of those uncomplicated Perth days: crisp visibility, colors turned up, errands easy. Enjoy the early calm with a quiet walk for coffee, water the garden before the light gets sharp, hang a load of washing to drink in the breeze, or cycle to the shops before the sun starts bargaining hard. Later, keep to the cooler side of the street and let the house breathe; evening will bring back that easy clarity.",
