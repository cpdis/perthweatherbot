    "weather_report": "Today's weather in Downtown San Francisco embraces the gentle embrace of rain, weaving a tapestry of clouds above. The high hovers near a cool 59, gradually descending as afternoon succumbs to evening. The winds from the south are brisk, bringing a tenacious coolness that dances through the streets, while raindrops promise to christen the asphalt with their soothing touch. With a certainty of 100% chance of precipitation, umbrellas will be more than mere accessories; they\u2019ll be essential companions throughout the day.\n\nTonight, the rain will persist, wrapping the city in a cozy shroud with temperatures slipping to about 52. The winds will whisper a little softer, but still push through with waves of vigorous gusts. Dressing in layers would be wise\u2014think of a snug jacket over a comfortable sweater, perhaps a waterproof outer layer to keep the rain at bay, paired with sturdy footwear suited for slick sidewalks. As the day winds into evening, consider a quiet retreat into a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth and aroma of freshly brewed coffee await. You might witness the rain painting the window panes, casting a serene backdrop as the city pulses quietly beyond.",
