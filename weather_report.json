    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the sun generously casts its golden light, illuminating the hills and streets below. A gentle north wind brushes through the air, offering a cool respite as temperatures hover near a pleasant 60 degrees. The clarity of the day presents a stunning panorama, unmarred by fog, revealing the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge against a backdrop of gentle clouds. As twilight approaches, however, a shift is on the horizon; the forecast predicts rain to start after 4 a.m., adding an element of mystery to tonight's parting hours, as a low, enveloping cloud begins to cloak the skies.\n\nTo embrace the day, a light jacket or sweater would be advisable, particularly as the evening air dips toward the low 50s. Those venturing outside may find joy in an afternoon stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while enjoying the vibrant buzz of the city weaving through its neighborhoods. As the sun sets and the whispers of rain linger in the air, there's a peculiar charm to the prospect of rain\u2014a reminder that life in this beautiful city ebbs and flows like the tides that lap against its shores.",
