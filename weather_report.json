    "weather_report": "San Francisco greets the afternoon with a refreshing clarity, the type that invites introspection as much as it does exploration. The sky stretches overhead, a canvas of vibrant blue, while the high temperatures hover around 62 degrees, offering a gentle warmth that is tempered by a brisk north wind. The wind whispers through the streets, rustling leaves and carrying the fresh scent of the bay, but it also promises a slight chill, urging residents to consider a light jacket or wrap. \n\nAs evening approaches, the air will cool further, settling into the upper 40s beneath a star-studded sky that is predicted to remain clear. With gusts enhancing the evening crispness, the conditions are optimal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city's parks, offering an opportunity to breathe in the city's vibrant pulse as it transitions from day to night. Tonight is not for the faint of spirit; it beckons those with a taste for tranquil voyages, be it a thoughtful drink on a patio or a reflective walk past the luminescent silhouettes of the skyline, all beneath the expansive twilight that encapsulates this city of hidden treasures.",
