    "weather_report": "Subiaco is wrapped in a quiet, lucid night; the sky is clear and the air has that gentle, pared-back cool that carries sound and thought a little farther than usual. Stars are clean-edged, streets unhurried, a good hour for open windows and unhurried breaths.\n\nToward dawn, the clarity should hold: a cloudless sunrise, a bright, decisive morning sliding into a plainly sunny day. UV is negligible now but will climb quickly after breakfast, so plan for shade and a hat once the light hardens. A light layer suits the small hours; by mid-morning you\u2019ll want breathable fabrics and easy shoes. If you\u2019re awake early, water the garden at first light, take a brief walk before the glare arrives, or set a load of washing to make use of the dry air. Later, errands and coffee are best tucked into the morning, saving the early afternoon for indoor tasks and cool rooms.",
