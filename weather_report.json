    "weather_report": "The sun casts a soft, golden light across Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, illuminating puddles of lingering dew as it warms the day's crisp air. Although the high temperature hovers just around fifty-eight degrees, small doses of warmth ripple through the cool breeze, brushing against your skin with gentle insistence. As the day progresses, expect the temperature to dip slightly, nudging you towards more layered attire. A light jacket is advisable, perhaps complemented by a scarf for that touch of warmth as you stroll along the vibrant streets, where life pulses through the cafes and market stalls, spilling over with the energy of urban dwellers and visitors alike.\n\nAs twilight approaches, patchy fog will embrace the city, adding an enchanting quality to the evening. The clouds linger in the distance, teasing the edges of the bay, and inviting a sense of calm. This evening's forecast promises a low around forty-nine degrees, suggesting that cozy spots\u2014perhaps a quiet table by the window of a favorite caf\u00e9 or a leisurely walk along the waterfront\u2014are ideal for savoring the slow descent into night. With the gentle wind favoring a westward direction, the air feels fresh and bracing, offering a rejuvenating backdrop for quiet reflection or a leisurely conversation with friends beneath the slowly darkening sky.",
