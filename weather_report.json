    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a lingering chill, shadows still draped in a muted gray blanket. The forecast warns of rain before the day takes a turn towards partial sunlight, but for now, the clouds hang low, possibly shrouding the iconic skyline and the distant Golden Gate Bridge in a veil of soft haze. The streets breathe in anticipation of the impending rain, the ground already ripe for the moisture that promises to arrive with considerable vigor, perhaps washing away the remnants of the previous day.\n\nAs the day develops, the high temperature will hover around a cool 56 degrees, gradually giving way to a slightly warmer feel of 54 in the afternoon. A brisk west-southwest wind lifts the morning air, carrying with it the scent of impending rain and secession from summer\u2019s warmth. For those venturing out, layers would be wise\u2014the comfort of a light jacket paired with a cozy sweater underneath will provide a buffer against the chill, complemented by a sturdy umbrella for the sporadic showers. Consider a stroll among the city's vibrant streets, perhaps stopping by a local caf\u00e9 to sip on something warm as the world outside shifts between bouts of sunlight and shadow. The unfolding day invites a gentle exploration of urban delights, from art-filled alleys to serene parks, an ideal complement to this atmospheric transition.",
