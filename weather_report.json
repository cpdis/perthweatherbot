    "weather_report": "A damp, early hush lies over Burswood; light rain is slipping through the last of the night and expected to linger into the morning, keeping the river pewter and the streets satin-dark. Sunshine will be scarce at first, with the sky holding to a soft, woolen grey; UV stays low this morning and only edges toward moderate if the cloud thins later. The air feels freshly washed but not quite clear\u2014horizons blurred, sound slightly muffled\u2014an amiable gloom that asks for unhurried steps.\n\nDress for a cool, showery start: a light waterproof, comfortable shoes, and a small umbrella you won\u2019t mind carrying. If you\u2019re out early, a quick tram of errands or a meander beneath trees during a lull can be quietly satisfying; otherwise, let the day begin indoors with coffee, a tidy of the week\u2019s papers, or a bit of slow cooking while the windows bead with rain. Should the ceiling lift toward midday, take a short stroll along the river paths and watch the light try its luck between showers.",
