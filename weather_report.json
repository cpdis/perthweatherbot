    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a polished, unbroken blue this early afternoon; the sun has a decisive bite to it and the UV is running high for now, likely relaxing as the afternoon stretches toward evening. The light is crisp and honest, edges well-defined, the kind of clarity that makes colors pop and time feel a little slower.\n\nThe rest of the day looks simple and generous: clear skies through the afternoon, then a gentler glow toward sunset. Dress light, keep a hat and sunglasses close, and give your skin some sunscreen. Carry a bottle of water if you\u2019re lingering outdoors. It\u2019s good weather for quiet errands on foot, a short walk to the caf\u00e9, hanging a line of washing, or tending the herb pots and letting the warmth soak in. If you prefer to stay out of the glare, open a window and read where the light pools softly; later, when the sun eases, take an unhurried lap around the block and let the evening settle in.",
