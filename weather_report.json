    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Albany with a quilt of scattered clouds drifting across a fading sky. Earlier, the day moved from broken to more open patches, sun slipping in and out as if testing the room, offering light without glare. That meant some brightness but no harshness; the UV would have peaked modestly around midafternoon and now has fallen to a gentle zero, the kind of light that flatters brick and leaf and makes the river look thoughtful. The air reads as seasonably comfortable, tilting cool as night gathers, and the view feels mostly clear between the cloud breaks.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant, low-drama night to be out briefly and unhurried. A light jacket or sweater will serve, sleeves down if you plan to linger. A short stroll to the corner for tea or a forgotten ingredient, a quiet loop with the dog, or a few minutes on the stoop listening to the neighborhood hum would fit. The forecast looks dry, the mood unruffled, the sky offering just enough texture to keep you looking up.",
