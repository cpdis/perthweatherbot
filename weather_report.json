    "weather_report": "Katy woke to light rain, and the afternoon still feels washed and hushed, the streets a little slick, the sky a soft, stubborn gray. Sunbreaks are fleeting at best; the UV stays low beneath the quilt of cloud, and the horizon looks smudged, as if someone took an eraser to the edges of town. Expect a mostly cloudy close to the day, perhaps a stray sprinkle, more damp than dramatic\u2014weather that asks for patience rather than headlines.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for a light waterproof layer and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles; carry an umbrella just in case. The air may read cooler than the thermometer suggests, so a long-sleeve or thin sweater will feel right. With the light fading, lean into small comforts: a grocery run for supper staples, a quiet lap through the library, a tidy-up at home, or a short neighborhood walk between drops to watch the evening settle, calm and reflective.",
