    "weather_report": "Subiaco has spent the day under a clean, unmarked sky; morning through midday stayed bright and unwavering, and the light now, late afternoon, is softening toward honey. With the sun so unfiltered, it has been a strongly sunny day, the kind where the UV bites at noon and only begins to loosen its grip by this hour. Air and vista feel uncomplicated and clear, colors a little more saturated than usual, the sort of clarity that sharpens edges without hardening them.\n\nAs the heat eases and shadows grow longer, it looks like a pleasant early evening ahead. Dress in light, breathable layers, add sunglasses, and if you\u2019re wandering before dusk, a hat won\u2019t go astray; sunscreen was essential earlier and is still sensible. This is good weather for small errands on foot, a meander to pick up something for dinner, watering the garden, or a quiet lap around the block to rinse the day from your mind. Windows open, kettle on, the sky doing its slow golden turn.",
