    "weather_report": "After a lucid, blue afternoon, Swanbourne has slipped into a glassy, clear night. Skies stayed open from mid-afternoon into early evening, so the sun had free run while it lasted, though at this time of year its bite is gentle and the UV low; now, with darkness settled, it\u2019s all cool air and sharp stars. Expect the rest of the evening to remain dry and serene, with excellent clarity and a pleasant hush that makes every footstep sound precise.\n\nDress for the chill: a warm coat, layers, perhaps a scarf for the walk back from the station or the dog\u2019s last loop. It\u2019s good weather for small, practical things\u2014taking the long way to the shop, checking the car, a quiet saunter to clear the head, or a brief look up to find Orion staking his claim over the rooftops\u2014then home to something warm. If you were out earlier, sunglasses would have been more useful than you\u2019d expect in late autumn; now, it\u2019s simply clear, calm and kind to anyone who likes their evening uncomplicated.",
