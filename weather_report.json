    "weather_report": "The evening in Downtown San Francisco wraps itself in a tranquil blanket of mostly clear skies, a welcome respite from the urban hustle. As night deepens, temperatures dip gently, hovering around a crisp 49 degrees, with a whispering north wind that softly stirs the air. This calm ambiance invites cozy layers; a light jacket or sweater should suffice for those stepping out.\n\nTomorrow dawns with the promise of sunshine illuminating the city. A high near 63 degrees beckons, but expect a slight cool-down as the afternoon rolls in\u2014a typical dance of San Francisco weather. The clarity of the day portends beautiful views, though the gentle breath of the marine layer may linger at the edges, softly reminding all of the city\u2019s coastal charm. Take advantage of this delightful day to explore local parks or stroll along the waterfront where the vibrant city meets the bay. Perhaps a visit to one of the cozy coffee shops, where the warmth from inside can meet the cool, fresh air outside, would be most inviting.",
