    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the skies are partially cloaked in clouds, holding a spattering of warmth that hints at a cool, crisp evening ahead. The temperature hovers gently around mid-forties, with a soft breeze whispering from the southwest, guiding those who venture outside to embrace the shifting air. The forecast promises a chance of rain by morning, but for now, the twilight offers a delicate tableau\u2014clear enough to appreciate the shimmering city lights, yet shrouded in enough mystery to feel the city's pulse.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with a dance of sunshine and clouds, peeking in and out among shadows as the day progresses. Highs will linger close to the fifties, gradually giving way to cooler afternoon breezes. The likelihood of rain introduces an element of unpredictability, making it wise to dress in layers, preparing for both the fleeting warmth of sunlight and the cool caress of moisture. It could be a splendid day for a brisk walk by the waterfront, where the salty air mingles with the aromatic scents just before rain\u2014as the world waits, catching its breath, for both the sun\u2019s glow and the ocean\u2019s embrace.",
