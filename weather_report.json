    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in the small hours under a damp hush, with rain prowling in at dawn and easing to lighter, showery moods through the morning. The sky looks pewter rather than pearl; the sun will be shy, peeking only if the cloudfield frays later on. Expect a soft, milky clarity with wet roads and a little mist in the edges, more rinse than sparkle. UV stays subdued while the blanket holds, nudging only modestly higher if breaks appear after lunch, nothing fierce for late winter.\n\nDress for a cool, drizzly start: a light waterproof, layered knit, and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles; a hood or compact umbrella will spare you the gusty spatter. It\u2019s a morning for the kettle, a quiet tram of emails, and small errands between showers; claim a window seat at a cafe and let the day shuffle past in reflections. If the rain slackens later, take a short walk to breathe the eucalyptus and watch the streets darken and shine, then head home to something simple on the stove and an early night.",
