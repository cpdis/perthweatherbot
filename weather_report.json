    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with a quilt of scattered clouds gliding past, letting a few shy stars wink through. The day never turned harsh; light was filtered and easy, and now the sun is long gone and the UV has slipped to nothing. The air feels steady and calm, the view clear enough to trace rooftops and trees in soft relief, a quiet sky with just enough texture to keep it interesting.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant, unhurried evening. A light jacket or soft sweater will suit the slow air; comfortable shoes if you feel like a short wander. This is good weather for modest tasks and small pleasures: a gentle loop around the block, returning a library book or posting a note, tidying a corner of the house with the windows open to the night, or watering the plants and letting the cool drift in while you cue up tomorrow\u2019s plans.",
