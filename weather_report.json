    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, the streets feel hushed and softly silvered; a light rain is due to drift in around sunrise and linger through the breakfast hours. Sun will be scarce this morning, more a shy glow behind cloud than a warm companion, and the UV stays low until any breaks appear later. The day\u2019s edges look blurred\u2014rooftops dulled, colors muted, the air a little cool and damp rather than cold\u2014making for a gentle, grey start that\u2019s more contemplative than bright.\n\nDress for drizzle: light layers, a breathable shell, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and a small umbrella. It\u2019s good weather for a slow coffee at home, clearing a corner of the desk, or wandering out for fresh bread when the rain slackens. If the sky shows seams of blue later, the UV can wake up quickly, so keep sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen in your bag. Otherwise, let the morning be unhurried: a library visit, a short errand under awnings, and a quiet stroll when the pavements stop shining.",
