    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Sunday in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm blankets the city, marked by a clear sky that hints at the promise of a new day. As the sun prepares to rise, temperatures hover around a modest level, inviting a snug embrace from light layers. The tranquility is momentarily disrupted by the increasing likelihood of rain, anticipated to arrive after mid-morning. The air is thick with the scent of impending moisture and a soft whisper of wind, a precursor to the cool, damp atmosphere that will soon settle in.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the sun to flirt briefly with the horizon before clouds cloak the sky, leading to temperatures that will gradually dance downwards. The chance of rain looms heavier as we approach the afternoon, and with it, the comforting layers of a light jacket will become essential. A stroll through the streets, perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, or meandering through the city's vibrant alleys adorned with art, could provide solace from the anticipated drizzle. Navigating this mix of sun and showers, one might embrace the subtle beauty of a city transitioning from stillness to a gentle, rain-kissed vibrancy.",
