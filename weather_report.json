    "weather_report": "The evening in Subiaco unrolls itself gently, already cloaked in a thin veil of scattered clouds, both an overt and unobtrusive harbinger to the coming weather. The light of a fading day filters through them, casting a dappled glow of refracted rays on the quiet town. It's been a tranquil afternoon, the sky a canvas of serenity interrupted only by the occasional drifting cloud. The quietude though, is a silhouetted prelude to the first hesitant whispers of rainfall that will start to murmur come the evening hour. An anticipated duet between nature's symphony and the rhythm of the setting day. \n\nUnseen to the eye, but felt against your skin, the UV index is non-threatening, the receding sun allowing a subtle coolness to sift through the thinning curtain of afternoon light. Dress in layers, for as the sky darkens, the temperatures begin their inevitable descend, while the sigh of approaching rain hints at night's brisk lullaby. It's a perfect evening for an unhurried stroll, the soft patter of rain infusing the air with a fresh, earthy scent, or perhaps indulging in a quiet evening indoors with a good book, as the outer world is cradled by the gentle drumming of raindrops. For all its soft subtleties, this day unwraps in Subiaco, a placid symphony that marries sun, cloud and rain in its unfolding narrative.",
