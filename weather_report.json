    "weather_report": "The morning carries an unmistakable chill as rain sweeps through Downtown San Francisco. The sky hangs heavy with clouds, enshrouding the city in a damp embrace, where visibility is muffled by the relentless downpour. As the wind gusts from the south, the air acquires a rare vitality, stirring the atmosphere, yet it does little to dispel the chilly moisture that permeates all things. The forecast promises not only persistent rain, but also a gradual rise in temperature, suggesting a softening of the morning chill as the day unfolds into a gray twilight.\n\nWith the rain steadily falling, you might consider those mundane yet comforting indoor pursuits\u2014perhaps cradling a warm mug of coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9, allowing the aroma of fresh pastries to mingle with the outside drizzle. Alternatively, a leisurely stroll through the quietened streets can evoke the city's charm, aptly adorned with slick sidewalks and muted colors, provided you're equipped with a suitable rain jacket and sturdy footwear to navigate the puddles that will inevitably form. This is a day for reflection and solace, a time to embrace the quiet moments that rain often invites.",
