    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a soft veil of clarity drapes over the city, hinting at a mostly sunny disposition. The lingering coolness of the air\u2014soon to pull back and settle near 50\u2014evokes a comforting embrace rather than a harsh chill. Above, wisps of cloud flirt with the blue, while gentle winds whisper secrets from the west, inviting those outdoors to breathe in the crispness of the day. For those venturing into the streets, a light jacket should suffice, particularly as the twilight beckons and temperatures dip down to a tranquil 47 tonight.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the city will cloak itself in a familiar softness, the cloudy expanse curling tightly around familiar sights, hinting at the ghostly marine layer lurking nearby. Even with its muted palette, the charm of these urban scenes persists, inviting wanderers for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a comforting coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps savoring the simple pleasure of the day winding down\u2014a reflective space before the quietude of evening unfolds.",
