    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco arrives with a soft, pewter sky and the promise of light showers drifting through late morning and again in the early afternoon, the kind that hush the streets and make the leaves look newly minted. Sunshine will be shy today, with only brief, silvery breaks at best; the clarity is muted, edges blurred by drizzle and a gentle onshore breeze. Even so, midday UV can still bite through high cloud, so a touch of sunscreen is wise. It\u2019s a pleasant-enough day if you lean into it: cool, damp, and quietly companionable rather than bright.\n\nDress for passing rain\u2014light layers, a waterproof shell, and shoes that won\u2019t mind wet pavements. Keep a small umbrella in your bag. Consider a lingering coffee by a window, a browse through a bookshop, or a quick gallery stop between showers; when the rain eases, take a short stroll under the plane trees and enjoy the clean, rain-lifted air, then slip back indoors to tick off a few errands with unhurried grace.",
