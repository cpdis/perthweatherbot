The horizon lies untouched by fog; instead, a gentle breeze carries the crispness of early winter, ensuring a refreshing experience for all. The sun, though still low, casts a delicate glow over the iconic skyline, promising a high temperature near 62 as the day progresses. Yet, as afternoon approaches, expect a subtle shift, allowing temperatures to hover around a cool 58, with northeast winds nudging at 9 mph, occasionally gusting to 20 mph\u2014a reminder of the city's ever-unpredictable charm.\n\nAs night falls, the clarity persists, with mostly clear skies offering a serene backdrop for evening strolls. The low dips to a cool 45, rising slightly as the night deepens, guided by gentle winds from the east. In such weather, layered clothing would be ideal\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a long-sleeved shirt, complemented by a scarf to ward off any evening chill. These conditions invite a leisurely exploration of neighborhood caf\u00e9s, aiming for warm beverages while watching the city transition from the hustle of the day to the tranquility of night, or a stroll along the Embarcadero to savor the waterfront's peaceful whispers.",
