The sky is not just clear but pristine, offering a beautiful canvas as the sun prepares to rise, ushering in a day forecasted to warm up to approximately 62 degrees. A light breeze from the north northwest adds a pleasant touch, ensuring the atmosphere feels brisk but inviting.\n\nThe city is waking up softly, with the promise of sunshine that will illuminate its iconic features, though expect temperatures to dip slightly in the afternoon. There\u2019s no hint of fog or marine layer threatening the visibility, making it an ideal day for those who appreciate clarity in their surroundings. As the hours pass, one might find delight in a leisurely morning walk along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for coffee at a local caf\u00e9 and soaking in the views. With such pleasant conditions, a light jacket would suffice for the earlier chill, transitioning to lighter layers as the day progresses, before retreating into the warmth of home later. Engage in a little exploration, or simply enjoy the subtle rhythm of the city as it comes alive.",
