    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a muted light struggles to penetrate the cloud cover, cloaking the city in a shroud of gray. The day begins rather drearily, with an ever-present feeling of moisture in the air and a slight chance of rain lingering until the afternoon. Temperatures hover near a cool 62 degrees, shortly dropping, setting the tone for a day that promises to be mostly cloud-covered, with whispers of a brisk southeast wind weaving through the streets. \n\nAs evening approaches, the atmosphere thickens, bringing an inevitable downpour that will sweep through the city between ten and four, transitioning into showers and perhaps the distant rumble of thunder. It\u2019s a night for layers \u2014 a warm jacket to ward off the chill, perhaps a scarf to fend off the dampness that settles in; comfort is key amidst the drizzly bite of the season. The suggestion of iconic San Francisco fog hangs in the air, possibly mingling with rain, painting a scene that encourages one to seek the cozy refuge of a local caf\u00e9. Sip on something warm while watching rain-soaked streets shimmer under the soft glow of city lights. This is a day to embrace urban warmth over the cool, damp atmosphere, and find joy in quiet moments with a book or conversations shared over cups of steaming coffee.",
