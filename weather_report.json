    "weather_report": "As the night slowly surrenders to dawn, Downtown San Francisco basks in a tranquil calm, with the air carrying a whisper of the sea and a chill that speaks to the heart of winter. Overnight, the clouds have dissipated, leaving behind a clarity that hints at a crisp but inviting day ahead. The thermometer will rise gently, challenging the cool embrace of the morning with a promise of sunshine that will warm the spirit, reaching heights teetering around a comfortable 63 degrees. The faint breath of a southward wind nudges at two miles per hour, barely more than a sigh, making this a perfect morning for a quiet walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps indulging in a leisurely cup of coffee at one of the cozy cafes dotting the streets. \n\nAs the sun rises higher, it will cast long shadows over the city\u2019s iconic landmarks, washing them in a golden glow. The forecast suggests that the marine layer has retreated, granting respite from the omnipresent fog that often cloaks the Bay. Yet, one may glimpse remnants of the coastal mist lurking in the distance, whispering of the bay's enchanting mystique. Dress in layers; a light jacket or cardigan will suffice for the chill of the morning, but be prepared to shed it as the sun's warmth becomes more inviting. It's a day tailored for the mundane joys of life\u2014perhaps a stroll to explore the hidden corners of a beloved neighborhood or sitting outside to savor the details of a good book.",
