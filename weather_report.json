    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the sky is enshrouded in a thick blanket of clouds, with the ever-present drizzle contributing to an atmosphere drenched in moisture. Raindrops tap quietly against the pavement, matching the somber tones of the day as temperatures hover near the chill of 55 degrees. Whispers of wind embrace the streets, laden with the scent of wet earth, while gusts shift the rain, promising a continued downpour through the evening. Visibility is reduced, as the familiar outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and city skyline fade in and out of focus, ensnared by the persistent moisture and hints of fog wrapping around the hills.\n\nThis day beckons comfort rather than adventure. A cozy sweater or a reliable waterproof jacket would serve well against the cool, damp air as you explore the city\u2019s warm caf\u00e9s or perhaps lose yourself in the pages of a good book at home. As night approaches, with temperatures expected to rise slightly, it is an ideal time to settle into a favorite chair or, better yet, invite a close friend over for a leisurely chat, enjoying the soothing rhythm of rain against the window. The beauty of a rainy afternoon is a reminder of the quiet joys found in togetherness, away from the bustle of the streets outside.",
