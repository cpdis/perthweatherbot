    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Downtown San Francisco basks in the gentle embrace of sunlight, with temperatures hovering comfortably in the low sixties. The sky is a clear canvas, unmarred by the usual fog, offering expansive views that emphasize the city\u2019s striking skyline and the distant Golden Gate Bridge. A light breeze rustles through the streets at around seven miles per hour, adding a refreshing element to the mild atmosphere. As the afternoon wanes, one might notice the temperature gracefully dipping to the upper fifties, invoking an inviting aura as the sun begins its descent.\n\nTonight, expect the clouds to roll in gently, creating a partly cloudy ceiling that embraces the night air, while temperatures settle into the soothing low fifties. A light southwest wind will continue to dance through the avenues, fostering a calm and relaxed evening. This is a perfect moment for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet dinner in one of the city\u2019s quaint bistros, where the warmth of good food mirrors the affectionate ambiance of the evening. Dress in layers; a light jacket would be an ideal companion for the evening chill, allowing you to fully enjoy the splendid twilight hour.",
