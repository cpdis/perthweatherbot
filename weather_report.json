    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco is shrouded in a gentle cloak of clouds, the temperatures hovering near a cool 45 degrees. A soft breeze whispers along the streets, barely perceptible at only 2 mph, creating an atmosphere that feels both intimate and expansive. As the day begins to unveil itself, the clouds will part slightly to allow patches of sunlight to filter through, meeting what promises to be a high of around 53 degrees. The West Southwest winds will pick up a little, dancing through the alleyways and along the waterfront at speeds of 2 to 7 mph.\n\nMorning commuters may wish to don layers, as the coolness lingers, particularly in shaded corners where the marine layer clings to the city. As the day progresses, one might opt for a stroll along the Embarcadero, savoring that delicate chill complemented by the fresh scent of the bay. Alternatively, a quiet visit to a caf\u00e9 in the Mission District may provide comfort and warmth while the sky shifts from gray to a pristine blue. Keep your camera handy\u2014the clarity will improve throughout the day, revealing the splendor of the Golden Gate Bridge against a backdrop of awakening city life.",
