    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives bright and uncomplicated, the sky a clean sheet with not a cloud to smudge it. Sunlight has a confident bite now and will sharpen through the early afternoon; the UV will run strong, so think brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen if you\u2019re stepping out. The air feels honest and dry, visibility crisp enough to read distant details on rooftops, and this clarity should hold through late afternoon into a gentle, golden evening. It looks like one of those mild-to-warm spring days that coaxes you outdoors without fuss.\n\nDress in light layers you can peel back, comfortable shoes, and carry water. This is prime time for ordinary pleasures: a slow amble down Rokeby Road between errands, a lunch on a shaded terrace, or a meandering walk toward Kings Park to sit and watch the light shift. Windows open at home will do good work, letting the afternoon breeze move through rooms and brighten them like fresh paint.",
