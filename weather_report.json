    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sky stretches out, painted a brilliant shade of blue, marking the transition into a season that can often shroud the city in mist. The air is cool, whispering hints of the Pacific's embrace as a gentle northwest breeze caresses the neighborhoods. With temperatures hovering around the mid-fifties, the city basks in mostly sunny conditions, granting an invitation to venture outdoors. There is a slight chill, especially as afternoon descends, reminding us of the ocean's proximity; a lightweight jacket is a prudent choice, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater.\n\nAs evening approaches, the calm will give way to a partly cloudy night, with temperatures dipping to the inviting comfort of 49 degrees. The shifting winds may stir up a sense of adventure under the twilight, ideal for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero or savoring a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s parks, where the shadows lengthen and the air cools. The potential for a marine layer lingers like a soft memory, but for now, golden rays of sun dominate the horizon, crafting a day that invites exploration and quiet reflection alike.",
