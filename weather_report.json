    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, the streets wear a thin gloss as a light rain lingers, the sky a soft, unbroken slate. Sunshine will be scarce this morning; any glow will stay muffled behind cloud, and the UV index sits low for now. The air carries that quiet, rinsed clarity that comes after a gentle night shower, though horizons will stay blurred and the day may feel slow to brighten.\n\nDress simply and sensibly: a light waterproof shell, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and something breathable beneath for when the air warms indoors. An umbrella will earn its keep. It\u2019s a good morning for unhurried rituals\u2014brew a steady coffee, read a few pages by the window, or take the early train and enjoy the soft percussion on the platform roof. If you venture out later, thread errands between drizzles and let the weather set the tempo. Sun may tease through later, but expect a subdued light and modest UV through much of the day.",
