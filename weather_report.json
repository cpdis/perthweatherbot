    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon offers a canvas of mostly sunny skies with temperatures hovering around a comfortable 61 degrees. Yet, the serene facade is masked by a looming chance of rain after five o'clock, an elusive whisper in the breeze. The west-southwest winds carry a gentle promise, subtly urging the city to prepare for the evening's embrace of a 90% likelihood of rain, as clouds gather and paint the horizon with shades of gray. Those venturing out should don layers, perhaps a light jacket to guard against the chill that descends as temperatures dip to a cozy 52, nudging upwards overnight.\n\nAs the sunset approaches, the fog may begin to weave itself through the streets, hinting at the marine layer poised to sweep in, softening the edges of the city\u2019s skyline. Walking through the streets could reveal the sweet coffee notes of a nearby caf\u00e9, an inviting stop to warm up before the rain arrives. Alternatively, a stroll along the waterfront might still fit the bill, where the shimmering bay mingles with cool breezes, making it a perfect prelude to a cozy evening indoors. Dress for the shifting moods of the day, and perhaps delay those outdoor plans until the rain\u2019s gentle tap begins.",
