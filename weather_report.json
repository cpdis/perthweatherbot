    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks into the early hours, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a cocoon of rain and gloom. The air is laden with moisture, whispering of a watery embrace that holds temperatures steady at around 50 degrees. The relentless winds sweep through the streets, harmonizing with the sympathetic pitter-patter of raindrops. A full embrace of clouds blankets the sky, obscuring the familiar silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the iconic skyline. With rainfall amounts approaching two inches, this is not the day for an impromptu stroll but rather an invitation to find solace indoors.\n\nAs Thursday unfolds, expect the rain to continue its passionate dance until early afternoon, followed by intermittent showers and the possibility of distant thunder, an echo from the nature above. Even as the day progresses, temperatures will drop slowly to the mid-50s, making it wise to wrap yourself in layers\u2014perhaps a warm sweater or a sturdy raincoat, paired with water-resistant boots to navigate the soggy streets. The ambiance may feel dreary, but within the cozy confines of a local caf\u00e9, it's the perfect backdrop for savoring a steaming cup of coffee or indulging in a good book. In such weather, why not embrace the quietude of the day? Reflect, write, or even plan your next urban adventure from the comfort of your favorite hideaway, where you can listen to the sweet rhythm of raindrops against the window.",
