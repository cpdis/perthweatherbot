    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is clean and glassy, a quiet canopy of stars and streetlamps. The air feels settled and honest, the sort that draws sound out of the night and makes footsteps seem polite. With the forecast staying clear through the small hours toward dawn, visibility will be sharp and the morning should arrive unblemished, all blue and promise.\n\nExpect a bright, sun-forward day once the light spills in; with clear skies, the UV will climb quickly and likely sit very high by late morning, so think shade breaks, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. It looks pleasant early, then a little insistent once the sun hardens. Dress in light layers now, a soft jumper if you\u2019re out, then breathable fabrics for the day. If you\u2019re awake, a quiet cup by the window or a short, reflective walk suits the hour; after sunrise, an easy stroll for coffee, a tidy of the garden, or a ride through the leafy streets before the glare peaks. By midday, retreat to a cool room, a book, and slow chores that don\u2019t mind the heat.",
