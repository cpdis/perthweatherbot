    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crispness that speaks of the approaching cold while remaining clear, revealing the city\u2019s lights twinkling like stars on the ground. The current temperature dips into the cool embrace of 46 degrees, which, accompanied by a gentle northwest breeze whispering through the streets, brings a refreshing chill that cuts through the lingering warmth of the day. Tonight, the sky is brilliantly clear, providing an unobstructed view of the celestial wonders above. There is no fog to veil the scene, nor the telltale marine layer that often surrenders to the day's end; instead, a serene calm rules the atmosphere.\n\nTomorrow promises a generous bounty of sunshine, but the coolness will persist, particularly as the afternoon drapes itself across the city. Dressing in layers will be prudent, perhaps starting with a warm sweater and a light jacket for the evening and transitioning to something more breathable for the day ahead. As San Francisco falls into the quiet rhythm of the night, it invites a slow-paced exploration. Consider a leisurely stroll through the streets, where the distant sounds of laughter from caf\u00e9s and bars mingle with the soft rustle of fallen leaves. Alternatively, a quiet moment with a good book in a cozy nook might suit the evening\u2019s calm, with the city\u2019s pulse gently thrumming outside, reminding you of the vibrant life that flourishes in this fog-kissed haven.",
