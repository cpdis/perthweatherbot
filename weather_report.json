    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a generous sun, casting a warm embrace upon the city. The air is clear and crisp, a rare blessing that allows the distant Golden Gate Bridge to stand proud against the blue expanse. The gentle north-northeast wind stirs softly, whispering secrets of the bay as it meanders through the streets. Temperatures hover near the mid-60s, offering a pleasant contrast to the coolness of the evening that will eventually descend, inviting a crisp low around 46 degrees.\n\nAs the day drifts toward dusk, the clarity remains unbroken by fog; the marine layer, typical for this coastal city, seems to hold its breath and stay at bay. It\u2019s a perfect moment to walk through the neighborhoods, perhaps to savor a cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or lose oneself in the pages of a good book while sitting in one of the parks. With the alight sun weaving golden threads through the skyline, the evening invites casual outings - a stroll along the Embarcadero or an intimate dinner with views of the cityscape. In essence, the day makes a promise of comfort and leisure, urging you to slip into a light jacket as night approaches, ensuring warmth without losing the delightfully fresh air.",
