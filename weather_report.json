    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Dalkeith arrives clear and quiet, the sun sliding low with that November gold that turns pavements to ribbon. The sky stays open, the air crisp, and visibility keen; it feels as if the day has been polished. The UV has faded to almost nothing now, and even at midday it was gentle rather than insistent, a soft kind of brightness that never quite blazed.\n\nToday has been clean and sunlit from morning through noon, and the clarity holds into dusk. It\u2019s pleasant in a simple, honest way: dry underfoot, easy light, and a quick surrender of warmth as shadows lengthen. A light coat over a jumper, a scarf for comfort, and sunglasses if you\u2019re catching the last rays will serve you well. These are good hours for an unhurried walk by the Esk, a modest errand before the light slips away, or a quiet sit by a window with a book while the sky cools to blue. Expect a crisp, uncomplicated evening.",
