    "weather_report": "West Busselton sits under a polished, blue coin of sky at midday, the light clean and unsparing. The sun has real bite now; UV is fierce through the early afternoon, and the air carries that salt-bright clarity that makes colors look freshly painted. Expect the day to stay cloudless as it drifts into mid and late afternoon, the glare softening toward evening but the horizon remaining sharp as glass.\n\nDress for lightness and shade: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a generous sweep of sunscreen; keep a bottle of water within reach. This is a good time to let the washing dry in a blink, to duck out for simple errands if you can linger in covered arcades, or to retreat into a cool room and read while the sun does its work. As the heat eases later, a gentle spin along the foreshore path or a quiet wander among peppermint trees will feel just right, and the kind of small, unhurried chores\u2014watering the garden, airing the house\u2014that pair well with a long, amber evening.",
