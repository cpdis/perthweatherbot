    "weather_report": "As the day in Subiaco fades into evening, the gentle patter of light rain from earlier has likely left a whispering echo across the streets, forming reflective puddles that mirror the dimming sky. Clouds, like a well-worn tapestry, hover above, obscuring much of what the sun might have offered in terms of warmth and brightness, leaving the air fresh and slightly cool. The day unfolds with a subdued light; it is as though the sun has taken a step back to let the rain's own quiet beauty take center stage. For those stepping outside, a light, waterproof jacket and comfortable shoes would be wise companions to embrace the drizzle without rushing. It's a scene meant for strolls under leafy canopies, where the earthy perfume of rain-soaked paths mingles with gentle laughter or introspective thought. Passersby might be inclined to seek solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, clutching a warm cup as dusk begins to settle, or wander into the hazy embrace of a bookstore where tales of adventure await. This is a day for unhurried moments, where the world slows just enough to appreciate the nuanced elegance of a rainy twilight.",
