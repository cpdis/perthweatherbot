    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle but resolute haze transforms the city into a mosaic of muted colors. The forecast presages rain after 10 AM, a reassuring reminder of the season\u2019s embrace. With temperatures lingering around 59 degrees, inching down to 55 by afternoon, the atmosphere feels cool and slightly damp, while a light breeze whispers through the streets. The sky wears a blanket of clouds, thickening with the promise of precipitation later in the day, as the spectral outline of the Golden Gate Bridge becomes softened against this ethereal backdrop.\n\nThis cool, somewhat dreary tapestry begs for a light jacket or sweater\u2014perhaps a wool scarf to ward off the chill that lingers in the air. Those venturing out might find that a cozy caf\u00e9 beckons, offering a respite from the dampness, where one can sip a warm cup of tea or coffee and watch the rhythmic dance of raindrops against the window. Alternatively, a stroll through the fog-kissed streets, with the haunting echoes of the bay, can yield a quietly contemplative experience as the city prepares for a wet evening, making today a canvas for understated pleasures and quiet reflection.",
