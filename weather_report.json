    "weather_report": "As night falls over Downtown San Francisco, the city glows under a tapestry of stars occasionally muted by the cool embrace of a north-northeast breeze. The air is crisp, with temperatures settling around a moderate 49 degrees, a chill that whispers promises of tomorrow's sunny disposition. The absence of fog invites a vibrant clarity, revealing the familiar outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge, silhouetted against the deepening twilight. \n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise to a canvas of blue, ushering in a day that promises warmth as it reaches toward a comfortable high near 60 degrees. Yet, the afternoon may bring a subtle retreat, temperatures gently falling to the mid-50s beneath the gentle caress of the north wind. In such delightful weather, layering becomes your wise companion; a light jacket over a soft sweater will keep you comfortably snug while allowing for the freedom to shed layers should the sun's rays bless you too warmly. Perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, coffee in hand, or a quiet afternoon spent exploring the city's tucked-away art galleries will perfectly match this inviting day. The brilliance of the sun would be best embraced strolls that invite discovery, the kind that reveal hidden nooks filled with the city's eclectic charm.",
