    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the familiar chill brushes the skin, whispering of the cool night ahead. With a low forecast of around 42 degrees, the softly rustling northwest winds carry a slightly crisp air, prompting one to seek the comfort of a warm sweater or perhaps a light jacket. The sky wears a partially veiled graying veil, yet the twinkling city lights spill warmth into the night, creating an inviting ambiance, even as the promise of rain looms for the day ahead.\n\nTuesday brings with it a blend of sun and clouds, the morning likely to bask in a mostly sunny demeanor before the clouds gather their resolve and rain finds its way in after the afternoon hour strikes four. With highs reaching into the low fifties, those venturing outside should prepare for the gradual dip in temperature, tucking extra layers into bags for later. The air remains clear now, with no visible marine layer to obscure views, yet the forecast hints at a change, beckoning gentle reminders of San Francisco's ever-swaying weather. A stroll along the waterfront or a quiet sit at a caf\u00e9 could prove gentle delights in the early afternoon sun, giving way to the thrilling dance of raindrops against pavements as the evening unfolds.",
