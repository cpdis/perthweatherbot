    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco awakens under a blanket of stars, punctuated by the soft glow of city lights twinkling in the distance. The air carries a crisp coolness, with temperatures retreating to around 46 degrees. As the night deepens, a gentle northeast wind stirs, whispering through the streets, promising a day that lies just beyond the horizon. \n\nBy morning, the sun will rise boldly, casting its golden rays over a city painted with hues of blue and white. The weather forecast suggests delightful clarity as it reaches a high near 60, though slightly cooler by afternoon. A promise of sun and light winds lingers in the air, hinting at a pleasant day ahead. Fog might briefly dance along the edges of the Golden Gate, receding as the warmth unfolds. Dressing in layers will be most beneficial; a light jacket will shield against the morning chill, while comfortable attire will suit the sun's embrace as the city stirs to life. Given these conditions, consider enjoying a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps pausing for a moment of reflection as you take in the beauty of the Bay, or relish a cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, watching as the city awakens, bathed in the warm light of a winter sun.",
