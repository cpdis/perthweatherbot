    "weather_report": "As the night envelopes Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cloak of cloud drapes over the city, lending the sky a muted luminescence and a chill that dances upon the skin. The temperature rests just above the forty-degree mark, underlined by a soft, north-northeast breeze that whispers against the iconic landscape. The Golden Gate Bridge and surrounding hills remain partially veiled, hinting at elusive fog snuggled within the valleys, a common companion this time of year, though the streets below are clear for now.\n\nTomorrow dawns with the promise of brighter, sunnier spells; the clouds will part to reveal a softer sun, beaming down on the city with temperatures expected to hover around sixty degrees before surrendering slightly by afternoon. While the humidity may cling to the air, offering that familiar coastal tone, the day invites simple pleasures\u2014perhaps a meandering stroll along the Embarcadero, where the rich tapestry of city life unfolds, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while observing the world bustle by. Dress simply yet warmly, layering against the chilly breeze for comfort as you embrace the adjustment into the day. Get lost in the understated charm of San Francisco as fog and sun trade places, carving another remarkable day into its narrative.",
