    "weather_report": "As the morning sun gently climbs over the horizon, Subiaco is wrapped in a tender embrace of light rain, casting a serene mist over the town. The air carries a subtle coolness, whispering softly through the waking foliage and leaving behind a glistening trail on cobbled paths. Clouds, like soft grey flannel, promise a day not defined by dazzling sunlight but rather by a wistful, introspective beauty. While direct sunlight plays hide and seek, the UV index remains low, offering a reprieve from the usual solar intensity. The droplets dance lightly upon street surfaces, evoking a sense of calm and reflective tranquility. \n\nAs the day unfolds, it lends itself to gentle pursuits. A leisurely stroll, umbrella in hand, could reveal the hidden charms tucked in each corner of this verdant enclave. Dressing for the day requires embracing its cozy ambience\u2014layers that provide warmth when the rain decides to fall liberally and a sturdy pair of boots to navigate through the sporadic puddles. Indoors beckon too, an invitation to savor the comforts of home with the soft patter of rain as a backdrop, perhaps with a steaming cup of herbal tea and a novel that offers solace in the gloom. Tasks done under such weather seem to carry an air of romance and nostalgia, a fleeting escape from the usual rush. Embrace this day with an open heart; it is a reminder that beauty often whispers rather than shouts.",
