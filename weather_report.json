    "weather_report": "West Busselton wakes in the hush before dawn, a clear sky rinsed in dark blue, the bay holding its breath as the first hint of light picks out the jetty. Expect a bright, uncomplicated day: sunrise into a clean, lucid blue with only a few idle clouds wandering in by midmorning. The sun will be generous and sharp; UV will ramp up quickly and stay unforgiving through the late morning and early afternoon, so think shade and patience at midday. It feels pleasant now\u2014cool enough for a light layer\u2014but it will warm with the day; dress in breathable fabrics, short sleeves by breakfast, and add a wide-brim hat, sunglasses, and real sunscreen. This is a morning for simple things: a quiet stroll along the foreshore as the gulls start their arguments, coffee on the porch, a bit of early gardening or a run to the bakery before the light grows fierce. Later, errands by bike or a read beneath a veranda\u2019s soft shadow will feel just right.",
