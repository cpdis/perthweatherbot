    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a soft, unbroken lid of cloud, the early light dim and pewter, the streets still rubbing sleep from their eyes. The air feels gentle rather than sharp, with little shimmer from the sun; at this hour the UV is low and, with the blanket likely to linger through the morning, it should stay muted. If the ceiling thins later, expect a quick shift to a brighter, more assertive midday where UV can bite, but for now the day is a study in quiet greys and easy contrasts, clear enough to see far yet without sparkle.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant, slightly subdued day: good for a calm start and unrushed errands. Dress in light layers and breathable long sleeves; a hat and sunscreen are a wise pocket companion in case the cloud frays. A slow walk for coffee, a gentle spin on the bike with lights, or a tidy-up of the week\u2019s loose ends would suit the tenor of the morning. If the sky brightens, consider a late-morning market run or a quick visit to the gallery; if it stays overcast, the kitchen and a pot of tea make fine company.",
