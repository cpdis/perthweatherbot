    "weather_report": "The night in Downtown San Francisco embraces a gentle shroud of clouds, a canvas for the stars peeking through to watch over the city. A chill settles in with temperatures resting comfortably around 48 degrees, accompanied by a soft whisper of a west wind. As daybreak approaches, there's a promise of a partly sunny Washington's Birthday ahead, where the sun will rise, casting a muted glow across the Bay. Expect a high near 57, with the light falling off into the early afternoon as the clouds weave an intricate dance with the sun.\n\nThe day may start under the muted tones of a foggy dawn, particularly along the waterways, where the marine layer lingers, creating an atmosphere both mysterious and enticing. Embracing layers will be key; a light jacket over a comfortable sweater should suffice, allowing for flexibility as the warmth of midday nudges the chill away. Strolling through neighborhoods or sipping a warm drink in a cozy caf\u00e9 might just be the perfect way to indulge in the day, savoring the unique calm of the city as it awakens. Let the quiet rhythm of San Francisco's streets guide you to an unhurried wander, where the charm of the city unveils itself in moments both small and significant.",
