    "weather_report": "As night slowly blankets the picturesque town of Subiaco, the weather holds a symphony of broken clouds that drape over the sprawling landscape. It's a stilled air that lingers; a languid orchestra, where celestial bodies play hide and seek amongst the tattered remnants of once formidable cloud formations. A gentle melancholy infuses the atmosphere, treading softly with grace that only a late afternoon cloud cover could administer. The splintered clouds hold their reign, reluctant to make way for the sun's elusive dances. Meanwhile, the UV index obediently bows out, yielding to the soft veils of the evening. \n\nPulling the curtains to this day would be a blend of cashmere and woolen layers, the perfect companions against the gentle coolness that shrouds. To delve into the day is to lose oneself among the fallen leaves, strolling through painted memories of the day while armed with a warm cup of tea. As the day leaves its final traces, Subiaco whispers tales of hidden conversations between the clouds and the departing sun, the best stories unfolding by the hearth, etching warmth into the canvas of the night. The essence of Subiaco on this day is an unfinished poem, as they describe, best enjoyed in the comforting embrace of a gentle chill and the company of yonder stars.",
