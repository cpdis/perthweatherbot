    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere unfurls with a muted grace this afternoon. The day begins with a gentle sun peeking through clouds, yet a chill remains palpable, as temperatures hover near the brisk threshold of 58 degrees. As the afternoon unfolds, the warmth will wane slightly, suggesting a soft embrace of the evening ahead, while a north wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it a restless energy. \n\nHowever, the calm facade belies the impending change. As night casts its veil around 10 PM, rain will tiptoe into the city, draping it in a soft shroud of gray clouds. The temperature is set to drop slightly, inviting the cool air in as the evening settles, before rising again briefly in the early hours. With a robust 100% chance of precipitation, one can almost sense the excitement in the air, as the city prepares for a wash\u2014between a tenth and a quarter of an inch gliding down from the clouds. The marine layer clings to the edges, veiling the bridges and hills, offering a tranquil yet obscured view that seems to whisper stories of hidden wonders. \n\nFor those venturing out today, layering is key; a light jacket and comfortable shoes will serve one well as the evening unveils its potential downpour. Consider indulging in a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps with a warm drink in hand, as the rain serenades the windows, or embrace the city\u2019s museums and galleries, where the foggy vistas offer the perfect backdrop for an inward journey, enriching both spirit and mind as the city awaits its cleansing nightfall.",
