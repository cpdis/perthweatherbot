A gentle breeze whispers through the streets at about 6 mph from the west, beckoning locals to bundle up a bit as they head into the night. Tomorrow promises a softer sun, peeking through the layer of clouds with a high hovering around 57. As the day unfolds, temperatures may dip slightly in the afternoon, reflecting a tranquil yet cool ambiance. \n\nWhile the horizon lacks the sharpness of a clear day, the cloud cover envelops the skyline, perhaps hiding the iconic landmarks in a gentle veil. Should you venture out tomorrow, a light jacket would be wise\u2014perhaps something cozy yet versatile, perfect for both morning strolls and afternoon errands. The subdued weather invites you to indulge in simple pleasures: a quiet coffee at a corner caf\u00e9, a leisurely bookstore visit, or a serene walk along the waterfront, where you can sip tea and feel the cool air on your face as the city breathes softly around you.",
