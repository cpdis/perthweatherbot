    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts a gentle light over the city, revealing its characteristics with a warm glow. The air, pleasantly crisp, whispers of the winter season, while temperatures hover near 60 degrees, culminating in a serene midday. A mild north wind stirs through the streets, harmonizing with the quiet bustle of daily life. However, as the clock inches towards evening, clouds will start to gather, leading to a distinct possibility of rain after 4 a.m., with droplets promising to enrich the timeless charm of this vibrant city.\n\nToday presents an opportunity to embrace the outdoors before the weather shifts. A light jacket should suffice, allowing for comfortable wandering through the neighborhoods or parks, where the sharp outlines of homes and the soft hues of the landscape prevail in clear visibility. The coastline may show hints of the marine layer creeping in, but overall, the day radiates clarity, making it ideal for a thoughtful stroll along the Embarcadero or meeting friends for coffee at a local caf\u00e9. As evening approaches, snug layers will be necessary in anticipation of the nighttime chill, which brings with it a tranquil invitation to pause and reflect, perhaps with a novel in hand as rain begins its gentle serenade.",
