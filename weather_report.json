    "weather_report": "As the sun sets over Downtown San Francisco, a comforting coolness envelops the city. The night air rests at a gentle 49 degrees, carrying with it the promise of a tranquil evening, though the sky remains mostly cloudy, softening the light from below. In the distance, the muted outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay shimmer faintly through a veil that hints at fog, creating a serene yet mysterious atmosphere. A mild south-southwest breeze stirs occasionally, whispering against the buildings, as if urging the last traces of warmth to linger a little longer.\n\nTomorrow, the day will begin with a slight chance of drizzle, a soft kiss of moisture in the morning, giving way to more resolute sunshine as the hours pass. The air will remain crisp, with temperatures ideally settling near 60 before dipping back to the mid-50s, a gentle reminder that sweater weather is still upon us. Attire best suited for this placid warmth includes layers\u2014a light jacket or cardigan to ward off the morning chill, complemented by comfortable shoes for an afternoon stroll along the waterfront. The scenery beckons curious souls to explore the quieter corners of the city, perhaps to discover a charming caf\u00e9 for an afternoon brew or to simply revel in the peaceful ambiance of a local park, breathing in the fresh, briny air while watching the clouds drift lazily overhead, intersected by rays of sunlight.",
