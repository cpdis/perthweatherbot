    "weather_report": "As dawn casts her delicate hues on Subiaco, the sky is blessed with momentary clarity, a canvas of unmarred blue whispering of serenity. By the late morning, however, gentle showers, the kind that tap lightly on windows, are expected to wander through. The sun, playful and elusive, may peek through rain-soaked clouds but won't linger long enough to warm the skin. Instead, the day carries a sense of soft introspection, as fleeting bursts of light rain suggest a mood that asks for a gentle touch, both in spirit and attire. A light jacket or a cozy sweater would be wise companions to your morning journey, brushing away the slight chill the rain might leave behind.\n\nAs the hours pass, you might find joy in quiet endeavors. A morning cup of tea beside a sun-dappled window, the rhythmic gaze of raindrops racing down the glass, or a pleasant stroll under the protective embrace of an umbrella. These moments of solace, wrapped within the day's gentle embrace, offer simplicity and comfort. As midday teases, a caf\u00e9 beckons with warm pastries, or perhaps a visit to a nearby bookstore invites a leisurely wander between its stacks. The weather invites reflection and quietude, a day best spent appreciating small delights and moments of introspective wonder.",
