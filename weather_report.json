    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is clean as glass, stars pricked sharp above quiet streets. The air feels gentle and a touch cool, the kind that clears the head; UV is essentially absent now, leaving the night unhurried and calm.\n\nToward dawn the clarity holds, and sunrise should arrive with a bright, uncomplicated blue. Expect a sunny day that grows assertive quickly after first light; UV will ramp up fast, so a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are wise once the morning gets going. Wear light layers now and shift to breathable fabrics later. It looks like a pleasant one if you move early: a quiet pre-dawn stroll, a tidy-up on the patio, or hanging the washing to catch the first sun; later, errands by foot or a short spin to the shops before the sun starts to bite. The day promises crisp visibility and a straightforward cheerfulness that rewards anyone who gets out the door before the rush.",
