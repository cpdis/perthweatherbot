    "weather_report": "Dusk slips in early over San Francisco, the sky a padded gray that mutes the edges of hills and water. Sunshine is scarce now and done for the day; the UV is essentially asleep, leaving a gentle, pewter light that turns windows reflective and makes the first slicks on pavement glow. The air feels cool and damp, the sort that gathers in collars and along cuffs, with clarity softened to a watercolor wash rather than a crisp line.\n\nRain is due to settle in this evening, arriving with a steadier hand at nightfall before easing to a quieter patter later on. It won\u2019t be a bright night, but it will be a forgiving one if you lean into it: a hooded waterproof jacket, a warm layer underneath, shoes that won\u2019t skate on wet crosswalk paint, and perhaps a small umbrella for good measure. It looks more cozy than sparkling, the kind of weather that invites small errands nearby, a slow browse in a corner shop, or heading home to put a simple pot on the stove and let the windows mist while you read a few pages you\u2019ve been putting off. If you do step out, keep it brief and companionable with the rain; the city will be quieter, the streets reflective, and the night unhurried.",
