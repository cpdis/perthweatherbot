    "weather_report": "Late afternoon settles over Subiaco with a pewter sky and that telltale hush before the first drops. Sunshine is mostly smudged behind cloud, a pale wash rather than a gleam; UV is easing with the hour, likely low to moderate now, though it had some sting earlier. The air feels mild and a little heavy, and the view down the street softens at the edges, as if the day has been wrapped in tracing paper.\n\nLight rain is due to slip in around the commute and linger into the evening, more a persistent patter than a downpour. It looks like a gentle, slightly damp night: streets shining, leaves rinsed clean, a breeze stirring but not pushing. A light layer with a rain shell, closed shoes, and a small umbrella will serve you well; sunglasses can rest. Consider ordinary comforts: a quick stop for pantry staples, a short walk under awnings between showers, or taking the train instead of the bike. At home, crack a window to hear the patter and catch up on the small tasks that never shout for attention.",
