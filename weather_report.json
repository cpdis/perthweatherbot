    "weather_report": "As the evening drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a muted haze, suggesting the approach of rain in the early hours. The chill in the air whispers of a low near 44, urging those traversing the streets to don jackets and perhaps a scarf, preparing for the inevitable touch of moisture that is soon to come. The east northeast winds, gentle yet persistent, draw in the clouds above, thickening the atmosphere with a promise of precipitation.\n\nTomorrow, the skies are forecast to remain heavily overcast, as rain descends in earnest. The high will linger around 57, with a slow retreat into the mid-50s as the day unfolds. A complete 100% chance of rain invites an indoor retreat; perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 with a book or finding solace in the warm glow of a local bookstore. With the city at its most intimate in these weathered tones, it offers a perfect backdrop for quiet reflection or hushed conversations with friends, as the marine layer swathes the Golden Gate in its tranquil embrace. Opt for sturdy footwear to navigate puddled streets; there\u2019s beauty in the soft, glistening remnants left behind by the rain, and a heart attuned to adventure might explore the quieter corners of this iconic city, unhindered by the shifting skies.",
