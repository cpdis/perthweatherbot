    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a wide, polished sky this afternoon, the air bright and uncomplicated, the sun unblinking. Forecasts keep the canvas clear through the day, so expect steady sunshine with sharp, high-contrast light and distant rooftops etched cleanly against the blue. UV will be harsh around the early to mid afternoon and then soften as the light tilts toward evening, but it remains a day ruled by sun rather than cloud.\n\nDress for radiance: light, breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; a loose long-sleeve if you\u2019re quick to redden. It\u2019s a good time to let laundry drink the light, to wander tree-lined streets for a short errand, or to claim a shaded corner of a caf\u00e9 and watch the glare slide along the pavement. Save any gardening or a longer walk for later, when the heat steps back and the shadows lengthen; until then, move unhurriedly, carry water, and enjoy the simple pleasure of a sky that asks for nothing but your squint and a moment\u2019s pause.",
