While the stars battle for visibility, the pervasive clouds momentarily cloak their brilliance, and a cool breeze whispers along the north northeast, teasing hints of dew. With temperatures settling just above the 49-degree mark, those stepping out might consider donning a light jacket or a cozy wrap, as the late-night chill carries a subtle bite.\n\nTomorrow promises a shift in temperament, with the sun striving to break through the morning veil, lifting spirits and casting a warm glow as temperatures advance towards a pleasant 62. The day will unfold beneath largely clear skies, a canvas soothingly painted in crisp blue hues that invite exploration. As the afternoon rolls in, the chill may return with a gradual dip to around 58\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to a tucked-away caf\u00e9, where indulgence in a warm drink can elevate the senses. This transition from the night\u2019s dreamlike quiet to the vibrant embrace of day sets a backdrop ideal for those seeking both introspection and connection with the beating heart of the city.",
