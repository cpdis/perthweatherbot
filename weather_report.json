    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a polished blue, the sort of clear that makes edges sharp and colors honest. Through late morning and into mid-afternoon, the sky looks set to stay untroubled, sunshine steady and unblinking, visibility crisp. Expect the day to warm quickly, the light turning a little fierce by lunchtime; the UV index will run high to very high around the middle of the day, so shade and a mindful pace are your friends.\n\nDress in light, breathable layers with a brimmed hat and sunglasses, and give sunscreen the same attention you\u2019d give your keys. A refillable bottle of water belongs in your bag. It\u2019s a fine morning for a quiet walk to a nearby caf\u00e9 before the glare peaks, a short loop of errands along the shadier side of the street, or watering the balcony herbs before settling inside with the blinds lowered. Later, if you step out again, keep it brief and unhurried; the afternoon will be bright, clear, and a touch insistent\u2014pleasant if you meet it early and mind the sun.",
