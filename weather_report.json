While the temperature lingers around a cool 48 degrees, it is set to gradually rise, but not enough to shake off the cloak of clouds shrouding the horizon. Indeed, the south wind whispers gently, yet the morning promises hints of drizzle, with skies heavy and gray, a forewarning of the 70% chance of precipitation that might drench unsuspecting pedestrians as they navigate the city's hilly streets.\n\nExpect the day to unfold in muted shades of mid-grey, with temperatures reaching a modest 62, before drifting down to a cooler 58 as the afternoon casts its softer light. The marine layer seems to linger around the iconic Golden Gate, shrouding the vista in an ethereal, damp embrace. For the discerning urbanite, layering becomes essential; a light waterproof jacket will be your firm ally, particularly paired with comfortable shoes for a stroll to the caf\u00e9 or gallery that beckons you. It would be wise to favor indoor pursuits today\u2014perhaps a visit to one of the city\u2019s many art spaces, or cozying up in a corner of a favorite bookstore. Let the world outside conspire with the elements as you find warmth and comfort in the simple joys of a San Francisco afternoon.",
