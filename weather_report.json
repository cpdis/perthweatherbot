    "weather_report": "Denmark wakes under a low, unbroken ceiling, the streets still damp from a light overnight rain. The morning will be slow to brighten; sunshine looks scarce and filtered at best, with the day likely to stay matte and subdued. UV levels will be low, barely nudging upward around midday, and the air has that soft, gray clarity where edges blur a little and everything sounds closer than it is.\n\nDress for a cool, gently wet day: a light insulating layer beneath a rainproof shell, shoes with grip, and an umbrella or hood for the passing shower. It\u2019s pleasant enough if you move with it\u2014an early bus or bike ride between drizzles, a bakery stop, tidy desk work, or a deliberate lap around the neighborhood when the rain eases. If you\u2019re out for longer, add a hat and a thin scarf; the damp, not the wind, will find you. This is weather for practical errands and quiet progress, with the promise of a calm, even-tempered day more than a sunny one.",
