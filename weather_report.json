    "weather_report": "The morning shrouds Downtown San Francisco in an embrace of steady rain, a relentless drizzle that blurs the edges of its iconic skyline. As the clouds hang heavy and low, they conceal the beauty of the Golden Gate Bridge and wash the city in a muted palette of grays and blues. The gusty south wind whispers through the streets, urging pedestrians to seek warmth and shelter from the cold spray that lingers in the air. Visibility is markedly limited, with the hills and the bay blending into a soft fog that blankets the land in its reticent hush.\n\nToday promises a continuation of this dampness, with forecasts predicting further rainfall that will be substantial throughout the day. As temperatures hover in the mid-fifties, a layered approach to dressing is advisable\u2014one might reach for a waterproof jacket over a cozy sweater, accompanied by sturdy footwear to brave the slick sidewalks. This gloomy weather invites a quieter pace, perfect for curling up in a caf\u00e9 with a good book or perhaps exploring the local library, where the scent of old pages hosts whispers of stories waiting to be awakened. As evening draws near, the rain will subside just slightly, providing a chance to enjoy a leisurely stroll under umbrellas, gathering warmth in the company of friends amid the gentle sound of rain tapping against the city.",
