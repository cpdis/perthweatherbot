The low temperature, settling around 46, beckons for a layer or two\u2014perhaps a soft sweater or a light jacket will provide the comfort needed for an evening stroll. The cool north-northeast winds whisper through the streets, a constant presence that adds a crispness, yet remains mild enough to invite outside exploration.\n\nThe promise of the coming day envelops today\u2019s forecast, poised to reveal mostly sunny skies that will rise to around 60, though the afternoon may see temperatures dip to a more modest 55. Those familiar with the rhythms of the city know this is the time of year when the marine layer tends to blanket parts of the bay in fog, especially nearer the coast. However, it looks likely that the fog will only gently touch the far edges of the Golden Gate, leaving the heart of Downtown clear and bright, ideal for taking in the fading light over the bay. With the current twilight hues playing across the horizon, a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or a quiet evening visit to one of the nearby parks might be just the way to embrace the serene San Francisco night.",
