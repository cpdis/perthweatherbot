The warmth of the day has surrendered to a low near 46, with city lights twinkling like scattered stars below. While the forecast for Christmas Day promises mostly sunny skies, the remnants of the day\u2019s light linger, inviting quiet contemplation in the crisp evening.\n\nTomorrow, expect a pleasantly mild day, starting bright and clear before giving way to a gentle cooling in the afternoon. The high will hover around the mid-fifties, and a soft northwest wind will dance through the air, encouraging light layers to keep comfortable without the weight of heavy coats. It\u2019s a wonderful opportunity to stretch your legs on a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps meandering through the Presidio to catch the sunset over the Golden Gate. With the forecasted clarity, the view should be spectacular\u2014ideal for a warm drink in hand as the local charm unfolds around you.",
