    "weather_report": "As the night gently embraces Downtown San Francisco, a mostly cloudy sky blankets the city, with temperatures eagerly hovering around fifty degrees. The soft whisper of a west wind adds a touch of coolness to the evening, creating a serene atmosphere reminiscent of a distant coastal retreat. As dawn approaches, the promise of a mostly sunny day unfolds, casting an inviting glow across the Bay, with temperatures anticipated to rise to a comfortable sixty-two degrees before settling into a crisp afternoon breeze.\n\nIn the soft light of the morning, expect the city to come alive under such a pleasant canopy. While the marine layer may lend a slight haze, it is likely to dissipate as the sun climbs, revealing shimmering vistas toward the Golden Gate and the vibrant hum of urban life. Dress in layers to embrace the fluctuating temperatures, a cozy cardigan paired with a light shirt, perfect for the mild sun and cool wind. This is a day meant for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to a local cafe, where the aroma of fresh coffee intertwines with the salty air, inviting all to linger and savor each moment in this beautiful cityscape.",
