A gentle breeze whispers from the southwest, barely stirring the city\u2019s usual rhythm. As the night deepens, the tranquility offers a moment for reflection, perhaps best enjoyed with a warm drink on a cozy terrace. \n\nTomorrow unfolds in sharp contrast; the sun will paint the morning in brilliant hues, promising a sunny day with a high near 58. As the afternoon drifts on, temperatures may mellow to around 55, but the clarity of the day is unmistakable. Light winds from the north will add a refreshing touch, creating the perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet visit to one of the city's many charming cafes. Dressing in layers will serve the day well, allowing for a comfortable transition from morning chill to midday warmth. Whether it\u2019s savoring an afternoon tea or lingering in a bookstore, the conditions beckon for thoughtful embrace of the city\u2019s offerings.",
