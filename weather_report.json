    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Bend with a clean, open sky and the last light thinning along the ridges. The sun is already low, so brightness fades quickly and the UV is essentially nil. It feels like one of those clear, easy nights where edges sharpen and distant lights seem closer. Expect the evening to stay mostly clear, with a few scattered clouds wandering in later, not enough to trouble the view or the mood.\n\nIt reads as a pleasant, quietly crisp night. Dress with a warm layer and a jacket you don\u2019t mind keeping on; a hat or light gloves won\u2019t feel out of place after dark. Good weather for unhurried, ordinary things: a short walk around the block before dinner, returning a book or two, a quick errand you\u2019ve been postponing, or stepping outside for a minute to let the stars collect themselves above the roofs.",
