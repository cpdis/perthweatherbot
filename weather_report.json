    "weather_report": "The night in Subiaco wraps around you like a soft velvet cloak as the clock ticks past two in the morning. The sky is still under the serene spell of clear weather that will gradually give way to gentle raindrops as the early hours unfold. Such delicate showers offer their own calm charm, persuading us to appreciate the restorative rhythms of nature. The day ahead promises a tapestry of gray, where moments of gentle dripping will lend an allure to what might otherwise be an ordinary Saturday morning. It's a day that whispers for simplicity\u2014a cozy mug of something warm in hand, while your feet find solace in sturdy footwear prepared for puddles. The sun may hide a little, modestly retreating behind clouds, its rays filtered gently, making hats and sunglasses an afterthought today. Even so, the world outside your window remains compelling; the soothing sound of drizzle invites you to step softly into its embrace or perhaps linger indoors, taking in the atmosphere's notably lighter mood. With weather like this, a leisurely stroll under an umbrella can become an introspective journey, or an indoor pursuit, like flipping through an unfinished novel or brewing a new tea, feels perfectly timed and oddly satisfying. Whatever you choose, Subiaco's day unfurls with a quiet grandeur that makes the small moments feel like treasures, waiting to be discovered amidst the passing rain and transient calm.",
