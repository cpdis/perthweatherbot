    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a quiet peace fills the air, the city stirring gently under a blanket of parting clouds. The temperature hovers at a crisp 44 degrees, a reminder of the night\u2019s chill, while whispers of an easterly breeze tease through the streets. Those early risers venturing outside will find the skies gradually brightening, a soft sunlight leaking through the clouds and promising a mild day. Yet, one might pause to notice the hints of fog lingering at the fringes\u2014faint tendrils of the marine layer creeping sluggishly toward the bay, obscuring the world beyond the Golden Gate.\n\nAs the hours progress, expect temperatures to nudge up slightly to a high of about 56, before gradually retreating to a cooler, more autumnal feel by afternoon. Dressing in layers will be wise, allowing for comfort as warmth radiates in the sun\u2019s embrace, only to retreat into the cozy embrace of a light jacket when the clouds wander back in. With such weather, it would be a fine day for the mundane yet appreciated: perhaps a leisurely stroll through the Presidio, taking in the sights as the city unfurls beneath the warming rays, or indulging in a spot of local coffee, savoring the gentle transitions of the day.",
