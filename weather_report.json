    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle haze wraps the morning air, tinted with the dampness of impending drizzle. The atmosphere is a subdued gray, as clouds loom above, heavy with moisture, promising a day steeped in soft, twisting winds and the occasional light shower. The high will barely scrape 62, gradually surrendering to a cooler embrace that dips to a comfortable 52 tonight. The south winds murmur through the streets, brushing past with gusts that hint at the ocean\u2019s breath, kissing the outskirts of the city with a salty tang.\n\nAs the day unfolds, those who venture outdoors might find themselves best suited in layers \u2014 a light jacket to fend off the chill, perhaps paired with a scarf that dances in the breeze. The seduction of this weather lies not in brightness but in the atmospheric richness: ideal for wandering through local caf\u00e9s, sipping warm brews while catching up on a book, or enjoying the comforting hum of conversation with friends. For the more exploratory, the dampness breathes life into the rich greenery of nearby parks, a perfect backdrop for a quiet stroll. Today, under this quilt of clouds, there lies a serene invitation to pause, reflect, and savor the intimate moments that the city offers, enveloped in its signature cool, coastal embrace.",
