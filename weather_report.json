    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is heavy with damp anticipation, heralding the rain that is set to commence after 10 PM. Shadows stretch long beneath a mostly cloudy sky, with temperatures hovering around a brisk 47 degrees. The southeast wind, gentle yet persistent at about 7 mph, carries with it the scent of the coming rain, a cool comfort against the chill.\n\nTomorrow promises a relentless downpour, compelling a retreat into the cozy confines of home or perhaps the warmth of a nearby caf\u00e9. The forecast predicts not only a high of 56 degrees but also an unwavering 100% chance of precipitation, with new rainfall accumulation bringing a soothing sound of nature's rhythm to the streets. The mist may cloak the bridges and hills in a theatrical veil, reminding us that even in gloom, there lies beauty. \n\nDress accordingly in layers; a sturdy raincoat with an umbrella in hand will shield you against the elements. As darkness unfolds, consider a thoughtful evening spent indoors\u2014perhaps diving into a good book, savoring hot tea, or even exploring the vibrant local art scene if the urge strikes you. Tonight, make the most of the city\u2019s cozy corners, embracing the warmth of indoor solace as rain rhythmically dances against windows.",
