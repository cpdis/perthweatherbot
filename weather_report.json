    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a brilliant sun, yielding a gentle warmth that nuanced the crispness in the air. With temperatures easing back to around 56, a light west northwest wind whispers through the streets, occasionally picking up to remind us of its playful nature. The sky is an expansive canvas of blue, unmarred by the fog that, as is often the case here, likes to flirt from a distance. Currently, the marine layer seems to hold sway over the ocean, particularly beyond the Golden Gate, but it has graciously left the city bathed in glorious clarity for the time being. \n\nAs evening approaches, the thermometer will drop, inviting the cool embrace of the night that settles around 46 degrees. This transition calls for a light layer\u2014perhaps a cardigan or a soft jacket\u2014against the evening chill, as you consider how to spend your time. The day still offers a window for leisurely outdoor pursuits; a stroll along the Embarcadero could reveal the sunset's gradual descent over the bay, with shadows lengthening across the cityscape. Alternatively, curling up in a cozy corner caf\u00e9 with a warm beverage could provide the perfect solace as the lights of the city twinkle on, filling the streets with a soft glow against the deepening dusky skies.",
