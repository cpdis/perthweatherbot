    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is swept clean, stars pricked across a calm, inky blue. The small hours will stay cloudless toward dawn; the air feels crisp at the doorstep, the streets hushed, and the promise of a clear sunrise already forming at the edge of things.\n\nAfter first light, expect a sunny, uncomplicated day. With no cloud to temper it, the sun will sharpen quickly and the UV will climb by late morning, so plan on shade, a brimmed hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses; start with light layers you can shed as the day warms. It looks pleasantly clear rather than harsh: good for an early amble to the bakery, watering the garden before the glare sets in, hanging a wash to dry, or walking small errands instead of driving. If you\u2019re up now, crack a window for a little cool air and set tomorrow\u2019s coffee to rights; by breakfast the light will be bright and clean.",
