    "weather_report": "In Subiaco this late afternoon, the sky is an enamel blue and the light is bright enough to cut long, clean shadows. It has been a sun-forward day and remains so; the UV index ran high and is still assertive now, easing as the sun leans west. The air feels tidy and transparent, a day of crisp edges and uncomplicated horizons.\n\nExpect the rest of the day to stay cloudless, sliding into a pale-gold evening and an open, starry night. Dress light and breathable; a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are still wise for any late errands, with a light layer to hand once the warmth slackens after dusk. It\u2019s a good hour to walk to the corner shop, tend balcony herbs, or take a slow amble through the neighborhood as the streets cool and the birds settle. If you\u2019ve washing on the line, the last of the sun will finish it; later, a quiet verandah and a cool drink will do the same for you.",
