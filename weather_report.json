    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a mild, damp night; pavement shines under streetlamps and a light shower brushes through around late evening before the sky loosens to a few scattered clouds after midnight. Sunshine is a memory now, the UV all but asleep; if the clearing holds toward dawn, first light should arrive clean and bright, with the day quick to sharpen and the UV waking briskly soon after sunrise. The air will feel washed and clear once the rain slips away, the night quietly lucid.\n\nIf you\u2019re stepping out, a light waterproof layer or a small umbrella will serve for the passing sprinkle; later, an easy cardigan or shirt is enough as clouds thin. It\u2019s a night for modest tasks and gentle pacing: a short stroll between showers to let the wet eucalyptus speak, tidying the last dishes with the window cracked to the cool, laying out tomorrow\u2019s hat and sunscreen by the door. By the time most alarms stir, the sky should be mostly open, the day ready to get on with itself.",
