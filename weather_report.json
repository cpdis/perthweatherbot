    "weather_report": "As night falls over Downtown San Francisco, a melancholic haze blankets the city, punctuated by the rhythmic patter of rain that promises to persist into the early hours. The air is thick with moisture, a familiar embrace of the coastal weather that drapes over the iconic skyline, rendering the Golden Gate Bridge elusive, hidden within the swirling shrouds of fog that rise from the bay. The gusty south-southeast winds, relentless at 15 to 18 mph, whip through the streets, carrying with them the whispers of an approaching storm. Evening temperatures sink gently around 57 degrees, inviting creatures of comfort to seek refuge indoors, perhaps engaging in a solace-inducing cup of tea or the simple pleasure of settling into a favorite book.\n\nTomorrow brings a continuation of this stormy spectacle. Rain will fall steadily, enveloping the city in a gray cocoon. The high will hover around 62, but don\u2019t expect warmth\u2014those numbers will be tempered by a drop towards the afternoon. With the possibility of an additional one to two inches of rainfall, the atmosphere reminds us to dress snugly\u2014layered jackets, good boots, and umbrellas will be vital props as the day unfolds. Given the weather's insistence on keeping us indoors, consider venturing into the cozy enclaves of local caf\u00e9s or galleries, places where the sounds of rain become not a nuisance but a backdrop to quiet contemplation and warmth.",
