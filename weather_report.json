    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of the night, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in the hushed whispers of rain showers. The city, tucked away under a blanket of clouds, stirs beneath the silver glimmers of streetlights reflecting on damp pavement. As the gusts from the south sweep through, their brisk touch carries a promise of more rain to come. The air feels alive with moisture, and the soft patter of droplets creates a rhythm, a delicate lullaby that both soothes and warns. \n\nAs dawn approaches, the forecast unveils a day accentuated by persistent rain extending into the afternoon, with temperatures unhurriedly settling into the briskness of fifty-nine degrees. The clouds linger, and although the city may begin to seep into the crisp light, the marine layer stands guard at the gates of the Golden Gate, shrouding the bridge in a spectral embrace. Such weather invites one to consider inner warmth; a cozy sweater hugged close, perhaps paired with a waterproof jacket. This dreary day resonates with the charm of indoor activities\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through the art-filled corridors of a local museum or settling into a favorite caf\u00e9, coffee in hand, while watching the world glisten through rain-streaked windows. Even amidst the damp air and swirling clouds, there lies an authenticity in the city's spirit; a hidden beauty that constantly unfurls beneath the layers of fog and mist, beckoning quiet adventure on this rainy Sunday.",
