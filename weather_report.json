    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco feels hushed under a broken quilt of cloud, the sky a soft blue-grey with the light just beginning to gather. Clarity is gentle rather than razor-sharp; edges blur a little, the way they do when the day hasn\u2019t quite decided on itself. As morning unfolds, the cloud looks set to linger, drifting in bands that let the sun through in warm intervals. Early UV will be mild, then it will build quickly once the sun lifts, so sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen make sense if you\u2019re out after breakfast.\n\nIt looks like a comfortable morning for small, ordinary pleasures: a slow walk to the bakery, a bike roll to the shops before traffic wakes, opening the windows and letting in that softened light while you water the pots or sort a stubborn drawer. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light shirt with a cardigan or thin jacket\u2014and you\u2019ll be ready if a breeze slides through. Expect a day of intermittent brightness rather than blazing sun, pleasant for getting things done without the world shouting about it.",
