    "weather_report": "Midday in Nanarup feels bright but tempered, the sun softened by a quilt of broken cloud sliding in through early afternoon. Light pools and retreats across the dunes and scrub, more dappled than dazzling. As the day leans toward evening, the cloud thins to scattered patches and the view sharpens, the horizon gaining definition and the sea turning a cleaner blue. UV under a spring sun is still punchy at this hour; it slackens later, but not enough to skip a hat and sunscreen.\n\nIt\u2019s a quietly pleasant day\u2014made for unhurried errands and small rituals. Dress in light layers with sunglasses and a brimmed hat; a thin long-sleeve will feel right when the air cools toward late afternoon. A slow walk along the shore or through a nearby reserve will suit the improving light, or potter in the garden between sun breaks. If you stay home, crack the windows and let the softened breeze wander through the rooms.",
