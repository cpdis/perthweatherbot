    "weather_report": "Late morning in Cottesloe arrives under a quilt of broken cloud, the light bright but softened so the day feels calm at the edges. Expect this dappled pattern to hold through early afternoon: sun slipping in and out, a silvered glare on the water when it breaks through, and otherwise a high, pale sky. Even with the cloud, the UV will surge toward midday; the sun bites here through gaps and gauze alike, so sunscreen, sunglasses, and a brim help. The air looks clear and clean, the horizon crisp, with a gentle sea breeze likely to gather after lunch.\n\nPleasant more than perfect. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light shirt you can roll at the sleeves, shorts or a skirt, and shoes you don\u2019t mind wandering in. It\u2019s a good morning for ordinary joys: a slow walk for coffee, errands by foot, hanging laundry to catch the moving light, a quiet lap at the pool, or tending a few plants while the sky flickers above. As the day opens up, a stroll along the foreshore or a short bike to the shops would suit the mood: unhurried, bright, and comfortably alive.",
