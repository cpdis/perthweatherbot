    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere unfolds under a tentative blanket of clouds, with a whisper of drizzle that may linger until the late afternoon. The high temperature is expected to hover around a cool 58 degrees, descending to just below 55 as the day wanes. A gentle breeze from the west hints at the tranquility of the day, but the skies remain partly obscured, casting a muted light over the cityscape. As evening descends, the cloud cover will persist, offering a low of 46, perfect for those who favor cooler nights. \n\nCurrently, the visibility appears limited, with fog threading its way through the bay, softening the outlines of landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge. The marine layer looms, particularly dense in areas closer to the water, which may deter the more sun-seeking pursuits. For attire, layering is wise\u2014a light jacket would be advisable, paired with sturdy shoes should one choose to wander across the dampened streets. An afternoon stroll at a local caf\u00e9, where one can watch the world slip quietly by, or a visit to an intimate bookstore might just be the best way to indulge in the day\u2019s charm without requiring the extravagant plea of a sunny afternoon.",
