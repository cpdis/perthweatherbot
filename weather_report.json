    "weather_report": "As the evening descends over Downtown San Francisco, a thick curtain of clouds blankets the city, cloaking the skyline in a misty embrace. Rain, persistent and soft, taps rhythmically against windows, weaving a soothing soundtrack for the night. With temperatures hovering just above 50, the air carries a damp chill, reminding all who wander outdoors to take refuge in warmth. The gusty winds from the south-southwest, at times playful, other times fierce, swirl through the streets\u2014whipping around corners with a restless energy, producing a sensation both invigorating and a little unsettling.\n\nAs the dawn approaches, the prospect of rain continues before giving way to gray, overcast skies. The temperature will modestly range in the low 60s, with a hint of sun barely breaking through the marine layer\u2019s hold. Those planning their outing should consider a light, waterproof jacket, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater, to fend off the lingering chill. With this forecast, one might find delight in the warmth of a local caf\u00e9, where steaming mugs of coffee can be paired with fresh pastries. For the more intrepid, a stroll along the waterfront could unveil the dance of raindrops on the Bay, a moment of calm amidst the city\u2019s usual hustle\u2014just the perfect backdrop for a gentle introspection or quiet conversation.",
