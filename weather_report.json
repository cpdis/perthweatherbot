    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a bright, sunny calm, inviting the city to bask in a serene clarity. The azure skies stretch endlessly above, offering a stunning backdrop as the temperature hovers around a mild 65 degrees, creating an atmosphere that balances warmth and freshness. A gentle wind whispers from the west northwest, adding a delightful touch as it dances through the palm-lined streets. The earlier fog, often a companion in these parts, has retreated, allowing the iconic landscapes to breathe freely and elegantly reveal their grandeur.\n\nAs evening approaches, the air will cool with the gradual descent of temperatures to around 46 degrees, veiling the city in a comforting embrace as twilight draws near. Layers would suit the evening's attire well, accommodating the slight chill without compromising style. As the day gracefully transitions, one might find joy in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps explore a cozy caf\u00e9, delighting in the simple pleasures that the evening brings. The charm of this day in San Francisco is unmistakable, beckoning all to embrace the beauty that surrounds them.",
