    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips past midnight under a quiet veil of cloud, the streets glossed and reflective, the air smelling faintly of wet dust. Light rain drifts in and out toward the small hours, softening edges and muting the world; stars keep their distance and the moon is only rumor. Sunshine will be scarce until at least after dawn, and the UV index is negligible now, staying low with first light and only nudging higher later if the cloud loosens. Expect a subdued, silvery morning with gentle patter and blurred horizons; more contemplative than bright, more hush than hurrah.\n\nDress for a mild damp rather than a downpour: a light waterproof or trench, closed shoes, and a small umbrella you won\u2019t mind carrying. Let the weather set an unhurried tempo\u2014put the kettle on, sort tomorrow\u2019s bag, write a note you\u2019ve been meaning to send. If you\u2019re up early, a short walk to a cafe under the awnings suits the mood, or a quiet stretch, then a tram or train to ease into the day. When the rain eases, a quick errand or a browse at the shops makes sense; if it lingers, the library and a patient to-do list will do nicely.",
