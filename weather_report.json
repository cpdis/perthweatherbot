    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a brilliant blue sky, unmarred by the usual fog that clings to the city. The sun bathes the skyline, casting a clear light on the iconic structures as temperatures hover delicately in the 50s. A gentle north-northwest breeze whispers through the streets, offering a refreshing chill that invites the early risers and the late brunch crowd alike. Tonight promises a similarly serene scene with mostly clear skies, perfect for an evening stroll, as the air cools to around 45 degrees.\n\nAs the daylight wanes, consider this an ideal moment for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, savoring the waterfront views, or perhaps a quiet visit to one of the local museums, where you can appreciate the city's vibrant cultural tapestry while remaining shielded from the brisk air. Layering with a light jacket will keep you comfortable as you navigate the early shadows of dusk; the day rewards those who venture outdoors with a sense of clarity and calm.",
