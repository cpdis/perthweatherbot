    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a curtain of cloud drapes over the city, lending a muted charm to the afternoon. The air carries a chill, with temperatures hovering just above fifty, gradually drifting downward. Although the sky appears gray, it is more a gentle pastel than a dark foreboding\u2014an atmospheric embrace that softens the edges of buildings and blurs the outlines of distant hills. The wind, a soft whisper from the southwest, caresses the skin, hinting at the coolness of the evening to come.\n\nAs night approaches, the remaining warmth will recede, and the low will nestle comfortably around forty-eight. While the cloud cover suggests the presence of fog, it does not seem to envelop the city entirely; rather, it looms nearby, fated to mingle at the waterfront as twilight falls. This weather calls for layers\u2014a light jacket accompanied by a cozy scarf, perhaps, to prepare you for the cool breeze that accompanies the evening. The day may not beg for grand outdoor adventures, but a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero might reveal the soft glow of city lights. Alternatively, settling into a caf\u00e9 for a warm drink while watching the world meander by can feel equally indulgent in moments such as these.",
