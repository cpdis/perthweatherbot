    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the early morning unfolds under a blanket of clouds, their grayish tones synonymous with the coastal whispers that weave through the city. Tonight's low settles at a cool 49 degrees, hinting at the faint breath of a south-southwest breeze, barely perceptible yet lingering in the air. As dawn breaks, the promise of a partly sunny Monday emerges, with temperatures reaching a modest peak around 58, gradually slipping to a cooler mid-afternoon 55. \n\nA delicate marine layer hovers near the Golden Gate, softening the horizon and veiling the sun's ascent. The freshness in the air carries hints of salt, a reminder of the ocean's proximity, while the winds shift to the north-northwest, teasing the city with a gentle chill. Attire should reflect this interplay of warmth and coolness; a light jacket over layered clothing would offer comfort against the briskness without feeling burdensome. Today's allure lies in simple pleasures: perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the stillness of morning mingles with the soft sounds of water lapping against the shoreline, or a charming caf\u00e9 visit to sip hot coffee while watching the city awaken under a canvas of soft clouds.",
