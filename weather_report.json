    "weather_report": "Before dawn settles into day, Centennial Park wears a damp hush. Overnight overcast and a brush of light rain have left the paths slick and the air smelling of wet leaves; the sky is a seamless gray with little promise of early sunshine. Expect the morning to stay muted and soft-edged, with occasional mist or brief sprinkles, and only a hesitant brightening later if the ceiling lifts. The sun, if it peeks through at all, will be filtered; UV levels remain low this morning and likely stay modest even at midday.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for comfort and small rituals: a light waterproof shell over easy layers, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and perhaps a cap to keep the drizzle off your glasses. Pleasant in a quiet, contemplative way rather than a sparkling one, the park invites slower plans\u2014a gentle loop with the dog while the birds fuss awake, a jog that enjoys the cool rather than fights the clock, or a thermos of coffee under a pavilion while the world takes its time. If the clouds thin later, a brief stretch on the lawn or a short photo wander to catch raindrops on branches will feel like a small reward.",
