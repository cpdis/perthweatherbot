    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a gentle glow over Downtown San Francisco, piercing through the cool air with a soft warmth that will linger until the evening. With a high hovering near a brisk 55, the day feels refreshingly clear, characterized by a bright blue sky free from the customary layers of fog that often shroud this city. You can expect a light breeze from the north northwest, brushing past in a tender whisper at about nine miles per hour, perfect for those contemplating a leisurely stroll.\n\nAs dusk descends, temperatures will dip modestly to around 42, bringing a slight chill that will rise marginally into the night. Dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater complemented by a jacket, providing comfort and warmth as you venture out. For those seeking to embrace the evening, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or a walk along the waterfront can be particularly rewarding. With the clarity of the day, the iconic silhouettes of the Golden Gate and the city\u2019s skyline will appear particularly enchanting, offering a serene backdrop for quiet reflection or time spent with cherished companions.",
