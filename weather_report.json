    "weather_report": "Late winter settles softly over Flinders Park this late afternoon, the sky a gentle sheet of pewter with only thin, pale light making it through. Sunshine is sparse and subdued; the UV is low now and falling toward negligible as day slips into evening. The air feels cool and a touch damp, the kind of gray that quiets edges and blurs the distance, leaving streets and gardens in a calm, reflective hush.\n\nLight rain is expected to drift in around dusk and linger into the night, more of a steady whisper than a downpour. Expect a mostly overcast, muted evening with poor clarity and only fleeting breaks in the clouds. A light waterproof over comfortable layers will suit the mood, with closed shoes and an umbrella for the wander home. This is weather for small, useful errands before the first spits arrive, a simple grocery run, a tram ride with fogged windows, or an unhurried loop through the neighborhood under a slow, silvery drizzle. Indoors, it\u2019s a good time for a simmering pot, a tidy of the week\u2019s paper pile, or a quiet chapter by the window while the rain writes its patient code on the glass.",
