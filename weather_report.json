    "weather_report": "This evening, Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a serene blanket of mostly clear skies, with the fading light of day casting a soft glow over the city. The air, having reached a comfortable near-59 degrees, is gentle, kissed by a light westerly breeze. As dusk deepens, the temperature will settle around 48, inviting a cozy wrap of layers, perhaps a light jacket or a soft sweater, ideal for a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet evening in your favorite caf\u00e9.\n\nThe absence of fog suggests that the marine layer has retreated for now, allowing the iconic views of the Golden Gate and the shimmering lights of the city to emerge in their full glory. It's a calm moment, perfect for reflection or leisurely exploration\u2014perhaps a walk through Golden Gate Park or a leisurely dinner at one of the local bistros. The night promises clarity and tranquility, creating an atmosphere that feels both comforting and invigorating against the backdrop of San Francisco\u2019s unique charm.",
