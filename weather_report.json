    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air feels refreshing, with a serene quietness that often accompanies the early hours. The sky is predominantly clear, painting a canvas of soft blues that suggest a pleasant day ahead. With temperatures starting around 49 degrees, it is a time that calls for a light jacket or a cozy sweater\u2014perfect for a brisk morning walk along the waterfront. Winds whisper gently from the north-northwest, creating a subtle chill that dances through the trees but does little to dampen the charm of the softly awakening city.\n\nThroughout the day, expect mostly sunny skies with a high nearing the low 60s. As the sun climbs, the chill will gradually recede, yet don\u2019t be surprised if a hint of that famous San Francisco fog sneaks in, especially as temperatures begin to fall back in the afternoon. Visibility remains clear, though, allowing for splendid views of iconic landmarks; the natural beauty of the Golden Gate will beckon you to savor its majesty, perhaps from the comfort of a caf\u00e9 with a view. Given these conditions, a leisurely stroll through the Presidio or a quiet afternoon perusal of a local bookshop would be particularly enjoyable. As you step out, the promise of a delightful day lingers in the cool air, inviting both adventure and tranquility.",
