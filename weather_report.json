    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes beneath a polished sky, the light already clean and insistent this mid-morning. Forecasts keep the canvas clear through late morning into early afternoon, so expect a day of sharp shadows and unbroken blue. It will feel increasingly bright and dry, the kind of sunshine that looks kind but carries a firm hand; UV will climb quickly toward midday and stay assertive while the sky remains bare.\n\nDress for ease and reflection: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen you actually remember to reapply. This is a good morning to run a few errands on foot before the day really gathers heat, to hang the washing where the sun can have its way, or to claim a quiet table in the shade for a late coffee and a few pages of something you\u2019ve been meaning to finish. If you\u2019re headed out later, carry water and favor the side of the street with the trees; the day promises clarity and purpose, but it asks a little respect in return.",
