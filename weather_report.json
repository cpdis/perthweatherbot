    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a polished blue, the sun already laying down clean, hard shadows and a sense that the day will burn bright and uncomplicated. Forecasts point to clear skies holding through late morning and into the afternoon; visibility will be excellent, the light crisp and a touch unforgiving. Expect strong sunshine and a UV index that surges toward very high around midday, so think shade, sunscreen, and a broad-brim hat. Dress in light, breathable fabrics, keep water at hand, and good sunglasses will make the glare more companion than adversary.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant morning for small, ordinary victories: a quiet walk to the grocer, a coffee taken under an awning, windows open just long enough to change the air before the heat settles in. Through the stark middle hours, tend to indoor tasks or a book in a cool corner, then step back out once the light softens to water the garden, post a letter, or take a short, unhurried stroll along tree-lined streets.",
