    "weather_report": "Morning in Osborne Park opens under a bare blue dome, the sunlight already white and insistent at this hour. The forecast holds to clear skies through late morning and early afternoon, a day of clean horizons and sharp-edged shadows where colors look newly painted. Expect full, unfiltered sun with a UV index rising quickly and staying very high around midday, the sort of summer light that rewards shade and caution.\n\nIt will feel pleasant if you keep to the edges of the day. Wear light, breathable clothes, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses, lay on sunscreen, and keep water close. Good hours for hanging a wash, running brief errands on foot, or tending a small garden task before the glare settles in; later, choose a caf\u00e9 table under an awning or a short stroll on a shaded path, then let a quiet room and a book carry you through the brightest stretch.",
