    "weather_report": "As the night stretches on, Downtown San Francisco lies beneath a quilt of partly cloudy skies, the low temperatures wafting in at a cool 45 degrees. The faint whisper of the South Southeast wind adds a chilling touch, stirring thoughts of warmer layers for those venturing outside. Morning is likely to greet the city with a promise that hangs delicately in the air\u2014a 50% chance of rain after 10 AM, dancing with the sun's assertive bids for brightness against the remaining clouds.\n\nAs daylight breaks, expect temperatures to rise slightly before settling back toward a brisk afternoon, enveloped in a mix of sunshine and clouds. The marine layer may cloak the Golden Gate Bridge in hues of gray, blurring the edge where land yields to sea, while elsewhere, shafts of light will pierce through. Those planning their day should dress in light layers to adapt as the sun teeters between the chill and warmth\u2014perhaps a soft sweater beneath a windbreaker for comfort amidst the changing winds and the possibility of unexpected droplets. \n\nThe city invites leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero, where the view of the Bay will be painterly\u2014in its own understated way, still worth the venture even if a hint of mist obscures the horizon. Explore the tranquility of a caf\u00e9 nook with a steaming mug, engaging in quiet introspection as the world coffee brews around you, or find a small patch of sunlight in a park for some reading, all while embracing the unique charm of a San Francisco day, ever unpredictable and perpetually enchanting.",
