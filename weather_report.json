    "weather_report": "Morning in North Perth arrives under a quilt of broken cloud, the light soft and slightly silvery, with only thin seams of sun slipping through. The day looks mild and a touch humid, the horizon a little softened, as if the edges have been rubbed with an eraser. By late morning those gaps tighten, and into the early afternoon a light rain is likely to wander in, more a persistent patter than a storm. UV should stay tempered by the cloud, but if the sun peeks out near midday it will still have some bite, so a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray. Overall, not a day for squinting; more a day of gentle greys and cool breath.\n\nDress in light layers you can shrug on and off, with a compact rain jacket or umbrella for the early afternoon, and shoes that won\u2019t mind a damp footpath. It\u2019s decent weather for small errands before lunch, a slow coffee by a window, or a short stroll between showers. If the rain settles in, let it: visit a gallery, tidy a drawer, or call someone you\u2019ve been meaning to call. The evening should feel calm and rinsed, the streets carrying that clean, rain-polished scent.",
