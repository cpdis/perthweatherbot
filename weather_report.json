    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle play of light as the sun peeks through scattered clouds, casting a soothing glow over the familiar skyline. A cool breeze rustles through the streets, hinting at the changing temperatures, where highs linger near 57 before drifting a touch lower as the afternoon wears on. The veil of marine layer lingers just offshore, retreating for now, yet the faint specter of fog remains in the bay, providing the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge framed by soft, shifting hues of gray.\n\nAs evening approaches, a calm settles in with partly cloudy skies overhead, ushering in a low around 45. The light southwest wind whispers through the city, inviting the sidewalk strollers to don a light jacket or wrap themselves in a scarf against the coolness that laces the air. It's a delightful time to wander along the Embarcadero, perhaps seeking a quiet spot to sip a warm beverage while absorbing the subtleties of the evening light reflecting off the bay. For those yearning for more activity, a leisurely stroll in one of the city's many parks could provide a perfect backdrop for contemplation, as the vibrant city hums softly around you.",
