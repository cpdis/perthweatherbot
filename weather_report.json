    "weather_report": "A thick blanket of clouds envelops Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, with rain steadily drumming on rooftops and streets, casting the day in a subdued gray. The high temperature hovers just below 60, a brief escape from cooler air that settles in as the afternoon wears on. Winds out of the south-southeast blow steadily at around 21 mph, occasionally gusting up to 39 mph, adding an edge to the dampness that fills the air. Visibility is significantly reduced; the famous landmarks, often clear, now struggle to assert themselves through the gloomy veil, with fog and rain masking their outlines. The marine layer sits heavy across the bay, a reminder of winter\u2019s approach.\n\nAs daylight wanes, the rain is expected to continue, deepening into the evening with a low settling around 55. Layers of clothing are recommended\u2014think a warm sweater over a light waterproof jacket, paired with sturdy shoes to navigate puddles. It would be best to seek refuge indoors, perhaps visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a hot drink or venturing into the warmth of a local bookstore to lose oneself in the pages of a good novel. This day, while cloaked in rain and fog, offers an opportunity for quiet reflection and simple pleasures, a moment to appreciate the city's charm, even as it hides beneath the stormy sky.",
