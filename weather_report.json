    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a thick blanket of clouds envelops the city, casting a soft gray hue over the skyline. The temperature hovers around the high fifties, offering a chill that seeps into the bones as the afternoon begins and the wind whispers gently from the west, occasionally urging the clouds to shift just a bit. As you step outside, you may notice the air feels slightly damp, a subtle indication of the moisture lingering in the atmosphere, particularly as rain may come into play later in the evening.\n\nAs dusk approaches, conditions will remain predominantly cloudy, with a chance of light rain creeping in after 11 PM. An air of anticipation lingers, where the typical vibrancy of the city is muted beneath the overcast skies. With temperatures expected to rise a touch overnight, it's wise to don layers \u2014 a cozy jacket will do well against the wind, and perhaps a scarf to guard against the coolness. Given the murky conditions, a casual stroll or a warm cup of coffee in a nearby caf\u00e9 might be just the remedy to embrace the cozy ambiance of the day.",
