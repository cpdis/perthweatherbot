    "weather_report": "As the evening drapes a cool blanket over Downtown San Francisco, the skies remain mostly clear, allowing for a glimpse of the stars that twinkle against an inky backdrop. The temperature hovers around a brisk 44 degrees, with a gentle north-northeast breeze, whispering through the streets and hinting at the refreshing chill of the season. \n\nThanksgiving Day will greet you with sun-kissed moments, as a bright, crisp day unfolds. Expect warmth to flirt with the high of 58 before gently cascading down to a comfortable mid-afternoon coolness of 53 degrees. While the marine layer may linger towards the edges of the bay, it shall mostly keep its distance, granting clarity as the sun bathes the city in golden hue. For those stepping out, layered attire will serve best; a light jacket will offer comfort against the evening's chill, while a scarf can add both warmth and style. Perhaps take a leisurely stroll through the historic streets, or enjoy a quiet evening at a local caf\u00e9, where the ambiance harmonizes with the gentle hum of the city settling into night.",
