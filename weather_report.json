    "weather_report": "A gentle chill pervades Downtown San Francisco this morning, with the day beginning under a partly sunny sky, though a thin veil of fog is just beginning to recede, allowing a glimpse of the iconic skyline shimmering with a subtle brilliance. As the sun gradually ascends, it casts a soft light that mixes beautifully with the ambient white of the lingering marine layer that clings to the edges of the bay. The expected high will flirt around 58 degrees, cooling slightly as the afternoon unfolds, inviting a sense of serene comfort rather than the bite of harsh winter chill. \n\nThose venturing outside might find a light jacket or layered attire best suited for both the brisk morning air and the warmer moments that await. Casual strolls through the quieter streets may reveal hidden corners of the city, perhaps stopping by a local caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee, or meandering through Golden Gate Park, where the landscape flourishes in muted tones under the watch of the wispy clouds above. This is a day for quiet reflections in nature or thoughtful conversations with friends, amidst the backdrop of a city slowly awakening from its night\u2019s slumber.",
