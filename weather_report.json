    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a spotless sky, the kind of lucid blue that sharpens every edge and turns windows into mirrors. The sun already has some bite; UV will climb quickly toward midday despite the easy, pleasant air, so skin and eyes will want their armor. Expect the day to stay brilliantly clear through the afternoon, the light unwavering, with a gentle sea-breeze feel later to keep things from turning heavy.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for light, breathable clothes, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a steady trickle of water. Slip on comfortable shoes and saunter to a shaded caf\u00e9 courtyard, let a late-morning coffee linger, or stroll the park paths and duck from fig tree to fig tree. Hang a wash on the line and watch it crisp in no time, or idle through the bookshop stacks and step back into the sun when the breeze stirs. Lovely, yes\u2014just remember the UV is unforgiving even when the mood is kind.",
