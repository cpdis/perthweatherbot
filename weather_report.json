    "weather_report": "After midnight, Denmark has slipped into a damp hush, the evening\u2019s broken clouds having surrendered to light rain that slicked the pavements and softened the edges of streetlamps. The sky is closed and unreflective, so there\u2019s no real hint of sun, and the UV index is effectively absent. Air feels cool and a little metallic; visibility is muted rather than murky, the sort of night that invites a quiet walk only if you don\u2019t mind the hem of your coat catching a few droplets.\n\nToward morning, the overcast is likely to linger with a chance of leftover spits of rain, so any sunshine will be shy and filtered, with the UV staying low even once the day stirs. It looks more contemplative than cheerful. Dress in light layers with a rain shell and shoes that won\u2019t mind puddles; tuck a small umbrella in your bag. For these hours, keep things gentle: empty the kettle, write tomorrow\u2019s list, or queue up a slow start. Later, run a few errands between showers, visit a museum or the library, and let the gray sky set the tempo rather than the plan.",
