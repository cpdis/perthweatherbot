    "weather_report": "The later hours of the eleventh of March sees Perth beneath an azure umbrella of clear sky, basking in the mellow rays of an earthbound sun. The day as a whole has been pure serenade, a symphony of tranquility, as the sun traced a gentle arc against the exceedingly clear sky, beaming the energy that saw all life spring from humble origins. Yet, it's an inviting paradise as the UV index remains at sea level, friendly to all life fluttering under its benevolent gaze. It's become a day to slip into linen or lightly colored cotton attire to reflect the yet warm rays away, making the most of this balmy window before twilight. Perhaps one might wash the dust off the little-used garden furniture, once again inviting it to partake in nature's merriment, or indulge in a leisurely stroll across the path strewn with specks of gold falling from the setting sun. \n\nAs twilight crawls in, pulling along a blanket of stars, don't be tempted into leaving the dreamy outdoors for the indoors just yet. Take a light jacket to ward off the minor chill prowling around, and with your favorite book in hand, settle into your veranda chair and let the indigenous nocturnal symphony serenade your evening while you ride the landscape of your literature beneath the soft luster of the moonlight.",
