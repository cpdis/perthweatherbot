    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a quilt of cloud, the light thin and pewter-toned, with the scent of damp pavement in the air. Expect light showers to settle in from late morning through early afternoon, keeping the day subdued and softly blurred at the edges. Sunshine will be shy; the UV feels toned down by the overcast, though a brief midday break could still carry a quick nip. The day reads as gentle rather than bleak\u2014more a soft drumroll of rain than a downpour\u2014so visibility stays fine, just softened by veils of passing showers.\n\nDress for the in-betweens: a light waterproof jacket over breathable layers, comfortable closed shoes, and a compact umbrella tucked in a bag. It\u2019s a good morning for small, unrushed errands, a browse along the covered shopfronts, or a quiet pause with a late breakfast by a window while the showers tick past. If you\u2019ve plants to repot, the balcony or carport will do nicely between sprinkles; later, a stroll when the rain eases will feel clean and calm, the streets washed and reflective.",
