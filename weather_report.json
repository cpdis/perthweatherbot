    "weather_report": "After an afternoon and early evening of light rain in Katy, the night has settled into a damp hush. Streets wear a soft sheen, clouds hang low and unhurried, and any hint of sunshine is long gone until after dawn. UV is negligible now; the sky feels muted rather than menacing, the air rinsed and a touch sweeter for it, though clarity is limited by that quilt of cloud.\n\nIf you step out, a light waterproof jacket and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles will serve you; carry an umbrella if you like keeping your edges dry. It\u2019s a night for small, ordinary comforts: fold laundry while the house hums, jot a list for tomorrow, let a kettle whisper and unwind with a chapter or two. Expect the rest of the night to remain mostly cloudy with the possibility of a lingering sprinkle, and a subdued start when morning arrives rather than anything bright or bold.",
