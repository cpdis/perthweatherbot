    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco wears a soft, pewter light; the breeze has that hushed, rain-on-the-way promise. A light shower is due around the next hour, then the sky loosens into broken cloud after dusk, perhaps a thin, late glow if a gap opens on the western rim. Sunshine is mostly veiled and gentle, the UV now low and losing interest as evening approaches. The day feels rinsed rather than bright; edges are softened, visibility still good, pavements likely to glimmer a little.\n\nA light waterproof or windbreaker over breathable layers will serve, with comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind a damp footpath; tuck a small umbrella in a bag. It\u2019s a good window for an unhurried grocery top\u2011up, a quiet browse at the returns shelf, or a loop through the neighborhood between showers, listening to the soft rattle of drops in the jacarandas. If you\u2019re cycling, lights and a modest pace will keep things civil. At home, crack a window for the cool, clean air and let the evening settle in while you put a pot on and sort tomorrow\u2019s list.",
