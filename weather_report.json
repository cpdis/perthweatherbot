With the temperature settling around a crisp 46 degrees, there\u2019s an invitation to bundle up a bit tighter, perhaps wrapping yourself in a snug sweater or light jacket to ward off the chill. As the day unfolds, the promise of partly sunny skies makes its entrance, peeking through the layers, while gentle winds whisper at a calm 2 to 7 mph from the west. \n\nAs you glance at the horizon, the city appears both hazy and welcoming, with the marine layer still lingering along the coasts\u2014ghostly tendrils possibly clinging to the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, softening its silhouette against the backdrop. The high today will flirt with 55 degrees before retreating to a more comfortable 52 in the afternoon, making it a day well-suited for a leisurely stroll through the quieter streets or perhaps a stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor the warmth of a freshly brewed coffee. While the fog hangs in quiet moments, it also invites a sense of calm, presenting a perfect backdrop for reflection or unhurried conversations with friends. Embrace the understated beauty of the day; the city has secrets to share if you\u2019re willing to wander.",
