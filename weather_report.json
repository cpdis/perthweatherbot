    "weather_report": "Northbridge settles into a hushed evening after a day that opened wide and sunny, the afternoon polished to a clear gloss before a band of scattered clouds wandered in toward dusk. The sky now is mostly open and quietly reflective, with the moon and a few brave stars slipping through the gauze. UV is no longer a concern; earlier it would have been modest at best by midafternoon and then swiftly fading. The air feels clean and steady, the kind of night where sound carries and porch lights seem warmer than usual.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant, unhurried stretch ahead. A light jacket or soft sweater suits the hour, with comfortable shoes if you\u2019re inclined to take a slow loop around the block or walk the dog beneath the thin cloud cover. Otherwise, this is good weather for small, useful rituals: stepping outside to breathe between chores, a cup of tea on the stoop, tidying tomorrow\u2019s bag, or a short errand before settling in.",
