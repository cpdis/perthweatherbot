    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco; after a clear late afternoon, thin clouds have wandered in and softened the first stars. The air is clean and steady, visibility crisp, and the day\u2019s glare has slipped away. Sunshine is done for the night, of course, and the UV has faded to almost nothing; what remains is a calm, lightly veiled sky and a sense of ease.\n\nIt feels quietly pleasant rather than bracing, the sort of night that suits unhurried errands and small comforts. A light jacket or soft sweater is enough, with a scarf if you run cool. Expect the sky to stay mostly cooperative, with a few clouds drifting by and not much else. Good hours for a slow walk along familiar streets, watering the balcony pots, or a gentle spin on the bike before settling in. Open a window, let the mild air move through the rooms, and finish the day at a humane pace.",
