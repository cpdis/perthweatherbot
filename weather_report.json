    "weather_report": "As the night enfolds Downtown San Francisco, a gentle chill hangs in the air, invoking a quiet introspection that seems to settle on the city. The temperature drifts down to a cool 46 degrees, but rises just slightly as the hours roll by. The subtle hum of the southeast wind brushes through the streets, a mere whisper between buildings, almost unnoticed against the backdrop of distant lights winking like stars trapped in glass. \n\nTomorrow greets the day with promise; a light haze lingers in the early morning, giving way to a sun that promises to warm the neighborhood. With a high near 62, the sky will adopt a clearer disposition as wisps of haze fade away, revealing the charm of this urban landscape beneath the brightening blue. As afternoon approaches, temperatures will delicately recede to a cooler 58, wrapped in the embrace of a light northeast wind. \n\nIn such a setting, dressing in layers would be prudent\u2014a cozy sweater or a light jacket would provide comfort against the evening's chill, while breathable fabrics will suit the mild daylight hours ahead. As you step into the morning, consider a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the waterfront offers a soothing escape. Perhaps indulging in a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 followed by a stroll through one of the city's tranquil parks would be an ideal way to soak in the rich atmosphere of this beautiful city.",
