    "weather_report": "As dawn envelops Subiaco, the remnants of an overnight drizzle linger like a distant memory, leaving behind a gentle sheen on the cobblestones and a whisper of coolness in the air. The sky, a canvas of muted greys interspersed with tentative hints of warmth, suggests a subdued start with light rain recently gracing the early hours. The day ahead, though largely absent of strong sunlight, promises periods of softness where the clouds may thin and the light rain finally abates, casting an ethereal glow in scattered moments. The afternoon may find the skies parting intermittently, teasing with brighter prospects and a modest UV index that allows for brief strolls without the armament of sunhats and sunscreen. \n\nFor now, a cozy embrace of a light sweater or a trusty raincoat seems apt\u2014a subtle barrier against any remaining droplets or breezes that might whisper their way through. Despite the dampness, the air carries a fresh vibrancy\u2014a perfect accompaniment for meandering walks through local parks or enjoying a languid coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9, the rich aroma mingling with the scent of wet earth. This muted weather, offering a gentle nod to introspection, is tailor-made for leafing through the pages of a book in a corner nook or perhaps jotting down thoughts inspired by the city's ever-shifting skies. As the day unfolds, cherish its soft rhythm and the quiet beauty lurking between the drizzle and the breaks of gentle light.",
