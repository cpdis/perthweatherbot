    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds hugs the city, promising a gentle embrace rather than an oppressive shroud. The temperature rests at a comfortable 52 degrees, accompanied by a gentle west wind that whispers through the streets. With morning's approach, expect a slow transition; while the day might awaken mostly sunny, the late afternoon holds the likelihood of rain creeping in after five. The forecast hints at a playful dance of fleeting sunshine and encroaching clouds, settling into a high of around 62 before falling back to the chilling embrace of evening.\n\nWhile fog remains at bay for now, the bay's ever-present moisture hints at the potential for a marine layer to roll in, transforming the landscape if the winds shift. Dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater with a sturdier jacket at the ready, especially if you're planning to traverse the city in the late afternoon or evening when showers may grace the streets. Given the evolving conditions, a leisurely walk along the waterfront could be delightful, or perhaps a cozy afternoon at a caf\u00e9, warming yourself with a cup of coffee as you watch the clouds above. Such moments embody the essence of San Francisco: unpredictable yet beautiful, always alive with stories waiting to unfold.",
