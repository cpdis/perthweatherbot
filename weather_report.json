    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco reveals a delicate interplay between sun and the remnants of morning fog. While the fog is retreating, hints still linger near the edges of the bay, merging softly with the coastal horizon. The skies are mostly sunny, but a cool breeze dances through the city, wrapping the streets in an invigorating chill that invites a light jacket or a warm sweater. As the temperature hovers around a brisk 55 degrees, the atmosphere feels fresh, the light crystalline\u2014a reminder that even in the serenity of winter, the sun has its charm.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the clouds will part even further, giving way to a partly cloudy night, lingering at a low of around 49 degrees. Temperatures will dip, so layering will be wise as the north-northwest winds bring a gentle bite, gusting at times to a brisk 25 mph. This is a splendid day for a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sea breeze can inspire a contemplative moment or a quiet coffee break at one of the waterfront caf\u00e9s. Perhaps take a leisurely jaunt through the Presidio, where the golden light of the setting sun illuminates the iconic bridge, offering a picturesque end to a day that dances between the mysterious call of the fog and the warm embrace of the sun.",
