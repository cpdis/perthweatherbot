    "weather_report": "As the night whispers its gentle farewells, Downtown San Francisco finds itself wrapped in a comfortable embrace of clarity, the stars twinkling above like a celestial audience. The temperature drifts downwards toward a brisk 42, inviting a cozy layering of fabric as the North wind, modest at 6 mph, adds a whispering chill to the air. Early risers or nocturnal souls peeking out into this transient stillness will behold a generous view\u2014mostly clear skies punctuated by the soft shimmer of city lights, free from the clutches of fog or a marine veil.\n\nAs day breaks over the city, a sun-drenched Sunday unfurls. With a high near 55 waiting to be disclosed, the radiance will eventually cast shadows that flirt with 53 in the gentle afternoon. The air is fresh, invigorating, suggesting a stroll through the quieter streets or a visit to the bustling farmer\u2019s market. For those who crave moments of leisure, why not enjoy a homemade brunch, savoring simple delights as sunlight pours through wide windows? Pair this with layers that can transition from the nippy morning chill to a pleasantly warm afternoon, and enjoy the day\u2019s gradual metamorphosis into a pleasant, sunlit tapestry of urban life.",
