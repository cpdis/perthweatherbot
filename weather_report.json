    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a cool, crisp air envelops the city, whispering promises of a serene day ahead. The low temperatures have settled in around 46 degrees, a gentle precursor to the promising warmth that will creep in later this morning. The sky is partially cloaked in clouds, with hints of sunlight peeking through the shroud, nudging the mercury upward as it heads toward a high of 56. The northwesterly breeze, mild and unyielding at approximately 7 mph, adds a refreshing touch, perfect for those early risers embarking on a Sunday adventure.\n\nVisibility is clear but infused with that signature San Francisco charm; patches of fog linger over the bay, particularly near the Golden Gate, where the marine layer dances in and out of sight. The atmosphere carries a gentle glow, hinting that the sunny spells later today will be inviting for strolls along the waterfront or a leisurely morning coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where the crisp air can be savored. For those venturing out, layering becomes essential\u2014perhaps a light sweatshirt paired with a jacket to fend off the coolness, complemented by comfortable shoes for wandering the city\u2019s vibrant streets. It\u2019s a lovely day to step into the fresh world outside, as long as one is prepared to embrace the playful fluctuations of San Francisco's weather.",
