    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco settles into the evening, the air carries a crisp clarity, reminiscent of the kind of night that feels both invigorating and serene. With a current temperature hovering around a comfortable 52 degrees, the northwest winds lend a playful chill, whispering through the avenues and wrapping the skyline in a gentle embrace. Tonight, without a hint of fog or perhaps just a soft marine layer lingering along the edges, visibility remains unobstructed, creating a picturesque canvas where the lights below glisten like stars fallen to Earth.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of sun welcomes the day with a soft glow, temperatures nudging towards a pleasant 68 in the afternoon, then retreating slightly to keep the day feeling refreshingly mild. The north-northwest winds will dance around, strong enough to ruffle the leaves but not enough to discourage a leisurely stroll. For those venturing out, layering light and breathable fabrics will be ideal; a light jacket could serve well against the breezy undertones as you map out a day filled with simple pleasures. Perhaps a quiet morning coffee at a local caf\u00e9, followed by an amble through one of the nearby parks, where the autumn colors create a backdrop deserving of a quiet moment. This is a day to embrace the outdoors, to imbibe the beauty of a sunlit city with every step you take.",
