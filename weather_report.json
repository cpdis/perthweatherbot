    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, a tranquil atmosphere prevails under a mostly clear sky, with cool breezes whispering through the streets. The temperature dips to a crisp 43 degrees, inviting a sense of calm and reflection, perfect for a quiet evening stroll or a cozy gathering indoors. As midnight approaches, the city lights twinkle like stars, creating a dreamy backdrop for those lost in thought or conversation.\n\nLooking toward Tuesday, the sun promises to grace us with brilliance, bringing a daytime high near 55 before easing into the early afternoon's gentler embrace of 52 degrees. The north northwest winds, a gentle reminder of winter\u2019s hold, will be mild, making it a splendid day for a leisurely outing. While fog may often sweep across the bay, tonight appears free of its embrace, leaving San Francisco\u2019s iconic skyline clear and inviting. As you prepare for your day ahead, consider layering up to adjust comfortably to the shifting weather, a light sweater over a long-sleeve shirt would suffice as the brisk chill dances between the sun\u2019s moments of warmth. A stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps followed by a visit to your favorite local caf\u00e9, would perfectly complement the unpretentious charm of this winter day.",
