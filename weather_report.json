    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of anticipation wraps the city in partly cloudy embraces, the temperature gracefully hovering around a cool 45 degrees. The gentle northwest wind whispers through the streets, a subtle reminder of the chill in the air, perfect for cozy layers. The moonlight dances off the buildings, lending a serene glow to the urban landscape.\n\nTomorrow promises a notably brighter scene with mostly sunny skies. The day will unfold in a kind invitation to step outside, with temperatures climbing to around 54 degrees, then softly retreating to 52 as afternoon approaches. The northeast winds will be mild, almost absent, allowing for leisurely strolls through the rejuvenated neighborhoods, perhaps a visit to an inviting cafe or a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero where the Bay's beauty remains a constant. With the absence of dense fog, one might even find a moment to gaze at the Golden Gate Bridge, framed by a clear canvas of blue. As the sun sets, the chill of the evening will creep back in, so a light jacket or a knitted scarf will offer warmth as the city sparkles under its nightly glow.",
