    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere wraps itself in a shroud of gray as rain taps gently on city streets, weaving a soft melody that mingles with the whispers of the wind. The day showcases a steady descent in temperature, settling into the realms of cool that invite the cozy embrace of a light jacket or an umbrella, both of which serve as allies against the persistent dampness. Amidst the city\u2019s iconic silhouette, the usually clear views toward landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge are subdued, overshadowed by low-hanging clouds and the lingering threat of fog, which is never far in this coastal enclave.\n\nAs evening approaches, the rain continues, maintaining an 80% chance of further precipitation, with the scent of wet earth filling the air, offering a moment of reflection in the midst of the hustle and bustle. Ideal activities might involve curling up with a good book in a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm beverage while watching the raindrops dance against the windowpane, or perhaps a leisurely stroll through a covered ark, where the rhythm of the rain softly accompanies one\u2019s thoughts. Embracing the tranquility of this rainy day, one might find solace in the simple beauty of the moment.",
