    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a veil of fog stretching along the coastline, brushing gently against the Golden Gate. For now, the air is cool, with the fog expected to dissipate, revealing its bright, blue-skied counterpart by midday. The gentle north wind adds a crispness to the chill, transforming the experience into something tranquil yet invigorating. By the afternoon, as temperatures slide back towards a comfortable 54, the sun will cast a warm light over the city, inviting residents to embrace the day.\n\nGiven the moderate temperatures and partly cloudy skies anticipated tonight, those stepping outside may want to bundle in layers; a light jacket should suffice for the morning chill, while a short-sleeve shirt could herald the impending sun\u2019s embrace. As day slips into evening, the atmosphere remains refreshingly pleasant\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll through neighborhood parks or a casual caf\u00e9 visit to savor a warm drink. The art of indulging in the understated beauty of this fog-kissed city lies in recognizing its intimate charms, offering a reprieve on a day both calm and serene.",
