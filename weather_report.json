    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle sun filters through a veil of high and scattered clouds, creating a mood that oscillates between brightness and a lingering haze. Though the thermometer hovers near 54 degrees, hints of the chill settle in as the afternoon wanes, with temperatures gradually retreating to around 51. The westward breeze whispers softly, encouraging momentary warmth against the coolness that can sneak in at this hour. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the clouds will thicken, offering a preview of tonight\u2019s enveloping gray as the temperature dips to approximately 45 degrees. Fog has yet to fully embrace the city, but the subtle presence of the marine layer dances along the horizon, teasing the Golden Gate and pushing gently over the bay. For those venturing outdoors, layered attire is recommended; a lightweight coat paired with a comfortable sweater would do well to combat the crisp evening air. Spend the remainder of the day wandering through the city's quieter alleys, perhaps indulging in a cozy caf\u00e9, or savoring the simple pleasure of a walk along the Embarcadero as the city transitions from day to night, inviting a moment of tranquility among the fleeting hustle.",
