    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Perth wears a clear, glassy sky like a pressed shirt, the sun sliding lower yet still bright enough to sharpen edges and turn windows to small fires. It\u2019s been a sunny, open day and remains so; visibility is crisp, colors are honest, and the air feels clean. UV has eased from its midday sting but still asks for some respect until the sun kisses the horizon. Shadows grow long, the heat loses its bark, and the city hums with a patient, even light.\n\nExpect the evening to stay cloudless and settle into a pleasant, gentle cool. Light, breathable clothes suit the hour; keep the hat and sunglasses handy for a little longer, and carry a soft layer for later. It\u2019s a good time for small errands on foot, watering the garden, giving the car a lazy rinse, or riding a bike along quiet streets just as the sky tilts toward gold. Supper outside, a book on the balcony, windows open to air the rooms\u2014simple things that match the calm.",
