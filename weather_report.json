    "weather_report": "As the clock nudges past the two-hour mark in the morning, Subiaco stirs under a sky weeping gently with rain. It's a soft, almost meditative drizzle, smoothing the edges of the night's sharpness into a misty tapestry. With clouds forming a comfortable quilt overhead, the sun slumbers behind grey sheets, unlikely to paint the day with its golden hues. One imagines the UV index would remain low, allowing skin to breathe without fear of burning, yet the dampness clings like forgotten dreams. Clarity feels like a distant notion, with the rain whispering on leaves and car windows, inviting a slower pace.\n\nEmbrace the comfort of layered clothing today, choosing textures that revel in moisture, like light knits and sturdy boots. An umbrella becomes less a shield and more a companion, sharing the intimacy of the droplets that grace your path. Perhaps this is a day to revel in indoor pursuits that echo the contemplative mood set by nature. Wander through the pages of an unfinished book, ponder over a fine tea's aroma or find solace in the quiet hum of a caf\u00e9, where the rain provides a percussion that pairs perfectly with coffee steam. The world may be weeping, but in this rain lies a beautiful refrain of stillness, inviting reflection and gentle appreciation.",
