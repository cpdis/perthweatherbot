    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a steady drizzle signals the onset of what promises to be a rather dreary yet characteristically enchanting day. The clouds, thick and impenetrable, blanket the city like a heavy quilt, with temperatures hovering around a cool fifty-two degrees. The whisper of wind from the southeast carries with it the unmistakable scent of rain-soaked earth, rustling through the city streets. Visibility might be limited, with mist swirling in from the ocean\u2014traces of the marine layer subtly seep into the urban landscape, giving everything an elusive quality.\n\nThroughout the day, the persistent rain is expected to continue, gracing the city with up to an inch of new moisture, reminding us that even in its gloom, San Francisco holds a certain allure. For those venturing outside, dressing in layers is wise; a waterproof coat will serve you well as the winds may pick up, gusting up to thirty miles per hour. A cozy scarf could provide comfort against the damp chill. In this weather, it might be the perfect time to seek refuge in one of the many charming caf\u00e9s that dot the streets, perhaps indulging in a warm drink while watching the world glide by, blurred yet beautiful in the rain. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, a stroll through the fog-shrouded alleys of the city, where each step brings an intimate connection with the essence of San Francisco, could lead to delightful discoveries.",
