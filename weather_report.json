    "weather_report": "As the clock quietly ticks past 2:10 AM in Subiaco, the sky is draped in a thick, comforting quilt of overcast clouds, with a gentle sprinkle of rain expected to follow. The dense cloud cover makes for a more introspective kind of day, one where the sun seems shy, casting not its usual bold glare, but rather a diffused, muted glow. The clarity of the day is dimmed, urging the town to momentarily pause, introspect, and relish in the embrace of a cloak of soft grayness. This isn't a day for vibrant hues or the energetic warmth of ultraviolet rays; rather, it's a day designed for quiet reflection, cocooned in the coziness of a beloved sweater or a light waterproof jacket.\n\nAs the light, cooling rain sprinkles from the heavens, Subiaco finds itself perfectly primed for gentle pursuits. Layered attire is advised, favoring comfort and practicality over style or formality. Imagine spending the morning at a quaint local caf\u00e9, steaming mug in hand, or perhaps indulging in a quietly adventurous exploration of hidden art galleries or enveloping yourself in the pages of a trusty novel. In such serene conditions, mundane activities become elegant in their simplicity. The soothing patter of rain provides a melody to accompany the rhythm of a day colored by introspection.",
