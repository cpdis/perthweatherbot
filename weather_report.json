    "weather_report": "The skies above Downtown San Francisco are cloaked in a thick, mottled gray, hinting at the day's cooler embrace. As the afternoon drifts toward evening, temperatures hover near 57 degrees, with a soft southwest breeze stirring the clouds. There's an unmistakable presence of the marine layer, inching closer to the city, shrouding the Golden Gate in a spectral veil that speaks of impending drizzle.\n\nTonight, the likelihood of rain flirts with the evening hours, presenting a nuanced dance of moisture that may tease the rooftops of the city, especially between the fleeting hours of 9 PM and midnight. Those venturing out this evening will want to wrap themselves in layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a sweater, accompanied by a sturdy pair of shoes, should the streets turn slick and an unexpected shower arrive. As you wander amidst the shimmering city lights reflecting off the bay, consider spending your evening cozying up inside a local caf\u00e9, savoring the warmth of a steaming drink while watching the clouds play their mysterious game overhead, or perhaps revisiting a favorite book under the soft glow of a lamp.",
