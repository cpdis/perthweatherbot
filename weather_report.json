    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into night under a flawless, ink-blue dome, the air steady and untroubled. Sunshine is gone from the stage and the UV has fallen to almost nothing; the forecast holds to clear skies through late evening and after midnight, so the night should stay transparent and quiet. The scene feels clean-edged and pleasant rather than chilly, the sort of clarity that makes streetlights look crisper and sound carry a little farther.\n\nLight layers will serve you best: a tee with a cardigan or a thin jumper if you\u2019re out, easy shoes for an unhurried loop around the block. With the sky so clean, it\u2019s a good evening to water the garden, sit on the veranda with a chapter or two, take out the bins, or tune a bike chain for tomorrow\u2019s ride. If the clear spell lingers into morning, expect bright sun in short order, but for now the UV rests.",
