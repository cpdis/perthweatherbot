    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco is washed in golden clarity, the sky a clean pane of blue without a stitch of cloud. Sunlight still has some edge, though the UV index is easing now and will slip toward low as the sun drifts down; a hat and sunglasses remain wise if you\u2019re out before dusk. The forecast holds steady and simple: clear through the early evening, then a gentle, transparent night.\n\nIt feels like a pleasant day exhaling, warm light mellowing into comfort. Dress light and breathable, keep the shades handy, and carry a soft layer for after dark when the air cools under the open sky. This is good weather for modest errands and quiet pleasures: a stroll to pick up something for dinner, tending balcony herbs, a lazy loop around the block on a bicycle, or reading on the veranda while the light turns honeyed and the streets unhurried.",
