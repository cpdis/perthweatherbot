    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Downtown San Francisco, the air is imbued with a soft chill, bringing a crispness that encourages warmth. The night sky is mostly clear, stretching out into an infinite expanse, with only the faintest hint of cloud on the horizon. With ambient temperatures hovering around a low 42 degrees, the gentle south-southwest breeze caresses the skin at a leisurely pace, whispering of an awakening day ahead. \n\nThe forecast for Tuesday promises a sunlit reprieve, with a high close to 56 degrees that gracefully dips towards a cooler afternoon. As the sun rises, it will light up the city, bestowing clarity that will briefly chase away any lingering fog or the soft marine layer that often embraces this coastal city. For those planning their day, layers will be your allies. A cozy sweater or light jacket will serve well against the cool morning air, and as the day warms, a simple t-shirt might suffice for a stroll along the piers or a delightful caf\u00e9 visit. Seize the opportunity for a reflective walk through the quiet streets, perhaps indulging in the aroma of coffee and fresh pastries, or finding a park bench to relish a moment of tranquility amid the city's gentle evening serenade.",
