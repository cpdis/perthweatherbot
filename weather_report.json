    "weather_report": "Ocean Beach settles under a quilt of cloud just past midnight, the surf sounding larger than it looks, the horizon smudged into charcoal. After an afternoon that loosened from overcast into broken cloud, the night keeps its soft lid on the sky; starlight comes and goes, the air feels a touch damp, and the world is pleasantly hushed. Sunshine will be scarce when day returns, more a muted wash than a beam; UV is negligible now and likely to stay low, nudging only to modest if a brief clearing drifts through. Expect a day of softened edges and gentle light rather than glare, with visibility a little gauzy near the water.\n\nDress in light layers, a windbreaker or soft sweater you won\u2019t mind catching a bit of ocean mist, and shoes that forgive sand. For now, a short, meditative walk along the promenade or a warm drink by a cracked window suits the hour. After sunrise, think small, comfortable errands: a coffee and a quiet look at the tide line, a neighborhood bike loop between cloud breaks, reading by a window, or sorting a few neglected drawers while the sky meanders between pewter and pearl.",
