    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the night, Downtown San Francisco embraces a crisp clarity, untouched by the usual shrouds of fog. With temperatures hovering around the refreshing 47 degrees, the calm is punctuated only by a gentle north northeast breeze. As morning yields to the sun's welcome ascent, expect a canvas painted in brilliant blue, tantalizingly warm, and reminiscent of spring's first blush. The high will flirt with 62 degrees but dip into a cooler embrace by afternoon, settling around 58 as the sun\u2019s enthusiasm wane in the fading light.\n\nDressing for this day calls for layers, combining a light sweater with a versatile jacket for the morning chill, easing into comfortable attire for the sunlit afternoon. A stroll through the lush paths of Golden Gate Park or a visit to one of the city's quiet coffee shops presents a perfect opportunity to relish the bright atmosphere and the invigorating breeze. This day invites exploration, a chance to take in the vibrant life of the city as it awakens, without the constraints of a heavy fog.",
