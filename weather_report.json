    "weather_report": "As the night settles softly over Downtown San Francisco, the current atmosphere reflects a tranquil, partly cloudy canvas adorned by a hint of a cool breeze. The temperature hovers around a gentle 50 degrees, with a subtle rise anticipated as the evening deepens. A refreshing north-northeast wind carries whispers through the streets, playfully nudging the air at speeds reaching 20 mph, creating an inviting chill that encourages layered attire.\n\nCome Wednesday, the city is poised for a sun-kissed awakening, where radiant beams are expected to brighten the landscape, lifting the high to a comfortable 62 degrees by midday. As the sun arcs across the sky, temperatures will gradually retreat to a blissful 58 in the afternoon, fostering an atmosphere that feels both uplifting and invigorating. While the day may start off with clarity, the presence of fog lingering near the coast may briefly obscure views of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, adding an element of mystique. Dress in light layers to embrace the daytime warmth while remaining prepared for the capricious winds that might bring a delightful nip to the air. Given the lovely forecast, an amble along the waterfront or an exploration of the diverse neighborhoods offers a splendid way to savor the pulse of the city, inviting all to discover the whimsies of a San Francisco winter day.",
