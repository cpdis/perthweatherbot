    "weather_report": "Perth Airport slips into a cool, damp evening, the last light long gone and the runway lamps wearing soft halos. Clouds are thickening, the sky a slate lid with barely a seam, and the day\u2019s sunniness is over; UV is essentially nil now. The air feels heavy and a touch metallic, the sort of night where sound travels and edges blur, giving everything a muted, cinematic clarity.\n\nShowers look set to arrive properly by late evening, pulsing to a steadier, moderate spell before easing to lighter rain after midnight. Expect a grey, wet night rather than anything dramatic. Dress for damp: a light waterproof, closed shoes you don\u2019t mind getting speckled, and a layer to fend off the chill. It\u2019s a good time for modest errands under shop awnings, a quiet airport pickup with the wipers keeping time, or staying in to sort tomorrow\u2019s bag, iron a shirt, or write out the week\u2019s list while the rain puts a soft patter to the windows. If you need air, a brief walk under cover will do; otherwise let the night do its work and keep things simple.",
