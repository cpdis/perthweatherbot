    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is calm and mostly clear, with the gentle whisper of a south wind creating an almost serene ambiance. As the temperature dips to a comfortable chill around 49 degrees, it invites one to reach for a cozy sweater or a light jacket, perhaps while enjoying an evening stroll along the waterfront, where the shimmering city lights dance on the bay.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the morning promises abundant sunshine, heralding a pleasant day with clear blue skies and a high nudging 62 degrees. The north-northeast wind, gentle but refreshing, will carry you away from the bustling streets toward the tranquil parks or charming caf\u00e9s dotting the landscape. With temperatures subtly retreating to around 59 in the afternoon, it's an ideal time to venture outdoors\u2014be it a leisurely walk through the vibrant streets or a moment spent at a sun-drenched view point, soaking in the city\u2019s splendor. Dress in layers, embracing both the warmth of the sun and the coolness of the evening that follows, and you\u2019ll be perfectly attuned to the day's rhythm, savoring the pleasure found in the simplicity of a sunny San Francisco winter day.",
