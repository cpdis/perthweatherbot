    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Subiaco, the day's veil of scattered clouds is edging towards a late evening of broken cloud cover. The sun, though its strength has waned with the day, still threads its rays through the cloud gaps, painting a burnished glow against the dimming canvas of the sky. The touch of day's warmth lingers, a silent promise against the imminent embrace of the evening chill.\n\nInvoking the oil-painted image of a classical landscape, this day in Subiaco calls for lightweight outerwear to combat the cooling temperatures and the occasional game of hide-and-seek with the sun. The possibilities of the evening lie in a stroll by your favorite park, wrapped in layers of light fabric, your stroll made magical by the play of fading sunlight through the teardrop foliage. Or perhaps, nestle in the embrace of your favored nook with a book, the soft whispering of the winds a soothing lullaby punctuating the peace.",
