    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a muted energy fills the air, tinged with the anticipation of rain. A slight chill lingers, with the temperature settling around 44 degrees, gently coaxed upward to 46 as the hours drift by. The northeast winds carry whispers of a softer storm, rustling through the quiet streets, their brisk touch reminding us that even the mildest of evenings can still whisper secrets of possibility. The sky is veiled in clouds, parting now and again to hint at moonlit beauty, yet there's a subtle gloom, a shadow of fog looming near the bay, creating an enigmatic edge to the view of the Golden Gate.\n\nSunday promises a delicate unfolding, with the sun attempting to break through the partly cloudy canvas. While a slight chance of rain showers lingers before the afternoon, the breeze will carry a coolness, inviting one to bundle in layers\u2014a cozy sweater or light jacket paired with comfortable shoes for an afternoon stroll. The city might beckon you to wander its quieter corners: perhaps a visit to a tucked-away caf\u00e9, where warmth and conversation chase away the moodiness, or an exploration of nearby parks, where the air is crisp and filled with the mingled aromas of wet earth and coffee. Though the day may waver between sunshine and shadow, it holds the promise of serene moments among the gentle hills and storied streets.",
