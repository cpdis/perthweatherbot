    "weather_report": "West Perth wakes under a rinsed-blue sky, the sun already keen and insistent by late morning. The air is dry and bright, the sort of clarity that sharpens edges and sends shadows skittering under awnings. Expect the blue to hold through the heart of the day, with the sun turning fierce; UV will rocket to very high, likely extreme at midday, so shade becomes an ally and concrete throws back a hard glare.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for light, breathable fabrics and an easy brimmed hat, sunglasses that don\u2019t slip, a quiet film of sunscreen and a bottle of water that never quite leaves your hand. Run small errands or take a calm coffee outdoors before the sun peaks, then slip indoors for a spell\u2014library stacks, a gallery room, a cool desk where work hums more softly. As the afternoon begins to ease, a gentle loop through a nearby park or a meander to the shops will feel kind again, the light turning honeyed and forgiving.",
