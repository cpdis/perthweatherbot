    "weather_report": "On this February morning, Subiaco rests under a blanket of clear, sapphire skies, giving the town a distinct, tranquil beauty. The town wakes with a light sigh as the gentle warmth of the anticipated radiant sun glimmers on the horizon. Shadows play tag along the corners of the cobblestones, while sunbeams slip into every crevice, lighting up the burgeoning day. \n\nTravelers need not trouble themselves with heavy coats and scarves today. A light jumper with a favorite pair of sunglasses perched playfully upon the crest of the nose would suffice. The day seems like a generous offering from nature for an undisrupted stride along the park, enjoying a good book under the comforting hug of an old, magnanimous tree, or a quiet coffeeshop stop as the world awakes. Dare we also suggest getting an early start to the weekend chores, leveraging the sun's gentle cheer. In all, it promises to be a day kissed by the crystal clarity of a perfect sky and brushed by the mild touch of an early spring dawn.",
