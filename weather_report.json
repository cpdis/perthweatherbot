    "weather_report": "Evening in Subiaco arrives under a quilt of broken cloud, the last hues slipping off the rooftops. Earlier, the sun came and went through scattered patches, gentle rather than glaring; now the UV has fallen to a whisper and will fade to nothing after dusk. The sky isn\u2019t crystal, more a soft matte with drifting texture, which lends the streets a calm, cinematic quiet. Air cools steadily and feels kind, the warmth of the day easing from the stones.\n\nDress in light layers\u2014shirt and a thin sweater or jacket if you intend to linger outdoors\u2014and comfortable shoes for unhurried steps. It\u2019s a good time for ordinary pleasures: a short stroll to pick up bread, watering the balcony plants, a leisurely loop on the bike before night settles, or a simple dinner near a window to watch the clouds shuffle past. Expect the cloud cover to hold as the evening deepens, with no sharp sun and the UV muted to near zero, a night made for low voices and small rituals.",
