    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a canopy of thick cloud cover, painting the skyline in muted shades of gray. Rain whispers on the horizon, a persistent reminder of the more somber weather looming closer. As temperatures settle near the range of the mid-sixties, a chill permeates the air, encouraged by brisk winds from the south-southwest that rustle through the streets, occasionally whipping up to 29 mph. The chance of rain hangs heavily, with an 80% likelihood that the soft patter will soon become a steady rhythm against rooftops and sidewalks.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the evening promises to maintain this trend of cloudiness and the remnants of rain, a gentle echo of the day. The predicted low temperature offers little comfort, settling around 52 degrees, reinforcing the need for layers if venturing outdoors. A light sweater or a windbreaker would serve well against the cool breeze, ideal for an evening stroll beneath the somber clouds or perhaps a warm cup of coffee in the comfort of your favorite caf\u00e9. While the allure of discovering hidden gems might still beckon from the heart of the city, the weather suggests embracing warmth and coziness, whether indoors or in the fleeting moments of misty rain that dance upon the metal and glass of the bustling streets.",
