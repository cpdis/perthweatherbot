    "weather_report": "As the early summer evening settles over Subiaco, the sky paints itself with a tapestry of muted hues, suggesting a day that has gracefully slipped from the hold of the sun. Scattered clouds earlier in the afternoon have grown into a more intricate dance of broken clouds, creating a canvas of gentle shadows and subtle light. It's a serene summer evening, with the air cool enough to drape a light cardigan over your shoulders. The diminishing sun paints a muted glow, deceptive in its warmth, as the UV index seems to whisper rather than shout, allowing skin to breathe easy without the harsh sting of sunburn. The clouds balance the day\u2019s warmth with their gentle breezes, urging residents to stroll leisurely, indulging in a languid walk through the lanes or perhaps sitting outside a quaint caf\u00e9, sipping on a chilled drink. It\u2019s the perfect time for casual outdoor conversations or dipping into the pages of a much-cherished novel. In these hours, Subiaco offers a day turning into night without haste, inviting you to savor the subtlety of an evening slightly dressed, much like an unpretentious but well-tuned jazz composition, gentle yet thoroughly engaging.",
