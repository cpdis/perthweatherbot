    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a clean, glassy sky and the kind of stillness that sharpens edges and softens voices. The forecast shows a day that ran bright and untroubled by cloud, so the sun would have been generous and the UV lively through the afternoon; now, after sunset, it fades to almost nothing. Visibility is crisp, the air uncomplicated, and the night promises to remain clear and agreeable.\n\nDress for a gentle cool-down: light layers, a cardigan or soft jacket, comfortable shoes for an unhurried loop around the block. It\u2019s a good hour to step out for a small errand, walk the dog a little longer than usual, or take a slow bench sit with a book. Windows can be cracked to freshen the room without inviting chill, and if you look up, the sky will repay you with quiet clarity.",
