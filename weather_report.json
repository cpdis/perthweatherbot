    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a bright, golden sun that dances on the skyline, warming the air to a pleasant high of 66 degrees. The brisk north wind stirs, adding a touch of lively energy, and as the day progresses, temperatures will gently ebb towards a cooler 59, nudged by the soft embrace of fading daylight. Tonight, the clouds will thin, allowing a delicate curtain of stars to peek through, ushering in a low around 50 degrees where whispers of marine air linger, riding on the north-northeast winds. \n\nThe horizon shows little sign of fog; the famed marine layer appears subdued, allowing the city\u2019s contours to be clearly defined, though the pockets of cooler air will soon weave their way back into the evening tapestry. This tranquil weather invites thoughtful dress\u2014perhaps layers that celebrate both warmth and the coolness of the night ahead, a light jacket for comfort as one strolls along the waterfront or sinks into an outdoor caf\u00e9. As dusk approaches, the vibrancy of the city beckons conversation and companionship, making it a lovely time to indulge in leisurely walks along the bay or to explore the local art galleries that come alive under the evening glow.",
