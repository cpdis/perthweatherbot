    "weather_report": "Perth leans into late afternoon with a mostly open sky and just a smatter of cloud, the light turning buttery and kind to the eyes. It\u2019s a clear, dry sort of day, the kind where edges look crisp and the sun still has a little bite even as it slides west; UV is easing now, but if you\u2019re out before dinner, a hat and a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray. Expect the evening to drift toward scattered cloud without much fuss, the warmth softening and a gentle breeze tidying the heat away. It feels pleasantly unhurried: light clothes for now, with a thin layer handy once shadows lengthen. Good weather for a quiet walk to the shops, watering the herbs, a quick ride along familiar streets, or sitting by an open window, letting the day cool as you finish the last email and watch the gold fade to blue.",
