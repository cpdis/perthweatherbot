    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the clouds gather with intent, hinting at the rain that is likely to grace the city before 10 PM. The air feels fresh, with a temperature settling around 48 degrees, punctuated by a brisk northwest wind that briskly stirs the leaves and carries the scent of impending rain. Although the chance of precipitation hovers at 60%, the city\u2019s skyline, though partially kissed by the clouds, remains largely coherent, allowing for a view of its iconic features while the wind sings its soft, nature-inspired symphony.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a sunny disposition awaits, though don\u2019t be deceived by the charm; the high will hover near 58 but will slip to 54 as the afternoon drifts in, accompanied by winds that will dance playfully at 10 to 17 mph. It promises to be a day of clarity, ideal for an afternoon stroll or a quiet moment in one of the city's many parks. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will suffice against the wind's cool embrace, making it a splendid opportunity for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where fresh sea air mingles with vibrant city life. In this temperate oasis, every corner has a sense of possibility, waiting for someone to explore it anew.",
