    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco arrives with a pewter light and clouds knitting themselves into a steady ceiling. Skies are thickening now, and a band of light rain is due to slip in around evening and linger into the night\u2014more a soft patter than a storm. Sunshine will be scarce; what little breaks through will be muted, and the UV stays low, the day\u2019s clarity gently blurred like glass breathed upon. It feels calm rather than bleak, a small, silvery pause.\n\nDress for a damp stroll and an easy transition indoors: a light waterproof or umbrella, breathable layers, and shoes with a bit of grip. Good hours for ordinary comforts\u2014duck into a corner bookshop or the library before it closes, pick up bread for supper, tend to a quiet errand under the awnings, or brew tea and catch up on the week\u2019s stray notes. If you fancy fresh air, take a brief walk between showers and listen to the softened city, then head home before the pavement gleams.",
