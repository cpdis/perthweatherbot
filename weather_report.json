    "weather_report": "As the late afternoon settles into its gentle embrace in Subiaco, the sky above remains modestly adorned with scattered clouds, soft wisps quietly drifting against the fading hues of day. The sun, though not entirely veiled, has played the part of a shy actor today, filtering its warmth in doses through gaps in its cloudy audience. A tapestry of soft gray and steel-blue dominates above, creating a subdued yet mysteriously beautiful light. As you roam the suburban streets or perhaps linger in your garden, know that the air brings a calm, gentle presence. It wraps around you like a favorite worn-in jacket, offering comfort without the excessive cling of humidity or heat.\n\nAdjust your attire to suit these tender moments; a lightweight cardigan or pullover will suffice, safeguarding against any sudden coolness the evening may bring. The UV index, reduced under this meandering cloud cover, permits more freedom, so embrace the twilight without the constant need for shades. With the sweetness of the day beginning its gradual descent into the depths of night, consider engaging in quiet reflection or a peaceful walk, letting the subtly shifting skies be your companion. As the day edges closer to its celestial counterpart, now is not the time for extravagant adventures but rather a hopeful pause, a simple meditation on the transient beauty of the day's gentle close.",
