    "weather_report": "The evening in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a tapestry of shifting skies, as the day teeters on the edge of a light rain that may grace the city before 4 AM. The air is crisp, whispering a chill that hovers around the low 48s, bolstered by a breezy northwest wind that carries a playful edge, gusting up to 22 mph. As shadows stretch across the streets, the early hints of rain tease with a 30% chance of brief, almost unnoticeable drizzle, barely sufficient to soak the pavement yet enough to add a sheen to the city's iconic landmarks.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will assert its presence, promising a cheerful retreat from tonight's fleeting clouds. While the day's high rests at a comfortable 59, a gentle afternoon cooling to the mid-50s reminds us of the city\u2019s capricious climate. As clarity prevails, the potential for a marine layer dissipates, leaving behind a delightful canvas for shimmering views of the Golden Gate and the undulating hills. For those planning their evening, a light jacket may serve you well as you meander through the streets, perhaps pausing at a corner caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or taking a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero while the lights of the Bay Bridge flicker to life. Such nights welcome solitude or companionship, inviting you to savor the subtle beauty present even in the fleeting moments before dawn breaks again.",
