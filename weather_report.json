    "weather_report": "Cottesloe is waking beneath a perfectly clear sky, the last stars thinning to a pale wash before sunrise. The morning will open bright and untroubled, with that crisp, salt-clean clarity that makes colors pop and edges look freshly drawn. Expect a gentle coolness at first, softening as the sun lifts; by late morning the light will turn assertive and the UV will climb quickly, typical of early spring here, so the day promises both beauty and bite. Visibility should be excellent, the horizon sharp and unblurred.\n\nDress in easy layers: a light top or long sleeves for the first hour, then short sleeves, sunglasses, and a hat once the sun takes command; sunscreen after breakfast is wise. This is a day for ordinary pleasures\u2014an unhurried walk to fetch coffee while the shadows are long, a quick cycle for errands before the glare, hanging the washing to take advantage of the dry air, or reading on a veranda where you can move your chair with the sun. As the light hardens toward midday, slip into shade or an indoor task with the windows open, and save the meander home for the softened glow of late afternoon.",
