    "weather_report": "As the dawn unfolds its mantle over the district of Subiaco, it rummages through a spectral palette devoid of yellows and golds. A languid overcast sky reigns supreme, betraying the absence of the jubilant sun. Not an echo of last evening's light rain persists, and the day subsists as a remnant of a dream penetrated by dimmed silhouettes of clouds. The sun, in its bashful retreat, has placed its confidence in these overcast sentinels, forestalling the arrival of bright blues synonymous with hope.\n\nAs the residents of Subiaco rise from their slumbers, they are greeted by the scented memory of rainfall and a day shrouded in the quietude of an overcast sky. Under such conditions, an ensemble reflecting the weather's mood serves a fitting tribute - a comfortably cozy cardigan perhaps, paired with an umbrella bracing itself for the possibility of an unexpected encore. Neither the promise of a beach day nor an invitation to the park, Subiaco's weather today inspires an introspective retreat within the warmth of one's hearth, diving into a good book or perhaps, nurturing an abandoned hobby, while the outside world languishes in its monochrome state.",
