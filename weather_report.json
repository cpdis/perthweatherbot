    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco brings a mix of bright moments before the clouds move in. For now, the sun casts a gentle glow on the city, complemented by a light west-northwest breeze, making it a delicate balance between warmth and coolness. As the day progresses, however, the forecast subtly shifts, indicating a 30% chance of rain creeping in after four o'clock. The air may eventually chill, dipping to a brisk feeling around the mid-50s.\n\nAs dusk settles, a blanket of rain is expected, transforming the atmosphere into a cozy retreat. Tonight promises a steady downpour, with gray clouds wrapping the city in a shroud of mystery. The southern winds may whip up to 14 mph, adding a briskness to the evening as temperatures hover around a mild 50 degrees. With a full 100% chance of precipitation, it\u2019s wise to gear up in comfortable layers\u2014think a light jacket to fend off the chill, perhaps a hat to shield from the forthcoming rain, and sturdy shoes that can manage puddles along the sidewalks. Given the conditions, a thoughtful choice of activity might be to find a nearby caf\u00e9 where you can curl up with a warm drink, or perhaps take a leisurely stroll under an umbrella, enjoying the rhythmic patter of rain against the pavement as the day transitions into night.",
