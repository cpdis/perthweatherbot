    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, a quilt of broken cloud hangs over quiet streets, softening the last stars and promising a morning of mottled light. Expect the day to open gently with patches of blue and filtered sunshine, more bright than gloomy, the kind that makes colors look rinsed and clean. UV is low right now but will climb quickly after breakfast, likely reaching the kind of strength that nips at unguarded skin even through shifting gaps in the cloud. The air should feel agreeable rather than harsh; clarity decent, the horizon a little veiled by the broken deck. Dress in light layers you can peel back, with a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen for later. It\u2019s a morning suited to unhurried errands, a walk to the bakery, or watering the garden while the light is still soft; by midmorning, a short pedal to the shops or a tidy at the desk near a window as the sun comes and goes.",
