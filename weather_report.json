    "weather_report": "As the dark stirrings of early morning envelop Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a hint of crispness, perhaps foretelling the slight chance of rain that could scatter its whispers until 4 AM. The streets, partly cloudy and kissed by a fresh northeast wind, suggest a cool embrace, with temperatures snugly resting around 44. The silent promise of a new day unfolds as the city prepares for the sun to ascend, painting the skies with the soft hues that will unfurl across the horizon.\n\nBy midday, the sun will take center stage, its warmth pushing temperatures to a high of nearly 57, before retreating slightly in the afternoon. Winds will dance gently around 8 to 18 mph, coaxing playful leaves into the air while keeping a subtle chill in the atmosphere. The anticipated clarity, unfurling with the dawning sun, is likely to envelop the cityscape, driven away from the golden gate by the promise of brighter skies. In this serene environment, a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely read in a sun-drenched park could be just the remedy, inviting you to savor the peaceful hum of life returning to its rhythm. Dressing in layers is wise\u2014a soft sweater or light jacket paired with comfortable shoes will ensure you\u2019re ready for both the cool nip of the morning and the warmth of the late day.",
