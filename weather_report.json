    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle coolness lingers in the air, hinting at the day\u2019s gradual transition from the crisp early morning. For now, the skies remain largely clear, though wisps of fog can be seen embracing the Golden Gate Bridge, promising a dramatic play of light as the sun rises higher. As you step outside, a subtle warmth begins to mingle with the chill, suggesting a day that will flirt with sunshine and the possibility of light rain later on.\n\nThe forecast hints at a slight chance of drizzle this afternoon, cloaked in a shroud of clouds, and it might be wise to dress in layers. A light jacket or sweater will serve you well as temperatures hover between the brisk and the mild, allowing for comfortable strolls through the city\u2019s vibrant streets. As the sun arcs overhead and the chance of rain increases closer to evening, consider local cafes or quiet parks where you might savor a warm drink, watching the city\u2019s pulse change as day merges into night. Engage in leisurely activities\u2014perhaps peruse an independent bookstore or marvel at the elegantly aging architecture that lends character and history to these storied streets.",
