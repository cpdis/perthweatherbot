    "weather_report": "As dusk descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a mild embrace, perfect for a lingering stroll or a quiet moment spent savoring the landscape. Tonight, the skies don a partly cloudy robe, with temperatures gracefully settling around 50 degrees. The gentle southwest breeze, whispering at around 3 mph, adds a subtle, refreshing chill to the evening air, encouraging a light jacket or sweater to ward off the evening coolness.\n\nThe approaching day promises a transformation, as Saturday beckons with an invitation of mostly sunny skies and a high flirting with 63 degrees. Though the day may see temperatures wane slightly to the low 60s in the afternoon, clear vents will allow warmth to cradle the city before the coolness of evening returns. While the fog may tease its presence in the distance, it is hardly a deterrent; instead, it acts as a gentle reminder of the marine layer that frequently caresses the Bay. As darkness readies to blanket the city, outdoor paintings of twilight may sway through your thoughts. Perhaps a quiet evening spent at a nearby caf\u00e9, or a stroll along the Embarcadero, will offer the perfect backdrop to unwind after a day well-lived.",
