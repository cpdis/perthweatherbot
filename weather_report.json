    "weather_report": "Past midnight in Cottesloe, the town is held beneath a lacquered, star-sharp sky. The air feels dry and kindly, the sort that carries sound a little farther and lets you breathe a little deeper; it looks to stay clear through the small hours, with the horizon neat as a ruler.\n\nDawn should rise into a clean, blue morning and a day that\u2019s frank and sun-forward. Sunshine will be strong and the UV quick to bite by late morning, typical of the season, so plan for shade, sunscreen, and a brimmed hat once the day gets going. For now, a light layer suits a quiet stroll or a gentle bike to settle the mind; after sunrise, shift to airy fabrics. It\u2019s a good morning for simple errands done early, watering the garden before the heat gathers, hanging a wash to take advantage of the crisp air, or claiming a window seat with coffee while the light brightens. If the afternoon turns sharp, let the day pass from a cool room and step back out as evening smooths the edges again.",
