    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into late afternoon under a spotless, luminous sky; the sun has shifted from fierce to benevolent, throwing long, honey-colored angles across roofs and gum leaves. It has been a clear, uncomplicated day from morning onward, with sharp visibility and no hint of haze, and the calm continues into the evening. UV was punchy around midday but ebbs now to forgiving levels; sunglasses still help with the glare, while a brimmed hat becomes optional, and a light layer will be welcome once the warmth slips away after sunset. The mood is quietly pleasant, the kind of dry, clean light that makes ordinary tasks feel easy.\n\nIf you\u2019re out, dress simply\u2014cool fabrics for now, a cardigan in your bag for later. This is good weather for small errands on foot, watering the balcony pots, airing the house, or a gentle roll to the shops by bike before dinner. If you\u2019d rather linger, find a bench with a bit of shade and finish that chapter as the day unspools toward evening.",
