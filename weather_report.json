    "weather_report": "As the night advances, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a gentle embrace of patchy fog and moist air, casting a soft veil over the iconic skyline. The muted lights flicker like distant stars, while a mostly cloudy expanse opens to a tranquil night, underlining the city\u2019s signature chill, with temperatures resting near forty-nine degrees. For those braving the evening, a light sweater or jacket might just suffice against the cool, west-northwest breeze that barely stirs, offering a whisper rather than a gust.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the promise of Monday unfolds with lingering fog that may lazily dissipate before noon. Emerging sunshine hints at a day that will start somber yet evolve into a wash of light and warmth, likely reaching a high near fifty-eight. The afternoon may see temperatures gently fall back to the mid-fifties, a cue that layers will serve well throughout the day. Morning walkers might find delight in the stillness, a sip of coffee warming their hands, while those venturing outdoors in the afternoon may relish the soft sun illuminating the vibrant streets. Engaging in the simple pleasure of a stroll through the park or an artful pause at a local caf\u00e9 may be the perfect way to indulge in the beauty of the day ahead, as a hint of clarity beckons from the clouds.",
