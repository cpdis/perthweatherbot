    "weather_report": "Awakening to a soft haze, Downtown San Francisco carries an air of quiet anticipation this morning. The clouds hang low, intertwined with the scent of potential rain, casting a gentle gray over the familiar skyline. With a brisk wind nudging along at about nine miles per hour, the chill nips through the layers, urging a touch of warmth in your attire\u2014a light jacket or a cozy sweater will serve you well against the cool air, especially as the temperature drops slightly throughout the day.\n\nAs the hours pass, a whisper of rain continues to linger, teasing the possibility of a sprinkle here and there. The forecast suggests a 40% chance of precipitation, but no deluge is expected\u2014perhaps a light mist will grace the streets, paving the way for a quiet reflection amid the urban bustle. There\u2019s a somber beauty today; the clouds, heavy yet poetic, cradle the city in a soft embrace, perfect for an afternoon spent browsing tucked-away bookstores or wandering through dimly lit caf\u00e9s with a warm drink in hand. Plan for an evening stroll, where the city lights gently pierce the marine layer, offering glimpses of a hidden charm beneath the mist.",
