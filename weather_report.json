    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a gentle drizzle, lending a quiet murkiness to the landscape. The clouds conspire low and heavy, the air thickening with the promise of a more persistent rain later tonight. As the temperatures slide from the mild touches of 59 to the cool embrace of 56, the environment feels damp, a chill settling in with the southerly winds that whisper through the streets. It\u2019s a day that invites you to draw your scarf a little tighter, perhaps donning a water-resistant jacket to shield against both the persistent drizzle and the brisk winds that could surprise with gusts up to 23 mph.\n\nAs evening approaches, expectations of rain linger like a forgotten melody, with potential drizzles arching into a more assured downpour before the night fully descends. The visibility appears muted, almost ethereal, enchanting yet opaque, and the fog that dances over the Golden Gate suggests an intrusive marine layer hanging just above. It\u2019s not a day for picnics in the park or long strolls along the waterfront, but rather an opportunity to savor the solitude of a cozy corner caf\u00e9, perhaps accompanied by a warm cup of something comforting. Look towards the original charm of the Mission District or seek refuge in the warmth of the city\u2019s museums\u2014this weather is certainly an invitation to enjoy the city\u2019s heart from its indoors, where the embrace of warmth can be found away from the rain.",
