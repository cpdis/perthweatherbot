    "weather_report": "The city of Perth finds itself under a soft veil of light rain as the afternoon settles in, with the morning's gentle shower lingering into the day. Clouds gather above, grey and resolute, successfully muting the sun's ardor and presenting a murky tableau that renders reflective pools upon the pavement. As this wistful weather cloaks the city, the air carries a cool edge that lacks the bite of winter's chill yet whispers quietly of its presence. There will be little opportunity to bask today, as the UV index remains low beneath this cottony ceiling. \n\nSuch a day invites relaxed pursuits and comfortable attires: snug layers to ward off dampness and practical shoes to navigate the puddle-marked streets. Perhaps today is less for the outdoor exploits and more suited to the cocoon of indoor indulgences, where one can savor a warm brew, languidly paging through a cherished book or engrossing oneself in a slow, comforting task. Evening will descend with a gentle sigh, and it becomes an opportunity to gather with loved ones, crafting warmth with laughter and stories as rain gently taps at the window, an ambient reminder of the marathon stillness of a rainy day.",
