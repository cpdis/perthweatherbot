    "weather_report": "The day in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a cloak of shifting light, with pockets of sun playfully dancing between resilient clouds. An aura of coolness settles in, as temperatures hover comfortably around 62, gradually slipping toward the cooler embrace of 60 later this afternoon. The gentle southwest wind whispers through the city, offering a refreshing touch, yet as evening approaches, the sound of raindrops will begin to dot the pavement, signaling a transition to a more subdued ambiance.\n\nAs night descends, expect the sky to carry a heavier mantle of clouds, with rain arriving before the sun bids farewell. The forecast hints at a brisk breeze, with gusts that may rattle tree branches and rustle leaves. Should you venture out, the rising temperatures will likely support a light sweater or jacket, an essential companion against the chill that accompanies the impending drizzle. This is not a day for grand outdoor adventures; rather, consider a quiet stroll through the neighborhood as the city glimmers with reflections off wet streets, or indulge in the comforting embrace of a favorite caf\u00e9. A book and a warm drink could make for a serene evening, perfectly in tune with the rhythmic pulse of the rain.",
