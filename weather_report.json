    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco feels freshly rinsed, last night\u2019s light rain having slipped away to leave damp streets and a rinsed, clean hush. A few clouds linger and thin, the air cool and clear, with visibility sharp enough to catch the first pale hints of morning along the roofs. Expect the day to open up quickly: by midmorning the sun will take center stage, skies mostly clear, and the UV will rise fast, turning harsh around midday despite the gentle start.\n\nIt looks like an easy, pleasant day once the ground dries. Dress in light layers you can shed, with a hat and sunglasses; sunscreen will earn its keep after breakfast. A light jacket for the early hour, then breathable clothing for the warm glide of the afternoon. Good weather for a slow walk to the bakery, a tidy-up of the garden without the hose, a couple of errands done on foot, or a quiet ride once the pavement loses its sheen. Later, find a patch of shade and let the bright hours idle past.",
