    "weather_report": "Katy eases into late afternoon under a calm, pewter sky. Morning\u2019s blanket of cloud loosened at midday into torn patches, and now the sun surfaces only in brief, milky flashes before dimming again. The air is steady and breathable, but the view stays soft-edged rather than crystal. Sunshine will be limited; the UV ran gentle, perhaps briefly modest at lunch, and now sits comfortably low as evening draws near.\n\nExpect the cloud cover to linger with the occasional bright opening, a muted backdrop that invites an unhurried pace. Dress in light layers\u2014a soft sweater or easy jacket\u2014something you can shrug off if a sunbreak finds you. Sunglasses are optional, more for a passing glare than a sustained shine. It\u2019s a good time for small errands, a quiet loop around the block, or a few minutes of porch sitting while the day idles toward dusk; then indoors by a window, where the gray light slows the mind to a manageable clip.",
