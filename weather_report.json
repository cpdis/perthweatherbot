    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the rain drizzles steadily, casting a muted sheen over the pavement. The air is thick with the unmistakable scent of wet earth, and the soft patter of droplets creates an intimate serenade as they dance against rooftops and sidewalks alike. The clouds brood overhead, cloaking the sky in gray hues that promise an unyielding chill throughout the night. Wind gusts rush through, playfully sweeping across corners and alleyways, reminding one of the city's ceaseless rhythm. \n\nTomorrow brings with it similar layers of moisture, as the rain persists in its tender embrace, reducing visibility and saturating the landscape. The temperature lingers in the cool 50s, urging residents to don thicker, weather-resistant attire. A stylish raincoat, perhaps a sturdy umbrella, and practical footwear would serve well in navigating the slick streets. As you consider how to spend this drizzly day, perhaps a cozy seat at a local caf\u00e9, warm drink in hand, would be the perfect antidote\u2014offering solace as you watch the world glide by, wrapped in the intimate scenario that only a stormy day can create.",
