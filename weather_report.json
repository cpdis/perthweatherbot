    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a clear, polished sky and the day\u2019s glare softening to honeyed light. The air feels dry and uncomplicated, visibility crisp, shadows long and gentle. Sunshine remains generous for a short while yet, but the sting has left it; the UV is ebbing to low as the sun slides away, making this the comfortable edge of the day when colors turn thoughtful and the streets quieten.\n\nThe forecast holds steady and simple: a clear, starry night ahead. It looks pleasantly calm rather than dazzling, made for light clothes now and perhaps a soft layer after dark if you linger outside. It\u2019s a good hour for small rituals: water the pots, stroll to pick up something for dinner, or sit on the balcony and let the sky do its slow work. If you\u2019re out before the last light, a hat is optional and sunscreen likely unnecessary, but a bottle of water and unhurried steps fit the mood.",
