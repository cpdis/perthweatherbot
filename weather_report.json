    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco blankets itself in a gentle, partially cloaked embrace, with the moon casting a silver glow over the city\u2019s familiar contours. The wind whispers softly from the west, just brushing the skin at a cool 3 mph, hinting at the crisp night air that settles in, the temperature dipping to a chill that will hover around 46 degrees. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will be wise companions for a stroll along the quieter streets.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, expect the sun to play peekaboo behind the clouds, the temperature slowly rising to a high near 55, eventually averaging out in the afternoon around 52. The atmosphere will remain partially sunny, though a veil of fog may linger around the iconic bridges and Golden Gate, painting the landscape in hues of mystery. The west-southwest winds may coax a gentle, refreshing movement to the air, particularly inviting those inclined to enjoy a casual outdoor excursion. Mornings could be best suited for sipping coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while wrapped in the comfort of a light scarf, as the day unfolds into one that beckons thoughtful wandering through Downtown's urban tapestry.\n\nWith the quiet hum of the city rejuvenating itself in these gentle conditions, one might consider an afternoon visit to the waterfront or indulge in exploration at a nearby gallery\u2014ideal pursuits for a day that promises to be reflective and layered, much like the clouds above.",
