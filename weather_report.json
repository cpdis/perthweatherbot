    "weather_report": "Late afternoon settles over Perth with the sky turned to brushed pewter and the air carrying that first, certain hint of rain. Light showers are poised to arrive around sundown and drift back again in the evening, keeping sunshine to fleeting, filtered glimmers at best. The UV index is low now and falling toward negligible with the day\u2019s slow fade, and the view has that softened clarity that makes edges blur and colors deepen.\n\nIt looks like a gentle, damp evening rather than a harsh one, so a light waterproof jacket and shoes that won\u2019t sulk at puddles should do, with an umbrella as quiet company. If you\u2019ve a few errands, take care of them before the steadier drops begin; afterward, a short stroll between showers can be surprisingly calm, the streets rinsed and reflective. It\u2019s a good night for a simple supper, a book by the window, or sorting the week\u2019s bits and pieces while the rain taps out its small, patient rhythm.",
