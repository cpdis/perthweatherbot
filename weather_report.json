    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Adelaide, the sky feels heavy, the kind of woolen gray that hushes the streets and slicks the bitumen with a faint sheen. Moderate rain is due to settle in toward dawn and spill into the early morning, so the night will stay dim and close, with little chance of starlight or moonlight breaking through. Sunrise will likely be a muted unveiling, clouds thick enough to keep the day subdued; clarity will be soft around the edges, horizons smudged, and the sun only a rumor behind slate. UV will start very low and may remain modest if the canopy holds.\n\nExpect a cool, damp morning that asks for light layers under a rain shell and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles; pack an umbrella, and if you\u2019re cycling, lights and patience. It\u2019s a good day for unhurried errands under verandas, a quiet tram ride with a small book, or an early wander through the market when doors roll up and steam curls from coffee cups. If showers slacken later, take a brisk loop along the river where the air smells freshly washed, then retreat to something domestic and useful: sorting a drawer, tending houseplants, writing a short note you\u2019ve been meaning to send. The day won\u2019t be sunny, but it will be gentle, and that can be its own kind of light.",
