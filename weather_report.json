    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a tranquil clarity bordered by a gentle chill. The overnight skies have mostly remained clear, allowing for the sparkle of stars to linger just a while longer before the sun rises to take its rightful place. Currently, the atmosphere is fresh, with a low around 49, inviting residents to embrace the briskness of early morning. The serenity is punctuated only by whispers of a north-northeast wind, soft yet persistent, hinting at the calm of a beautiful day ahead.\n\nAs the sun climbs higher, painting the skyline in hues of golden warmth, expect delightful sunshine to prevail, coaxing temperatures toward a mild high of 63 before they gently recede in the afternoon. The absence of fog today is a gift; while San Francisco often dresses in fog, this morning reveals crystal-clear views not obscured by the marine layer. With these pleasant conditions, a light sweater or jacket will suffice, particularly as you stroll through the city's iconic streets or perhaps wander through one of its many parks. With such inviting weather, it\u2019s the perfect moment to savor a quiet caf\u00e9 breakfast, embark on an explorative walk along the waterfront, or relish the vibrant energy of the city\u2019s neighborhoods. Today, San Francisco welcomes you to appreciate its beauty\u2014intimate, clear, and undeniably captivating.",
