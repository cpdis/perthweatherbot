    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and invites an almost serene quiet. With a low settling around the mid-forties, the cool night breeze gently stirs, hinting at a comfortable yet invigorating charm. Tonight\u2019s skies are unblemished, displaying a clarity that allows the stars to twinkle generously, veiling the city under a soft blanket of tranquility. There is no sign of fog obscuring the horizon, allowing unobstructed views of the landmarks that define this coast.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun will rise to bless the day with its warmth, reaching into the low sixties by afternoon. The clear blue sky invites exploration, a chance to take in the city\u2019s vibrant energy perhaps on foot, strolling through the quaint streets, or enjoying a coffee at a local caf\u00e9 terrace. As the afternoon progresses, a slight chill may eventually weave through the air, so layering a light jacket over a simple shirt would be wise, ensuring comfort as temperatures subtly dip. It is a day beckoning to be spent outdoors, breathing in the fresh sea breeze, discovering the hidden treasures that grace this beloved city, with every moment marinated in the peaceful allure of a San Francisco winter.",
