    "weather_report": "As evening descends over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle curtain of rain showers begins to envelop the city, cloaking it in a snug haze. The sky, cloaked in a thick layer of clouds, hangs low, almost kissing the rooftops with a subdued gray pallor. A brisk south wind carries the promise of moisture, rustling the leaves and nudging umbrellas towards unwary pedestrians. The air, crisp yet softened by the dampness, sits around 55 degrees, ensuring a chill that settles into bones. With an 80% chance of rain, it\u2019s prudent to prepare for a rather drizzly night ahead; the whispers of water on pavement will serenade those who brave the outdoors.\n\nLooking towards Sunday, expect the rain to continue, intensifying before giving way to a transformed day. The sky will remain resolutely overcast, and the high will hover around the muddled mid-50s, a reminder that winter clings to this vibrant town. A planned outing warrants layers\u2014perhaps a light raincoat over a cozy sweater, accompanied by sturdy shoes to navigate puddles and slick streets. The moisture-laden air may not cradle the sun\u2019s warmth, but it also holds the chance for fleeting moments of quiet beauty: reflections in puddles, the rich scent of earth, and the comforting rhythm of raindrops. As you settle into the weekend, consider seeking solace in a quaint caf\u00e9 or embracing the opportunity to curl up with a good book, letting the symphony of rain become your beloved backdrop.",
