    "weather_report": "As the clock rolls into the quiet hours of the night, Downtown San Francisco is embraced by an impending curtain of rain, ushered in by mostly cloudy skies that obscure the stars above. The temperature lingers in a mild embrace, hinting at 56 degrees, while a soft southeast wind whispers gently through the streets. The chance of precipitation, resting at a modest 60%, suggests a greater intimacy with the elements tonight\u2014perhaps a light drizzle that might sweep through, though any substantial accumulation seems hesitant.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the city presents an evolving narrative. A slight chance of rain flirts with the afternoon, but for now, a delicate balance of clouds prevails. Highs near 62 could give way to cooler air, inviting the sort of layers that are joyful under the weight of a heavy coat\u2014a scarf might serve you well as you navigate the city. As the fog gently drapes itself along the bay, hinting at the marine layer that clings to the shores, the iconic silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the rooftops of the city may only partially reveal themselves. These conditions invite cozy adventures: strolls through the quiet corners of a favorite bookstore, savoring warm coffee paired with the soft glow of a new read, or perhaps an intimate dinner at a corner caf\u00e9, where the ambiance is enriched by the pitter-patter of rain outside. It\u2019s a day for embracing the small pleasures that comfort and inspire, finding joy in the murmur of the city as it reflects the tender gloom of winter.",
