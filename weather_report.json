    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the streets lie under a soft quilt of cloud, the night calm but not sparkling, as if the sky has rubbed its eyes and decided to keep them half-closed. There\u2019s a whisper of damp in the air and a hint that, toward dawn, a light shower will wander through. The scene is muted rather than clear, more watercolor than photograph, with streetlamps haloed and the horizon smudged. It feels gentle and a touch drowsy, a night for quiet company or a low lamp and a book.\n\nThe day looks set to begin with a grey, lightly wet start before any brighter patches consider breaking through. If the sun edges out later, expect the light to sharpen quickly and the UV to climb fast, as it does here in late spring, so plan a hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses even if the morning starts shy. Dress in easy layers and keep a compact umbrella or light rain jacket by the door; closed shoes will spare you the damp. Early errands, a caf\u00e9 table by the window, or an unhurried visit to the market make sense; save the longer walk or bike ride for a break in the clouds, when the air turns fresh and the day, finally, clears its throat.",
