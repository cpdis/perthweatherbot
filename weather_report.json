    "weather_report": "In the soft darkness of Subiaco's early hours, the sky remains cloaked with a tapestry of broken clouds, gently scattering the persistent glow of distant stars and a waning moon. As the night yields its subtle grip, the first hints of dawn murmur promises of a day peeking through interludes of scattered clouds. While sunshine may dance sporadically down cobbled streets and lush gardens, expect a play of light and shadow that will render the day neither glaringly bright nor dull. The UV index leans on the moderate side, inviting you to cautiously venture out without the vise of harsh rays nipping at your skin. \n\nThe cool morning air suggests a comfortable pairing of light layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater or a comfortable jacket\u2014as the hours will balance the ebb and flow between warmth and a fresh breeze. It is the kind of morning where a stroll through a leafy park or a quiet sit at a caf\u00e9 captures the heart of the day, allowing serene reflection or gossamer moments of contentment. The mood is laid-back, teasing summer's promise as hints of spring linger. So, delve into the calm routine, whether that means reading a novel outdoors or taking a gentle walk to observe the world awakening softly, one step at a time.",
