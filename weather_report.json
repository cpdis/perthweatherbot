    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere wraps itself in a thick embrace of clouds and rain as dawn begins to wrestle with the darkness. The steady patter of raindrops offers a rhythmic backdrop, hinting at the city\u2019s slumbering vitality, as the current temperature lingers around a chill that nudges closer to 47 degrees. The forecast, unwavering in its certainty, promises that today will be a continuation of this wet symphony, with the high barely cresting 57 and then descending as the day wears on. The air is dense and humid, a precursor to the forecasted rain that will accumulate, painting the streets in glistening reflections of the cityscape.\n\nVisibility is cloaked in a near fog-like haze, creating an ethereal softness around familiar landmarks, with the marine layer heavy to the west, guarding the mysteries of the bay. As the rain persists, one can best navigate this day wrapped in layers\u2014perhaps a warm coat, sturdy footwear, and an umbrella to fend off the relentless droplets. While the weather may not invite to stroll along the waterfront, one might find solace in the quietude of a local caf\u00e9 or a cozy bookstore, savoring the tranquil rhythm of rain against the windowpanes while the city breathes its silvery, damp charm.",
