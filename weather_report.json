    "weather_report": "As the quiet hours of the night embrace Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds blankets the sky, casting a soft, muted light over the city's iconic skyline. The serene chill of the late night settles at a cozy 49 degrees, brushed by a whisper of wind from the south-southeast. The air is crisp, inviting a moment of reflection as the city readies itself for the subtle dance of dawn.\n\nSunday promises a blend of fleeting drizzles in the early morning, potentially brushing the city briefly between seven and eight, before giving way to a sun that lifts the veil to reveal a mostly bright and cheerful day. With temperatures climbing near 60 yet falling slightly by afternoon, the morning might greet you with a cool touch, while later hours beckon a light-layered approach to your wardrobe. Perhaps a cardigan, paired with a light scarf, would serve well, allowing for comfort as the warmth of the sun gradually unfolds. \n\nAs you navigate this day, consider sauntering through the park, where the greenery glistens with refreshing droplets; an afternoon stroll by the waterfront could be particularly enchanting as the bay reflects the soft hues of autumn light. While the fog may cling to the coast, obscuring the Golden Gate Bridge momentarily, it only enhances the city's mystical charm. This is no day to be cooped up; instead, embrace the unfolding beauty of San Francisco\u2019s natural canvas and let the cool breezes guide your adventure.",
