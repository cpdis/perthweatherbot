    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into early afternoon with the streets still lightly rinsed from a passing morning shower and a ceiling of scattered cloud beginning to fray. Light softens and brightens by turns as the sun slips between patches, giving the day a silvery-blue cast; when it breaks through, expect a touch of warmth and a UV bite that\u2019s modest in shade but assertive in open sun. The air feels newly washed, edges of buildings a little crisper, distant lines clearer, though a few stray sprinkles can\u2019t be ruled out.\n\nDress in light layers and comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind a damp footpath; tuck a compact umbrella in your bag and keep sunglasses handy for those bright intervals. A dab of sunscreen is wise if you\u2019ll linger outdoors. It\u2019s a day for unhurried errands, a late caf\u00e9 lunch by a window, or a gentle loop through the neighborhood once the pavement dries. If you\u2019re staying in, throw open a window, let the cool, clean air travel the rooms, and sort a small task that thrives on good light and a calm mood.",
