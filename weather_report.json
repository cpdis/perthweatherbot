    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds drapes the city, merging with the cool embrace of the marine air. The prospect of rain lingers in the atmosphere, a 50% chance hinting at fleeting showers that might come to greet the night. Beneath the soft glow of streetlamps, temperatures hover around a comfortable 52 degrees. The mild south-southwest breeze nudges through the streets, a whisper of warmth mingled with the hint of moisture in the air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the weather promises more of the same, with a high near 58, as the city prepares for another day of dense cloud cover and the possibility of light rain. As temperatures dip into the afternoon, one may find themselves wrapped in layers, perhaps a soft sweater paired with a light jacket, ready to enjoy a leisurely stroll or a quiet afternoon in a cozy caf\u00e9. The talk of rain may cast a muted tone over outdoor plans, but there\u2019s something calming about the rhythm of city life under such gray skies\u2014ideal for browsing quaint bookstores or indulging in a warm drink while watching the world pass by, enriched by the unique charm these conditions bestow upon the shimmering streets.",
