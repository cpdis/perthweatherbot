    "weather_report": "A clear, quiet pre-dawn sits over Subiaco, the air gentle and unhurried, the sky rinsing from charcoal to pale blue. Visibility looks clean and sharp, with no hint of cloud to smudge the morning once the sun lifts; it promises one of those bright, straightforward days where light finds every corner.\n\nExpect a sun-drenched morning that turns quickly from pleasant to assertive, with UV climbing fast through late morning and staying formidable into the afternoon. Dress for ease and glare: light fabrics, sunglasses, a wide-brim hat, and sunscreen; carry water and keep to shade when you can. It\u2019s a good day to step out early\u2014hang a load of washing while the air is still kind, walk to a caf\u00e9 before the light gets hard, or run a few errands on quiet streets. By midday, let the day blaze outside while you retreat to a library table, a tidy of the pantry, or a slow lunch near a fan; step back out as the light softens toward evening.",
