    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Bend, a low, unbroken ceiling of cloud mutes the town\u2019s edges and keeps the stars at bay. The morning is set to stay gray, with overcast skies holding through mid to late morning, so don\u2019t expect much in the way of sunshine. UV will be minimal under this thick blanket, and daylight, when it comes, will feel soft and flat, the sort that erases shadows and quiets the landscape. It\u2019s the kind of sky that asks for patience rather than bravado.\n\nDress in layered warmth\u2014a cozy sweater under a heavier coat, a hat, and gloves to keep the chill from creeping in. This looks like a day for small, steady comforts: a brisk neighborhood loop to wake the lungs, then errands while the streets are empty, or a lingering visit to a bakery when it opens. If you crave motion, a late-morning walk along the river will feel contemplative under the muted light; otherwise, stay inside, sort a drawer, queue up a record, and let the gray set an easy tempo.",
