    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Subiaco, the sky is rinsed clear and quiet, the sort of night where porch lights seem too bright and the stars do their own whispering. The air feels gentle and clean, lending the streets a soft clarity that invites sleep or a last, unhurried glance from the balcony.\n\nForecasts keep the sky clear through the small hours, so sunrise should arrive untroubled, with sunlight sharpening quickly and the UV ramping up fast through the morning in this early-summer stretch. It looks like a pleasant start if you\u2019re up early: a light layer now, then switch to breathable clothes, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen once the day brightens. Consider an unhurried walk to the bakery as the town stirs, water the garden before the glare sets in, hang the wash to catch the first rays, or stroll to run a small errand while the shade still reaches across the footpaths. By late morning, keep to the gentler edges of the day\u2014seek patches of shade and let the bright hours work for you, not against you.",
