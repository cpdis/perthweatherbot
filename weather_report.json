    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun hangs brightly over the city, casting soft shadows across streets that pulse with the energy of everyday life. The forecast of high 59 degrees brings a mild embrace, giving way to a gradual drop into the evening. A gentle north wind stirs, carrying with it whispers of crispness, ideal for a stroll along the waterfront or beneath the sprawling trees in Golden Gate Park. Despite the sun's bold presence, a thin veil of lingering cloud cover hints at the marine layer's watchful eye, particularly as one gazes towards the horizon where the ocean meets the sky.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the clouds will deepen, swathing the city in a coolness that drops to around 46 degrees. A lightweight jacket will be your companion, perfect for braving the evening air. With the clear afternoon inviting exploration, take a leisurely wander through the Mission District's vibrant murals or savor a quiet moment in one of the many cozy restaurants, where warm meals await to wrap you in comfort. Sunset promises its own distinct beauty, painting the sky as the world begins to settle into the rhythm of night.",
