Expect the day to stay mostly sunny through late morning, with a soft quilt of scattered clouds wandering in after lunch that won\u2019t do much to blunt the light. UV will climb quickly and stay fierce through midday, so this is a hat-and-sunscreen sort of day; sunglasses and a light, breathable layer will feel right as the air warms.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant, clear day for simple things done at an easy pace: a stroll to pick up bread and greens, hanging the washing so it dries in no time, a book and a long glass of water at a shaded caf\u00e9 table, or a short ride to the library while the streets are still quiet. Open the windows, let the clean brightness through, and keep to the shade when the sun turns insistent.",
