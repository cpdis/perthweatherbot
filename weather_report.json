    "weather_report": "Rottnest settles under a quiet, ink-blue sky, the night soft with scattered cloud and the hush that follows the last ferry. Stars wink through the gaps, and the air carries that cool, salty nip that makes you tuck your hands into your sleeves. UV is essentially absent now, and the island feels unhurried, a good hour for listening to the water lap at the jetty and the breeze tease the casuarinas.\n\nToward dawn those patchy clouds should linger as decoration rather than threat, letting ribbons of sunshine through; the day looks clear-leaning and bright, with visibility crisp and colors clean. Expect a cool start that edges toward comfortably mild; light layers will serve you best, a windproof shell for early rides, and by late morning, hat and sunscreen as the spring sun wakes fast and UV climbs to moderate, possibly strong. This is a day for unhurried circuits by bike, pausing at a quiet cove to watch the light change; for a coffee on the veranda while the island yawns awake; for a lighthouse amble or a notebook and a shaded bench, letting the hours do the talking.",
