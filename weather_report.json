    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a clean, unsmudged sky at midday, the kind of light that sharpens edges and turns gum leaves glossy. The sun has bite now; expect a bright, sun-drenched afternoon to stay clear right through late day, with the glare easing only toward early evening. UV will be strong in the early afternoon before it softens, so shade is your friend, and the day reads as crisp and uncomplicated\u2014no drama, just clarity.\n\nDress for brightness: breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a reliable sweep of sunscreen; keep water close. It\u2019s a good time for a lazy walk to the shops, a quiet lunch in a shaded courtyard, or hanging the washing while the light does its swift work. Save the garden watering for later when the sun steps back, and perhaps reward the day with a short, unhurried errand on foot as the light mellows.",
