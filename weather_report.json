    "weather_report": "North Perth wakes under a low pewter lid, the light soft and a little blue around the edges. Showers gather through the late morning and settle into a steadier rain by midafternoon, the sort that polishes leaves and blurs the far end of the street. Sunshine will be rare today, more a fleeting glimmer than a companion, and while the UV is muted by cloud, midday in spring can still nip at exposed skin if a gap opens. Expect a day of glistening pavements, softened horizons, and the hush that comes when rain finds its rhythm.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for easy layers and a light waterproof, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and a pocket umbrella if you like to keep your hands free. If you need to run errands, the sooner the better before the rain gets confident; otherwise, claim a warm seat by a caf\u00e9 window, browse a bookshop, or tend to small domestic rituals\u2014the sort that feel right with the percussion of rain on the roof. If you do step out around lunchtime, a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t be wasted.",
