    "weather_report": "The morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco under a blanket of gray, the clouds heavy with the threat of rain. A cool chill clings to the air, whispering a reminder to check your umbrella as you step outside. The forecast promises a day where the sky weeps gently, with temperatures hovering around the mid-50s, kissed by a light northeast breeze. The streets, already shimmering from the early showers, reflect the muted light, creating a dreamy atmosphere that hints at a more subdued kind of beauty.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect the rain to persist, slowly accumulating along the sidewalks, clever in its ability to linger just below your expectations. Visibility may dance with the fog that wraps around the hills, softening the sharp lines of the iconic skyline, where the Golden Gate Bridge seems to blend seamlessly with the horizon. In such a weathered landscape, one might find solace in the cozy corners of a local caf\u00e9, enjoying a warm drink while the world outside takes on a melancholic charm.\n\nLayering is advisable; a comfortable jacket over a soft sweater will guard against the dampness while giving you a welcoming embrace on this chilly day. Consider a stroll through the quieter streets, perhaps exploring the art galleries or indulging in a leisurely lunch at a favorite nook that invites you to linger. This is not a day for hurry, but rather a chance to enjoy the marvel of San Francisco's character on a rainy afternoon.",
