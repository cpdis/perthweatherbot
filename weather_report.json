The low temperatures hover gently around 51 degrees, allowing a crispness to permeate the air that invigorates the senses. There\u2019s a slight breath of a northeast wind, whispering softly through the streets, elevating the enchanting vibe of the night. Looking ahead to tomorrow, the sun is poised to grace the city with its warm embrace, reaching a comfortable high near 67 before retreating gently into the cooler afternoon hours.\n\nThe absence of fog creates a clarity that invites exploration. With the marine layer retreating, this evening's activities can meander outside under a celestial blanket. It\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps pausing to take in the reflection of city lights shimmering on the bay's surface. Dressed in layers, a light jacket should suffice for the chill of night, while a warmer ensemble will be wise for tomorrow\u2019s sunny disposition, balancing comfort with the day's expected warmth. The evening calls for simple pleasures\u2014a casual outing with a close friend or perhaps a moment to sip a warm drink while watching the last embers of sunset melt into the horizon.",
