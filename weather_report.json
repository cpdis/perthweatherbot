    "weather_report": "As the early hours of a new day unfurl over Downtown San Francisco, the sky is graced with tranquility and clarity. Overnight temperatures have settled comfortably around 55, and the north northwest winds whistle softly, occasionally challenging the stillness with gusts that stir the air at up to 33 miles per hour. The first light of Monday promises sunshine, with the day advancing towards a gentle warmth of nearly 68 degrees, tapering slightly into the afternoon as it dances down to a pleasant 64.\n\nWhile the night has passed without the oppressive embrace of fog, the fresh breeze brings a crispness, heralding a bright day. The golden rays of sun will illuminate the iconic skyline, creating a picturesque backdrop against which the buildings stand proud and inviting. Dress lightly in layers; a light jacket against the morning chill and perhaps a comfortable tee for the afternoon warmth should suffice. This is a day to explore. Perhaps meander through Golden Gate Park, find a cozy caf\u00e9 on a sunlit terrace, or indulge in some leisurely browsing at a local bookstore, allowing yourself to be swept away by both the day\u2019s warmth and the city\u2019s indomitable spirit.",
