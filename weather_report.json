    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into evening under a mostly clear dome, only a few loose clouds wandering past as the light thins. The forecast holds steady through late night much the same: clean, open sky and no threat of rain. With the sun well down, the UV index has fallen away to nothing, and the air has that lucid, see-far quality that makes streetlights look crisp and the first stars easy to spot.\n\nIt\u2019s a quietly pleasant night, made for small, ordinary things done unhurriedly. A light layer or soft sweater will suit the breeze; comfortable shoes will meet dry footpaths. Take a gentle loop around the block, water the herbs, or sit on the verandah and let the warmth drain from the day while the magpies settle. If you\u2019re saving a chapter for later, crack a window and read to the hush. The sun will have more edge again once morning brightens, but for now the night is kind.",
