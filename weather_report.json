    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the mood of the day oscillates between quiet contemplation and the promise of a gentle rain. As afternoon settles, there\u2019s a scattering of sunbeams peeking through the clouds, though the feeling is more muted than vibrant. Highs will hover around 59 degrees, with a slight drop as the evening draws near. By nightfall, the city will wrap itself in a thicker cloak of clouds, softening edges and dulling colors, as raindrops begin to fall. The unmistakable scent of wet earth will weave through the streets, marking the transition as a brisk wind whispers through at about 12 mph, bringing with it gusts that can tease at 18 mph.\n\nThe outlook tonight holds a robust 90% chance of rain, so you may want to reach for a comfortable jacket and an umbrella, ensuring you remain dry on your evening strolls. The lower temperatures will call for layers; a cozy sweater under a weather-resistant layer will serve you well. The distant sound of rain against the pavement invites a slower rhythm to the streets, a perfect backdrop for enjoying a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or for losing oneself in the aisles of a nearby bookstore, where the pages turn silently against the evening hum. So, as the twilight deepens, embrace the tranquil sweep of the season, finding shelter in companionship or solitude as the city settles under a blanket of clouds and the first whispers of rain.",
