    "weather_report": "In the stillness of early morning, Downtown San Francisco sits enveloped in a delicate haze, a reminder of the persistent marine layer that softly caresses the city. The air is cool, filled with a promise of clarity while retaining that characteristic chill that hints at the ocean's proximity. As the sun rises, it will struggle to break through the clouds, resulting in a day that remains partially sunny yet subdued. The quiet whisper of the west-southwest wind, gentle and steady, assures a refreshing embrace as it brushes against one's skin.\n\nDressed in layers would be wise as the temperatures hover shyly between the forties and fifties throughout the day, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or an unhurried coffee on an inviting terrace. The dampness lingers, so a light jacket or sweater might be welcome companionship against the cool backdrop. As the afternoon lingers, the city offers a serene environment, ideal for wandering the local streets, perhaps discovering a hidden bookstore or indulging in a leisurely lunch, where the environment complements the comfort of warm flavors. Thus, one can savor a gentle day in the heart of the city, making the most of its understated charm amid the ever-present fog.",
