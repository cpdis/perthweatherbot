    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle symphony of rain softly taps against windows, heralding the arrival of a moist blanket of clouds. The air is cool, enveloped in a damp embrace with temperatures lingering in the low fifties. Visibility may be shrouded in a hazy mist as the city wakes beneath a thick layer of clouds, hinting at the omnipresent marine layer that often graces the heights of the Golden Gate. The rain, though persistent, promises only light amounts throughout the day, creating a mellow backdrop for the bustle of city life.\n\nAs the day advances, temperatures are expected to ease slightly, resting in the upper fifties by afternoon. The gusty winds swirling from the southeast may add a chill, reminding us that warm layers will be our best companions\u2014perhaps a sturdy coat, a comfortable scarf, and waterproof shoes. Consider indulging in the arts: a visit to one of the many inviting museums could offer refuge from the elements as well as nourishment for the soul. Alternatively, a warm drink in a cozy caf\u00e9 might provide the perfect antidote to the gray, offering both warmth and a moment of reflection.",
