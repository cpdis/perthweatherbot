    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the city is wrapped in a serene, mostly sunny embrace, though the veil of clouds hints at a shift in the weather. With temperatures gently hovering around 58 degrees, a slight chill prevails as the day transitions towards the late afternoon. The north-northwest breeze stirs the air, offering a whisper of freshness that contrasts with the impending rain. As evening approaches, the sky deepens in texture, cloaked in layers of grey that portend the rain set to arrive after 10 PM. \n\nThose venturing out might find the current clarity uplifting, a gentle prelude before the clouds gather fully. As the sun dips and night settles in, expect the temperatures to cool to about 51, with an increase as the night unfolds. A light jacket or a cozy sweater, perhaps paired with a scarf, will serve well against the chill that dances on the breeze. As the rain beckons, consider indulging in the simple pleasures of the moment\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through one of the nearby parks, a warm cup of coffee in hand, or the inviting embrace of a favorite book by the window as rain begins to patter softly against the glass.",
