    "weather_report": "Cottesloe slips into night under a sky wiped clean, the air cool and salt-tinted, the horizon pared back to silhouettes. The forecast holds steady with clear skies late this evening and into the small hours, so expect a crisp, star-pricked calm rather than drama. It\u2019s pleasant in a quiet, restorative way\u2014no haze, no fuss\u2014just the hush of waves and the occasional gull. With the sun down, UV is essentially nil; when it returns, the lack of cloud means bright, unfiltered light and a spring UV that rises quickly.\n\nDress for an easy coastal night: a light jumper or windbreaker over short sleeves, sandals if you don\u2019t mind cool paving, sneakers if you do. This is the hour for modest comforts\u2014an unhurried foreshore stroll, a bench and a thermos, windows cracked to let the house breathe, a dog walk that runs a little longer because the sky is so clear. If you\u2019re planning tomorrow outdoors, line up hat, sunnies, and sunscreen; tonight, simply let the clarity do its quiet work.",
