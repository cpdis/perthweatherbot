    "weather_report": "As the clock gently drifts past 2 a.m. in Subiaco, the night air embraces the town with a serene whisper of scattered clouds, like the delicate flurry of an artist\u2019s brush across a canvas of deep indigo. The predawn quiet is wrapped in a quilt of soft celestial glow, promising subtle hints of daybreak\u2019s approach under a sky only lightly adorned with few clouds. Though the sun's full power slumbers, readying itself for tomorrow's noon showcase, today's sunlight will be a gentle unfolding rather than a glaring eruption, casting soft shadows upon winding streets and sloping verandas. The promise of lightness in the sky suggests hours touched by sunshine but moderated by subtle, translucent veils. The UV index may remain forgiving, making it an amiable day for ventures into life's quieter lanes. Dress in layers that flirt between the comfort of shade and sun\u2014the kind of attire that invites a gentle stroll through morning markets or a lazy amble along meandering paths. Consider an unhurried breakfast beneath the filtered morning light of a welcoming caf\u00e9 patio. Let the hours drift by in pursuit of calm pleasures, such as leafing through novels unopened on bedside tables or indulging in the beautiful monotony of a midweek pause in a city contentedly unfurling its daily rhythm.",
