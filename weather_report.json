    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a chill lingers in the air, drifting in from the south, wrapping the city in a veil of gray. The chance of rain makes itself known, casting an uncertain hue over the streets. Here, where the sun struggles to pierce the thickening cloud cover, the temperature hovers near 62 degrees, only to settle lower as the late afternoon edges toward evening. Winds whisper a soft murmur, brushing the rooftops at about six miles per hour, but as night approaches, they will pick up, ushering in a forecast of steady rain.\n\nBy nightfall, the city will transform under a blanket of rain, as the skies open up and deliver their payload, a guarantee of moisture that swathes the surroundings in a fresh, cleansing chill. With a low hovering around 53 and rising to a mild 55 overnight, the damp air will feel even cooler against exposed skin. It\u2019s a time for warm layers\u2014think cozy sweaters and waterproof shoes if you venture out. Tonight, when the rain pours down, the atmosphere invites quiet indoor pleasures: perhaps you might settle beside a window, lost in the pages of a book, or savor the deep flavors of a homemade stew. The streets, though slick and shimmering, offer a serene beauty beneath the rain\u2014a reminder that even in the grayest weather, there\u2019s a spirit of calm to be found.",
