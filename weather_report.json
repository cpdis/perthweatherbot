    "weather_report": "As the city settles into the evening, Downtown San Francisco is draped in a serene blanket of clarity, the stars beginning to twinkle overhead as the last vestiges of light fade. The sky remains untroubled by fog, a welcome reprieve from the usual marine haze, allowing the outlines of buildings and landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge to emerge distinctly against the darkening horizon. The air is crisp and cool, with a gentle breeze whispering from the southwest, nudging the temperature toward the chill of 46 degrees, a reminder of winter's embrace. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of a bright and sunny day lingers, though the warmth will be modest, capping near 58 degrees before settling into a cooler afternoon. A light north wind will lend a refreshing touch, inviting San Franciscans to venture outdoors. It's a lovely opportunity for a quiet stroll along Market Street or perhaps a leisurely visit to a nearby caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a steaming cup transcends the coolness of the air. Dress in layers to navigate the brisk morning chill, shedding outerwear as the sun casts its golden glow later in the day. As the evening beckons once again, let the beauty of the clear skies guide your steps, perhaps towards a moonlit reflection along the waterfront, where the city lights dance in the bay's gentle ripples.",
