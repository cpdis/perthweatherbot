    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night clings to a chill that speaks of impending rain. The sky, a shroud of gray, whispers promises of drizzle, already dribbling down in soft droplets. The air is heavy with humidity, wrapping the city in a damp embrace that seems almost alive. As the early hours stretch on, the distinct outline of the Golden Gate Bridge is obscured, tucked away within a thick marine layer that rolls off the Bay, cloaking landmarks in a veil of mystery. This is a day defined by tenacity, with a forecast calling for persistent rain, the kind that washes away frivolities and invites contemplation instead.\n\nAs the sun rises, expect a cascade of gray clouds to unfurl and unleash their bounty, ultimately drenching the streets of this beloved city. The high will linger around a brisk 55 degrees, nudging closer to the reality of the afternoon, where the temperature subtly declines. Wind will swirl through the streets at an ambivalent pace, gusting here and there, lending an energizing bite to the air. Given these conditions, one might reach for a warm knit sweater, a sturdy raincoat, and perhaps those loyal waterproof boots that will forsake the puddles. Today is one of those hidden treasures, encouraging you to duck into a local caf\u00e9, where the aromas of fresh coffee and sweet pastries mingle, as you rest from the weather outside. Or perhaps take a moment to wander through one of the city\u2019s legendary bookstores, perhaps snatching a novel to accompany you through the rain-soaked hours ahead, ensuring the day remains decidedly yours.",
