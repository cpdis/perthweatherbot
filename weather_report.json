    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco welcomes the day with a gentle clarity that hints at the sun\u2019s inevitable ascent. The low hovering around 48 degrees is a mere whisper from the warm embrace of 50 as the night breathes its final breaths. The north wind tugs softly at the city, a hint of coolness carried on wind gusts that dance playfully at 18 mph. The skies, unbroken and clear, invite the first light of morning.\n\nAs Friday unfolds, the sun will claim the stage, gracing the city with rays that warm the atmosphere to near 60, eventually settling into a soothing 55 by the afternoon. The west-northwest wind, ranging from a calm breeze to playful gusts, promises a delightful day out. Although the fog is unlikely to appear, the marine layer lurks not far beyond the bridge, offering a striking contrast when conditions shift. For those contemplating their attire, layering will be essential\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket for the morning chill, discarded by midday in favor of a simple tee as the sun reigns supreme. As the day progresses, why not take a leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods, savoring unwritten stories in charming cafes or indulging in the rich flavors of a hidden eatery? With skies bright and spirits high, the day beckons you outdoors to embrace the simple pleasures of life in San Francisco.",
