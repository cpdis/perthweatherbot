    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the city prepares for a evening enveloped in a tapestry of rain and fleeting thunderstorms, the remnants of which will linger through the early morning hours. A low of around 53 degrees invites a chill that, despite the rising temperatures, wraps itself around the shoulders like a familiar shawl. The southwest winds whistle softly, carrying whispers of the storm, with gusts promising a brisk taste of the elements. For those venturing outside, the suggestion is clear: layer thoughtfully. A light rain jacket paired with a comfortable sweater will shield against expected drizzle, while sturdy footwear can navigate the slick sidewalks.\n\nCome Saturday, the skies will offer a glimpse of blue, as the rain clouds retreat to pave the way for a sunny day. Yet, morning drizzle may delicately whisper reminders of the night's storms before giving way to warmth peaking at around 63 degrees. The northwesterly winds will bring a refreshing touch, inviting city dwellers to explore the streets. A leisurely stroll through the historic Mission District or a visit to one of the many outdoor caf\u00e9s would be a fitting choice, allowing a moment to inhale the crisp air and observe the awakening life of a city that holds its secrets close, revealing them gently with every change in weather.",
