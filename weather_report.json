    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a bright, sunny sky, the kind that promises warmth amidst an otherwise crisp atmosphere. As the gentle northeast wind flows, a refreshing chill fills the air, inviting yet unpredictable with gusts that dance through the heart of the city. The warmth is fleeting; temperatures peek around sixty-two before settling back to a cooler fifty-eight, a reminder that even in brightness, San Francisco retains its beguiling complexity.\n\nTonight, the clarity of the day will surrender to tranquil skies as temperatures dip into the low forties. Flashes of warmth will rise overnight, creating a curious interplay of cool nights and mildly balmy evenings, a sort of simultaneous embrace by the day and night. The absence of fog allows the city\u2019s charms to shine in all their clarity, the landscape boasting iconic views unmarred by the typical marine layer. In this lovely weather, those traversing the streets might find joy in light layers\u2014perhaps a stylish jacket or a cozy scarf could serve as elegant barriers against the evening's cool embrace. A stroll through the quieter corners of the city would be a fitting farewell to the day, where the golden hues of sunset might inspire a sense of peace and reflection on the winding streets.",
