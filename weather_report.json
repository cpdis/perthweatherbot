    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a soft, pewter sky, the morning light turned gentle by thickened cloud. The air is cool and a little damp, with the smell of wet pavement and jasmine lingering. Expect light showers to slant through late morning into the early afternoon, with only shy, fleeting breaks of sun. Visibility stays decent but the day will look smudged at the edges, reflections pooling in gutters. UV stays muted under cloud, nudging toward moderate if a bright gap opens near midday.\n\nDress in breathable layers with a light rain shell and comfortable shoes you don\u2019t mind getting speckled; a compact umbrella earns its keep today. It\u2019s a pleasant day for unhurried errands, a slow loop through the bookshop, or a coffee while the showers pass. If you\u2019re set on fresh air, time a short walk between bands of rain and let the streets shine around you, then head home for a simple, warming lunch and the quieter jobs waiting on the kitchen table.",
