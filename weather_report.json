    "weather_report": "As morning breaks over Subiaco, the remnants of the light rain from the predawn hours are slowly evaporating, leaving in their wake a rich, earthen aroma as the town awakens. The sky, once painted with somber shades of gray, is now adorned with a palette of scattered clouds, a testament to the whims and whimsy of Mother Nature. Nestled now between dawn and midday, the day holds promises of nuanced beauty, with the certainty of occasional sunlight making fleeting cameos amidst the cavorting clouds.\n\nAs the hours unfold, it is wise to dress with layers - light enough to bask in the shy sunlight and warm enough to ward off the nippy undercurrent characteristic of a rain-washed day. It's the kind of day tailor-made for a cup of coffee in hand, walking down to the local cafe, savouring the sense of calm that the rain imbued night has gifted. Perhaps, the charm of the day lies not in glaring sunshine or a blinding blueness but rather in its changing moods, urging you to read that book which has been waiting at your bedside or write that letter long due. Whatever be your chosen routine today, the weather in Subiaco supports it with a gentle, unperturbing consistency.\n\nHTML color code:",
