    "weather_report": "Midnight settles over Burswood with a damp hush; cloud hangs low and the air smells faintly of wet pavement. Light rain is expected to drift through the small hours and toward first light, softening the edges of the streets and keeping the stars at bay. It won\u2019t be sunny before morning, and the UV index is negligible now; after sunrise, if the cloud thins, expect the UV to assert itself quickly, though any lingering showers will keep the day feeling muted and pearly rather than bright.\n\nDress for the gentle nuisance: light layers with a waterproof shell, closed shoes that won\u2019t mind a few puddles, and something dry to change into if you\u2019re up early. It\u2019s a night for unhurried things \u2014 queue tomorrow\u2019s errands, tidy a corner, or let a podcast accompany you to sleep \u2014 and, for the early riser, a quiet walk under a hood when the rain eases, the river looking polished and subdued.",
