    "weather_report": "As evening cloaks Downtown San Francisco, a quiet anticipation hangs in the air, the city preparing to be washed anew by rain. The chill settles comfortably around 53 degrees, with a hint of warmth sneaking in as temperatures nudge upward through the night. A gentle south wind whispers through the streets, promising to caress umbrellas as they open in defiance of the 100% chance of rain. Tonight\u2019s precipitation will arrive steadily, with the promise of a nourishing quarter to half an inch to rejuvenate the landscape. The clouds above loom heavy and gray, their presence obscuring the charm of the city skyline, leaving little room for the sunlight to filter through.\n\nTomorrow will awaken with more rain, an encore that promises to persist before giving way to scattered showers and the occasional clap of thunder. The day will strive to reclaim clarity after 10 a.m., but expect the warmth of sunshine to wane into a cool 59 degrees, falling gradually as the afternoon unfolds. The winds will shift noticeably, ushering in a brisk westward flow that stirs the ocean air, hinting at the marine layer hovering nearby, ever present, shrouding the Golden Gate in a ghostly veil.\n\nConsidering the weather, simple layers will serve you best; a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes will guide you through this wet city. An umbrella is a wise companion as well, essential for navigating the intimate corners of your favorite caf\u00e9 or cozy bookstore, perfect haunts for a rainy day. The nightlife may beckon with a warm drink in hand, or perhaps indulging in a leisurely stroll, the streets glistening from the rain, where the muffled sounds of distant laughter and conversation echo, creating a melody all their own beneath the muted sky.",
