The chill of the night embraces the city, dipping to a refreshing low as if inviting the calm to hold you close. The forecast hints at a sunny awakening come morning, yet for now, the urban landscape is ablaze with the warm flicker of lights, casting an inviting glow against the slate of night.\n\nTomorrow beckons under a mostly sunny veil, presenting a high that encourages a leisurely pace in the afternoon sun, while the breeze remains a soothing companion. While the fog's gentle hands seem absent tonight, it\u2019s a reminder that the marine layer could always make a swift appearance. As you venture out, consider layering your attire\u2014a light jacket kissed by the faintest warmth of the day will ensure comfort, whether you find yourself navigating bustling streets or basking in the golden shadows cast by the buildings. The tranquil ambiance suggests simple pleasures\u2014perhaps indulge in a stroll along the waterfront or savor a warm brew at a local caf\u00e9 while watching the interplay of light and shadow dance along the Bay.",
