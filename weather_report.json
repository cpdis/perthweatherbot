    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco finds itself nestled under a quilt of clouds, whispering the possibility of rain before the dawn breaks. As the clock ticks toward morning light, the air feels cool and damp with a breath of southern wind, carrying the promise of a gentle drizzle. The temperature hovers comfortably around fifty-six degrees, encapsulating the city in a soft embrace, yet hinting at the chill that often lingers in winter's wake. \n\nAs Monday unfolds, expect a lingering grayscape, with glimpses of clouds shifting in the light. Though the chance for rain ebbs as the day progresses, its shadow remains, casting a slight chance of precipitation throughout the hours of late morning and afternoon. Pleasantly brisk air invites layers; a light jacket and scarf are ample companions for a stroll through the streets, where the muted colors of the city meld into a soft monochrome. Plan your day to wander through quieter corners of the Bay, perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or a leisurely perusal of local shops, all while the world looks on, wrapped in its fog-kissed mystery.",
