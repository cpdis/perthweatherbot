    "weather_report": "Midday in Leederville arrives bright and uncomplicated, the sun steady above and only a scattering of high, decorative cloud expected through the early afternoon before the sky rinses to a clean blue toward evening. Light feels crisp and generous, the kind that bounces off verandas and shopfront glass; the UV is punchy now, gentler later as shadows lengthen. Air and visibility look clear, a day built for simple errands and unhurried steps.\n\nIt reads as a pleasant day if you dress for the glare: light layers, breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat and sunglasses, with sunscreen as your quiet companion. Consider a late lunch in a shaded courtyard, a slow loop on foot around Lake Monger, or a quick browse through local grocers and bookshops before the afternoon burns off the last wisps of cloud. If home calls, throw open a window, let the sun dry a fresh load of washing, and set a plant by the sill to drink in the calm.",
