    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a quiet, open sky and just a few clouds unhurriedly passing through. The air feels clean and steady, good for breathing deeply; visibility is crisp, and the last warmth of the day has slipped away. Sunshine is done for now, of course, and the UV index has fallen to near nothing, leaving the night gentle and low-key.\n\nFor the rest of the evening and into the small hours, expect that same mostly clear canvas with a light, occasional veil of cloud. It looks pleasant rather than bracing: a night for a light sweater or an easy jacket if you wander out. Take a slow walk after dinner, give the dog a longer loop, or linger on the porch with a book while the neighborhood softens around you. If you\u2019re preparing for tomorrow, set out your bag by the door and enjoy the calm; after sunrise, the light will return, but for now it\u2019s a clear, unhurried night.",
