    "weather_report": "Morning settles over Galveston with only a few harmless clouds drifting by, the light clear and forgiving. Skies have been mostly clean since the night hours, and the day leans sunny; expect a bright, open feel with just passing patches of cloud. The UV index will stay tame for December but not trivial, nudging to moderate around midday when the sun finds its stride. Air clarity looks good, colors a little sharper than usual, the sort of morning that makes windows feel bigger.\n\nIt should be a pleasant day to move about: comfortable rather than sultry, with a hint of cool if you\u2019re near the water. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light sweater or long sleeves you can shed by noon\u2014plus sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019re out toward lunchtime. Good weather for a slow stroll along the Seawall, a coffee on a quiet patio, a browse through the bookshop, or a few unhurried errands by bike before the afternoon gets busy.",
