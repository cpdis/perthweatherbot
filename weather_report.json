A light north northeast wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it a hint of the ocean's breath\u2014an echo of the fog that will creep in later tonight, wrapping the city in its familiar embrace. \n\nThe morning sky, a clear blue canvas, is gradually revealing its character, while the fog remains mostly at bay, only teasing the edges of the city. As the sun reaches its zenith, expect the temperature to dip slightly into the mid-fifties, signaling a perfect moment for light layers\u2014a sweater or a light jacket paired with comfortably worn jeans would be ideal. Today is suited for quiet walks along Embarcadero, perhaps stopping for a warmed coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where you can savor the tranquil ambiance. Alternatively, a visit to one of the nearby parks, enveloped by the allure of morning light, offers a chance to breathe deeply, as the city awakens and stirs all around you.",
