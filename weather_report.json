    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks softly over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to an embrace of golden sunlight and crisp air, with a charm reminiscent of a classic Sunday morning. The temperature lingers comfortably in the low sixties, soon to dip slightly as the day advances. A gentle north-northwest wind accompanies the rays, adding a brisk edge that hints at the chilly embrace still settling over the bay. The skies above are remarkably clear, offering unobstructed vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge and the rolling hills beyond, without the usual veil of fog that often adorns the mornings here.\n\nWith the sun's warmth becoming more pronounced throughout the day, apparel choices lean towards light layers, perfect for enjoying a stroll through one of the city\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods or perhaps indulging in the flavors of local cafes. The absence of fog and mist unlocks the potential for leisurely explorations\u2014the kind that invites one to pause, absorb the architecture of Victorian homes, or indulge in a moment of quiet reflection at a windswept park. As evening falls, expect a cool retreat into the forties, a gentle reminder that even the sunniest days in San Francisco carry the whisper of the ocean breeze, making a cozy wrap or a lightweight jacket a wise companion for those evening strolls beneath the clear, starlit sky.",
