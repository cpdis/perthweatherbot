    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into the late morning under a clear, glassy light, with only a scattering of tidy clouds promised to wander through the late morning and early afternoon. Expect a day that feels open and sun-forward, the sort where colors look scrubbed and edges crisp; UV will surge by midday, so treat the sun as a bright companion with sharp elbows. Dress light and breathable, add a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a confident layer of sunscreen; keep water handy if you\u2019re out for long. It\u2019s a pleasant day to move at an amble: fetch a coffee and circle the neighborhood, cycle a gentle errand run, read on a shaded veranda, or give the houseplants a slow drink while the light gathers. If you\u2019re heading out later, aim for pockets of shade as the afternoon ripens; the sky will stay mostly clean, the mood bright, the day kindly decisive.",
