    "weather_report": "Midday drifts in under a dappled sky, the sun shouldering through scattered clouds with a soft, silvery light. The day looks clear enough for shadows to come and go, bright rather than blazing, with no strong hint of rain. Expect a mostly sunny feel tempered by those passing veils, the UV still meaningful when the sun breaks free, the horizon clean and untroubled.\n\nComfort calls for light layers: a breathable shirt, something to toss over your shoulders if a breeze sneaks in, sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen for the brighter spells. It\u2019s a day for ordinary pleasures\u2014walking to the shops, lingering over a coffee by a window, tending a small task in the garden, or reading a few chapters on a park bench while the light sifts in and out. If you\u2019ve errands to run, do them now while the afternoon keeps its gentle clarity.",
