    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft haze clings to the air, hinting at the coming rain. Tonight's forecast whispers of light showers, brushing against the city with a gentle promise of moisture. The temperature lingers around a cool 44 degrees, gradually nudging up to a mild 46 overnight, all the while a northeast wind dances through the streets at a brisk pace, stirring a sense of anticipation in the atmosphere. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, there is a tentative hope for blue skies as the day unfolds, yet don\u2019t grow too comfortable\u2014shower possibilities remain until the afternoon. As the sun rises, it might illuminate the city in splashes of errant light, elevating spirits with a high near 56, before tapering off as the day progresses. The northeast winds may pick up, creating a fresh, almost invigorating feel as they gust through at up to 24 mph. For those venturing out, layered clothing accompanied by an umbrella would serve well against the unpredictable charm of December\u2019s whims. While the marine layer may obscure some views, the promise of sunshine invites strolls along less crowded streets or perhaps settling into a cozy nook at a local caf\u00e9, watching the world outside shift with the weather.",
