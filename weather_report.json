    "weather_report": "The weather in Downtown San Francisco today carries a certain chill and a hint of anticipation. As the clouds hang low, draping the city in a muted gray, there's a whisper of rain that piques the senses. Although the sun has made a shy attempt to break through the overcast, the day remains unyielding in its foggy embrace, particularly as one gazes northward toward the Golden Gate Bridge, peeking out from behind a veil of mist. The promise of rain is palpable, with moisture anticipated to coat everything in an intimate sheen, transforming the mundane into something almost ephemeral.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will deepen, ushering in a steady rain that will blanket the streets and soften the world outside. A breeze from the south carries with it the scent of the ocean and the skies seem to turn inward, wrapped tightly in their leaden layers. In such weather, one may find solace indoors, perhaps with a captivating book by the fire or a leisurely stroll through a nearby museum. Layered clothing is advisable: a warm sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, along with sturdy shoes to navigate any puddles that might form as the rain arrives. As the night deepens and temperatures rise gently, the atmosphere transforms, giving way to the promise of a cozy evening indoors.",
