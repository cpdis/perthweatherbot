    "weather_report": "The tranquil beauty of Subiaco awakens in the early hours of dawn with a velvet veil of light rain dappling the cobblestones. The previous evening's clear sky has gave way to an atmospheric ballet, where droplets pirouette from the heavens, a delicate pitter-patter echoing through the quiet town. As the day unfolds, clouds are expected to hang low in the sky, giving residents a soothing respite from the vibrant intensity of the sun. One feels utterly cocooned in this dimly lit yet poetically charming cradle.\n\nDressing for the day calls for a subtle blend of utility and elegance. An understated waterproof trench, perhaps paired with a touch of a fetching tartan scarf, adds a dash of color to the day's palette of soft grays. Footwear too, must be both practical and stylish - a sturdy pair of wellington boots offers not only a refuge from the rain but an opportunity to straddle puddles in a childlike defiance of the weather's grim demeanor. Today's weather effortlessly lends itself to quiet contemplation - be it with a book in a cozy corner caf\u00e9 or a solitary stroll through Subiaco's labyrinth of hushed streets and hidden piazzas. A pause in the mellow rain might also be an opportune moment to admire the rain-washed splendor of the town's architecture, revealing hues and nuances previously unseen.",
