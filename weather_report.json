    "weather_report": "As dawn gently unfurls its light over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the day with a calm demeanor, draped in a soft veil of clouds that foretell a pleasant, albeit cool, Washington's Birthday. The temperature, slightly brisk, hovers around the mid-fifties, and the air carries a touch of moisture reminiscent of the lingering marine layer. Visibility is good, allowing for glimpses of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge peeking through the thinning mist. The west northwest wind whispers between 5 to 12 mph, creating a harmonious backdrop to the city's vibrant morning symphony.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect the sun to flirt with the clouds, occasionally breaking through to reveal clearer skies\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a cozy meal in one of the many quaint eateries that dot the streets. Dress in layers today to navigate the morning chill and the anticipated rise in temperature by afternoon. A light sweater or jacket should suffice. This is a day for quiet explorations rather than grand excursions; possibly a visit to a local art gallery or sharing stories over coffee with a friend while the world awakens around you.",
