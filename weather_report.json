    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a gentle sun graces the city, casting long shadows and illuminating the charming streets with a warm glow. The high reaches a comfortable 62, with temperatures gradually dipping to a cooler 60 as the afternoon wears on, accompanied by a light west wind whispering at 10 to 14 mph. The sky is predominantly clear, punctuated by the occasional playful cloud that drifts lazily across the azure, a fitting backdrop to the iconic cityscape. Fortunately, there\u2019s little sign of fog today; the marine layer, usually draping parts of the coastline, appears to have taken a break, allowing the brilliance of the day to unveil its beauty in full.\n\nAs the evening beckons, the weather will transform slightly, inviting a mild round of partly cloudy skies and a low settling around 52, which may call for a light jacket as the warmth of the day gives way to the tranquility of night. In terms of attire, comfortable layers will ensure you are prepared for both the daytime warmth and the evening chill. Why not meander through the city, perhaps stopping by a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or enjoy a leisurely walk along the waterfront as the sun sets and the city lights begin to twinkle? It\u2019s a day that invites both activity and reflection, perfectly catering to those who desire a moment of calm amid the bustle of life.",
