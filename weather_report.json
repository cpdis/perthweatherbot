    "weather_report": "As the sun dips below the horizon, Subiaco finds itself wrapped in the gentle embrace of evening shadows. Having experienced a brush with light rain earlier, the earth is tenderly scented with petrichor, an earthy aroma that clings to the air. Broken clouds hang above, remnants of earlier weather, framing the onset of dusk with an intriguing tapestry of grey and cream. The day transitions into night without much fanfare or vibrant hues, lending a sense of mellow tranquility to the scene. Today\u2019s cloud cover might have slightly dimmed the sun's might, offering some respite from the harshness of its midday glare, though at this hour, the UV index ceases to be a concern.\n\nIn this tranquil slice of twilight, it feels right to step out in casual, comfortable attire\u2014a sweater perhaps, to fend off the mild chill that creeps in with the absence of daylight. The evening extends an irresistible invitation for a leisurely stroll, one where the cool breeze lightly tousles the hair and temporarily lifts the spirit with its serene song. For those seeking solace indoors, curling up with a book or engaging in gentle conversation over a steaming cup of tea might prove a delightful way to close out this day.",
