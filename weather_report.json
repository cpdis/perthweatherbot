    "weather_report": "As the afternoon descends gently into Subiaco, the sky is an artist's palette, an intriguing daub of scattered clouds that played their morning tune and then gave way to the soft percussion of light rain at noon. These seemingly timid clouds hover with the lightness of a whispered promise, hinting at occasional sunny interludes, but keeping any thought of intense sunshine at bay. The murky remnants of rain lend a certain coolness to the air, making it invigorating rather than oppressive, as sunshine filters through like treasured secrets. The UV index remains mercifully mild, inviting outdoor explorations rather than caution-taped confinement indoors. On a day that seems undecided between sunlit warmth and rainy whispers, opting for layered clothing\u2014a light sweater, perhaps a waterproof jacket\u2014would be the sartorially astute choice. As the clock sails past midday and Subiaco's streets glisten with a lustrous sheen, it might be a fine time to take a leisurely stroll through the local park, letting the residual droplets anoint your cheeks while the world brims with the fresh scent of post-rain nature. Reclining with a good book under the draping eaves of a caf\u00e9 would also suit the tempo of this day\u2014somewhere you can sip, read, and muse while the weather casts its spell.",
