    "weather_report": "Late afternoon settles over Fremantle with a mellow, salt-laced light slipping between scattered clouds. The day feels open and clear, the horizon crisp, sun softened rather than fierce. UV has eased toward the low end now, though it likely had a sharper bite earlier; sunglasses still earn their keep for the next hour, but the urgency fades as the sun slides down. The sky carries that gentle sheen that makes everything look a touch more forgiving.\n\nInto the early evening, the patchwork cloud remains, broken enough to promise a few warm glints and a clean dusk. It looks like a pleasant, unhurried few hours ahead, inviting light layers: a tee or linen shirt now, a thin jumper in your bag for later when the air thins out after sunset. Good time for small, ordinary things done slowly\u2014an amble to pick up bread, a quiet spin on the bike along side streets, watering the herbs, or taking your book to the porch to read the day out.",
