    "weather_report": "As the early hours of this morning settle over Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a shroud of rain and clouds, with the gentle patter of droplets creating a rhythmic backdrop to the stillness of the night. Temperatures hover in the low fifties, with mild gusts from the south bringing a briskness that commands a thoughtful choice in attire. Those venturing outdoors should bundle up in layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a waterproof jacket\u2014because the forecast promises persistent rain throughout the day, with the possibility of heavier downpours as clouds roll across the horizon.\n\nBy midday, the mercury will cling to the upper fifties, as the gray blanket overhead casts a muted light over the bustling streets. The air will feel damp, and visibility may wane, recalling memories of the soft marine layer that often graces this coastal expanse. Amidst the drizzle, one might consider indulging in a warm cup of coffee from one of the local caf\u00e9s, allowing the rich aroma to envelop them while watching the world go by or perhaps explore the shops lining the vibrant streets, where the glow of displays contrasts with the dim weather outside. Although the conditions may seem dreary, they offer a perfect excuse for a leisurely, contemplative day spent indoors, whether nestled in a cozy nook with a good book or indulging in the artistic offerings of nearby galleries.",
