    "weather_report": "Tonight, as the city sinks into twilight, a steady rain envelops Downtown San Francisco, shrouding the urban landscape in a thick, gray mist. The low temperature hovers around fifty degrees, and though the night air is cool, the rain offers a refreshing contrast, rising slightly as the hours pass. Wind gusts sweep in from the southeast, carrying with them the rhythmic patter of rain against rooftops, reaching speeds that lend an urgent thrill to the nocturnal ambiance. With certainty, the forecast assures us of persistent precipitation, suggesting an overnight accumulation that may well drench the city streets to the tune of two inches.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the city will awaken to a symphony of showers interlaced with fleeting thunderstorms, a crescendo that promises to mark the day with echoes of nature\u2019s voice. The high will only flirt with fifty-eight degrees before retreating to the cooler embrace of afternoon, enveloped again in a damp haze. The southwest wind will contribute a sharp bite, so dressing in layers\u2014perhaps a waterproof jacket under which one can find cozy warmth\u2014will be prudent. In such weather, it is less a day for grand endeavors and more a day for intimate explorations. A visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the steam from a warm cup of coffee can pierce the chill, or a stroll through the city\u2019s galleries will offer both shelter from the elements and the opportunity to appreciate the muted beauty that a rainy day can bring.",
