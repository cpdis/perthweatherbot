    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze stirs the chilly air, whispering of the partly cloudy skies ahead. The temperature sits around a brisk 46 degrees, with a north wind softening the sharp edges of the cool evening. Tomorrow greets San Francisco with bright, sunny moments, though the afternoon may find the city feeling a touch cooler as temperatures drift to near 54. A manageable northwest wind will accompany this clarity, allowing the lingering marine layer, likely dissipating by midday, to vanish, leaving room for that iconic Bay Area sunshine.\n\nAs you contemplate what to wear, layering is key; a warm jacket will shield against the evening's chill, paired with a comfortable, breathable top to accommodate the day's gradual warming. Tomorrow\u2019s promise of clarity and sunshine encourages exploration; perhaps take a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the glow of the city meets the lapping waves, or indulge in a leisurely brunch at one of the many cozy cafes in the Mission, savoring bites of roasted coffee and fresh pastries while inviting the day\u2019s beauty into your world.",
