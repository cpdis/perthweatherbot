    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the sun shines brightly upon the city, casting long shadows against the skyline while the afternoon unfolds in a gentle embrace of warmth. The air, crisp yet invigorating, carries a hint of the brisk north wind, stirring the leaves in a dance that hints at the coming evening chill. Despite the pleasant facade, a subtle reminder of the Bay's marine layer lingers in the distance, sparing some areas the full brilliance of the day. In particular, the vicinity of the Golden Gate Bridge remains cloaked in a soft haze, while the heart of the city basks in clarity.\n\nAs night approaches, the skies will remain mostly clear, transforming to welcome the chill that will settle around 49 degrees. It\u2019s wise to wear layers, opting for a light sweater or jacket to guard against the evening breeze. Tonight\u2019s conditions call for a leisurely walk along the waterfront, perhaps indulging in a warm cup of coffee or tea, embraced by the calm that only the city can conjure as it winds down. The promise of a clear evening sky offers a perfect chance to gaze upon the stars, a rare treat in urban life, while the distant sounds of the city create a soothing backdrop.",
