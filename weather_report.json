The air carries a hint of electricity\u2014a tangible anticipation of the rain expected to arrive after four, ushering in a modest chill. Temperatures linger around a cool 50, nudging gently upward as the hours pass, while a gentle wind whispers from the west-southwest.\n\nLooking towards tomorrow, expect a parade of precipitation, giving way eventually to patches of sun breaking through the gray. The high will flirt with 57, but as the rain wanes, the temperature will gradually fall again to a cooler 53. With the robust likelihood of rain reaching 90%, one would do well to keep a sturdy umbrella close, perhaps donning a water-resistant coat to keep the dampness at bay. For evening activities, a quiet stroll through the local art galleries or a snug evening spent in a cozy caf\u00e9 could prove delightful\u2014embracing the rhythm of a city that dances with the rain.",
