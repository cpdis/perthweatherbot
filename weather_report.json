    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a spotless sky, the kind that sharpens edges and turns every windowpane into a mirror. By late morning and on through mid\u2011afternoon the forecast holds to clear blue, sunlight vivid and insistent, with the sort of midday UV that bites quickly in late summer. Expect a day that feels crisp and luminous to the eye yet unforgiving in the open; shade will be the friendlier country, the air carrying that bright, almost metallic clarity that makes colors ring.\n\nDress lightly and sensibly: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, good sunglasses, and sunscreen you can trust; carry water and don\u2019t be shy about seeking awnings and trees when the sun climbs. This is a fine morning to walk your errands before noon, settle with a coffee at a quiet cafe patio, or slip into a bookshop\u2019s cool hush for an hour. Save any unhurried park stroll for the gentler edges of the day, keeping to the dappled paths, and if you\u2019re riding or gardening, plan short bursts with generous pauses in the shade.",
