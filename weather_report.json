    "weather_report": "Katy wakes under a quiet, pre-dawn lid of cloud, the streets still holding last evening\u2019s damp like a memory. The sky is fractured rather than clear, more pewter than pearl, and the air feels gentle, unrushed. Sun won\u2019t have much to say at first; expect a muted sunrise with only occasional pale breaks. UV is essentially asleep now and will stay modest later unless the ceiling thins. Visibility is steady but softened at the edges, as if the town is taking its time to come into focus.\n\nDress with easy layers and a light jacket, and choose shoes that don\u2019t mind a wet curb. An umbrella can rest by the door; you probably won\u2019t need it, but the sky keeps its own counsel. For this hour, a simple routine fits: a slow walk around the block to hear the quiet tires of the world, a fresh pot of coffee, maybe an early errand while the day is still cool. Let the morning be practical and unhurried, ready to brighten if the clouds allow.",
