    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere today is draped in a blanket of muted greys, reflecting an afternoon that leans towards the cool and cloudy. The temperature resides comfortably in the mid-fifties, but a gentle south-southwest wind stirs softly, keeping the air crisp and enlivened. As daylight wanes, the clouds continue to gather, hinting at the rain that will arrive later in the evening. With a 90% chance of precipitation set to begin around 10 PM, it's clear that staying indoors might soon be the preferred option for many.\n\nThe cityscape features a veil of low clouds down by the bay, with hints of a marine layer swirling gently around the edges of the Golden Gate Bridge, beckoning those inclined to wander along its paths. Today, warmth lies in layers: a light jacket is advisable, perhaps with a cozy sweater underneath to counter the occasional chill. For those daring to embrace the murky beauty, a stroll through the serene stretches of Golden Gate Park or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit downtown can be delightful ways to savor the day before the rain forces retreat indoors. A quiet contemplation over a warm drink might just be the perfect counterpoint to the looming clouds overhead.",
