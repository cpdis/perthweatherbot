    "weather_report": "After a quiet, lightly clouded dawn and a small-hours sprinkle, Katy eases into early afternoon under a changeable sky. Expect sun to slip in and out from behind scattered clouds rather than blaze; in December the UV tends to be gentle to moderate, rising a touch if the cover thins, but nothing like summer\u2019s sharpness. The air should feel clear between patches of cloud, with any stray drips more of a soft interruption than a soak, making the day modestly pleasant if not dazzling. Dress in light layers with a thin jacket you can shed, and keep a compact umbrella handy just in case. This is good weather for ordinary errands done at an unhurried pace, a bookstore browse, a coffee you actually sit with, or a short neighborhood loop when the light looks kind. If you\u2019re sensitive to sun, a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go amiss, though today\u2019s light is more silvery than stern.",
