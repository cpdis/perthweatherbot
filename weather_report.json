The cool air whispers of the warmth to come, promising a mostly sunny day ahead. By midday, the sun will rise, illuminating the streets and mirroring the bay\u2019s glistening surface, though cool breezes from the northwest persist, reminding us of the ocean's proximity.\n\nWhile fog may not dominate the skyline today, the remnants of the coastal marine layer linger in the wispy edges of visibility, particularly near the Golden Gate Bridge, where the horizon meets a gentle haze. As you prepare for the day, layering is advisable; a light sweater over a T-shirt would be prudent, allowing you to adjust effortlessly to the changing temperatures as the sun ascends. This is a day to relish the simple pleasures\u2014perhaps a stroll through the city\u2019s vibrant streets or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, the aroma of fresh coffee hanging in the air as you soak in the sights around you. As the hours progress, the crisp clarity of the day will invite you to explore, offering a perfect backdrop for mundane yet enriching experiences.",
