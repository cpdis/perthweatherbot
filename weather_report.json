    "weather_report": "As the moonlight dances over the hills of San Francisco, tonight\u2019s clear skies cast a gentle glow on the city\u2019s iconic skyline. The air is crisp, with a low around fifty-one degrees, accompanied by a whisper of a south-southwest breeze. The stillness hints at a serene evening, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the soft lapping of the bay against the shore might serenade your thoughts.\n\nTomorrow beckons with the promise of a sunny day, reaching heights near sixty-five before drifting gently to around sixty-one in the afternoon. Expect a light south wind, keeping the air fresh and invigorating. With the clarity that defines this remarkable city, the day invites you to explore; perhaps wandering through the Mission District to discover charming cafes and vibrant murals could provide the perfect backdrop for a day out. Dress in layers to embrace the cool morning air, but be ready to shed those layers as the sun warms the streets. As you sip on your favorite coffee or tea, let the essence of a San Francisco day fill your soul with calm and joy.",
