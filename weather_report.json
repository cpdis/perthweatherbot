    "weather_report": "As night drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of mostly cloudy skies takes hold, keeping temperatures cool and comfortable, hovering around 46 degrees. The gentle north-northeast breeze breathes softly at about 7 mph, a whisper of air that invites a cozy evening. The horizon remains somewhat obscured, suggesting hints of the marine layer still lingering in the valleys, while streetlights flicker like stars, dancing slowly in the soft, muted glow against the darkening backdrop.\n\nTomorrow promises a contrast, as the city is set to wake under mostly sunny skies that will lift spirits and herald a high near 60 degrees. As daylight advances, the chill will subtly retreat, settling closer to 57 in the early afternoon; a perfect opportunity for a leisurely stroll through the nearby parks or a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9. Dress in layers; a light jacket will ward off the morning freshness, but as the sun peeks out, it will be wise to shed those layers and embrace the warmth. With a cooler evening ahead, consider closing out the day with a gentle walk along the waterfront, savoring the serene beauty that unfolds as the skyline reflects in the calm bay waters.",
