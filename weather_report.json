    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Denmark, the day has folded into a soft, damp hush. Earlier showers have faded to a memory, leaving pavements lacquered and the sky sealed with a uniform lid of cloud. There is no sunshine at this hour, and the UV index is effectively nil; the night feels muted and gentle, the air cool and clean, visibility decent but dulled by the low ceiling.\n\nCome morning, expect a grey start that keeps the sun at arm\u2019s length. Any brightness will likely be shy and short-lived, with the UV index staying low for the season and the cloud cover, perhaps nudging to modest levels only if the overcast thins around midday. It looks more contemplative than sparkling: comfortable enough if you dress for dampness. A light waterproof and layers will serve you well, with closed shoes and a compact umbrella to hand. At this hour, it\u2019s a good time to make tea, file a few thoughts, or prep tomorrow\u2019s breakfast; after daybreak, slip to a caf\u00e9 when it opens, browse a market under awnings, or visit a museum while the sky mulls things over. If the clouds grudgingly part later, take a short walk to enjoy the brief silver light.",
