The city appears subdued yet ethereal, shrouded in a gauzy light that softens the corners of buildings and reduces the usual clamor of the bustling streets into a muted backdrop. As the clock ticks toward the afternoon, temperatures will ease down to the mid-fifties, inviting you to wrap yourself in layers\u2014a light jacket or sweater will suffice against the crisp air stirred by a gentle breeze from the northwest.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the sky will transition to a partly cloudy canvas, with the chill of night settling to around 46 degrees. A stroll along the waterfront might be ideal as the clouds slowly part, revealing patches of the city washed in hesitant sunlight. Outdoor cafes beckon for a warm drink, allowing for quiet reflection as the day wanes. Light layering is recommended; think of a cozy scarf or a light hat to keep the chill at bay, while still embracing the moment's tranquility in this enchanting urban paradise.",
