    "weather_report": "Perth eases into late afternoon under a mostly clear sky, a few high scraps of cloud softening the sun without dimming it. The air feels clean and bright, visibility crisp, with the day still sunny but mellowing; the UV bite is slipping from moderate toward low as the light turns honeyed and shadows grow long. Expect a gentle, dry evening with the same scattered cloud and a calm, settled feel. It\u2019s pleasant weather to be out without fuss: light layers and sunglasses are enough now, with a cardigan ready for the cooler edge after dusk; a hat is optional, sunscreen only necessary if you\u2019re lingering in the sun before dinner. It\u2019s a good time for unhurried errands, a riverbank amble, watering the garden, or a quiet loop around the neighborhood on foot or bike, then a window cracked open at home to let in the soft air and the last of the day\u2019s warmth.",
