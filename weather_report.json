    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the air is crisp and clear, inviting an evening stroll through the city\u2019s vibrant streets. A gentle breeze from the north northeast dances between the buildings, carrying hints of winter to come. The temperature is set to dip to around 49, perfect for a light jacket or a cozy sweater as you navigate the lively downtown while the city lights flicker to life. The black canvas of the night is punctuated by the stars peeking through an otherwise stark skyline, offering a taste of the serene beauty that envelops the Bay area.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Sunday, expect a bright and sun-kissed day, with highs reaching close to 60. The early morning will likely remain devoid of that notorious San Francisco fog, setting the stage for a delightful weekend. Dress in layers, as the sun will rise to warm the day, but cool coastal breezes may invite a quick return to a warmer attire by afternoon\u2019s end. With such inviting weather, consider indulging in a leisurely breakfast at a local caf\u00e9, perhaps a brisk walk along the Embarcadero, or simply soaking in the sun at one of the many parks that dot the city. The allure of a clear sky beckons you to embrace the day, vibrant with possibility.",
