    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco wears a soft pewter light. Light showers have been brushing through and more are likely in pulses as the day ambles on, the rain gentle yet persistent enough to stipple pavements and hush the afternoon. Sunshine, if it appears, will be a brief, milky cameo; the UV index stays muted beneath the quilt of cloud, perhaps nudging moderate only in a fleeting bright break. The air feels freshly rinsed and calm, with visibility generally good though the edges of the day are a little smudged by drizzle.\n\nA light waterproof or compact umbrella suits the mood, with comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles and a breathable layer for the damp warmth between showers. It\u2019s a day for unhurried errands, a second coffee by a window, a tidy-up at home with the sash cracked for that rain-clean scent, or a short neighborhood loop when the sky lightens. Expect the gentle patter to linger into the later hours, so take the outdoor moments when you find them and let the rest be pleasantly indoorsy.",
