    "weather_report": "Adelaide eases into the morning under a soft pewter sky, the light a little washed and the air on the cool side. The sun feels shy and stays mostly backstage, with only brief, pale glimmers likely before midday. For now it\u2019s dry and calm enough for a gentle start.\n\nBy early afternoon, light rain is expected to wander through and linger into mid-afternoon, keeping the day muted rather than bright. UV looks modest for late winter, tempered further by cloud, though a brief midday break could still warrant sunglasses for the glare. Think layered comfort: a long-sleeve under a light waterproof, closed shoes, and a small umbrella for the pockets. It\u2019s a day for simple, easy errands this morning, then a slow coffee by a window, a gallery visit, or a tidy of the desk while rain beads the glass. If you fancy a walk, take it before lunch, and enjoy the hush before the showers arrive.",
