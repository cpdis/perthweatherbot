    "weather_report": "Perth settles under a polished, ink-blue sky tonight, the kind of clarity that makes the constellations feel close. The forecast keeps it simple: clear now, clear into the small hours, an uncomplicated night with good visibility and a clean horizon. The sun is asleep; UV is no concern until morning. If these cloudless skies hold, expect a bright, unfiltered start after dawn, so plan shade and sunscreen once the day wakes.\n\nDress lightly if you\u2019re stepping out, with a soft layer in case the breeze turns lean. It\u2019s a fine time for a quiet walk, to let the house breathe with the windows open, to water the garden without glare, or to unspool the day with some easy chores and a page or two on the balcony. The night promises steadiness rather than surprises; rest comes easier under a sky this clear.",
