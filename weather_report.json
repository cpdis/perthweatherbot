    "weather_report": "Perth lounges under a polished blue dome this late afternoon, the sun angling low and honeyed, with not a cloud to interrupt its clean light. The evening looks set to stay clear and calm, crisp with that unblinking visibility that makes edges look freshly cut. UV bite has softened from the midday blaze to something more forgiving, though the last rays can still kiss the skin a shade too warmly before they fade. Expect an easy slide into a cooler, lucid night.\n\nDress for comfort and change: airy layers and sunglasses for the next hour, a light sweater for after dark, and a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger outdoors. It\u2019s a good time for ordinary pleasures\u2014an unhurried walk home, watering the garden while the sky turns apricot, or reading by an open window as the heat drains from the day. If errands call, take the long way on foot; the evening is clear enough to make small tasks feel almost ceremonial.",
