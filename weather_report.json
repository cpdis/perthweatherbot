    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into evening with a clean, open sky and a quietly reflective mood. The forecast keeps it simple: clear to start, then a few clouds wandering in later, nothing to bother plans or blot the stars. Sunshine has taken its bow; UV is essentially nil until morning, so there\u2019s no need for shade or sunscreen now. It looks like an easy, pleasant night\u2014good visibility, gentle light, the kind that makes rooftops and trees look etched. A light layer or soft sweater will suit most people; add a jacket if you linger. This is a fine time for an unhurried stroll around the block, a short errand, a cup of tea on the balcony, or a quiet chat on the porch while the sky drifts from ink to charcoal.",
