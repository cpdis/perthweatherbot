    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the day with a calm clarity, the kind that offers a comforting embrace. The cool air hangs gently, around fifty-one degrees, while whispers of a light breeze drift in from the south. The sun's ascent promises a sunny spill of warmth, hovering near sixty-six degrees by midday, before settling into a softer palette of sixty-one in the afternoon. Those early risers venturing out will find the sky painted in serene blue, a clean canvas where light and shadows interlace.\n\nThe absence of fog reveals an open view, where the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the city's skyline stand proud, unmarred by the usual marine layer that often cloaks the bay. It\u2019s a splendid day to don layers\u2014 perhaps a light sweater or a comfortable jacket that can be shed as the sun climbs. One might find joy in a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a moment spent beneath the boughs of nearby trees in one of the city's parks. With the city at rest, now is the perfect time to savor a quiet morning coffee, allowing the gentle bustle of a waking city to warm the soul.",
