    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a heavy blanket of clouds envelops the city, merging with the soft whisper of impending rain. The atmosphere is thick with the promise of showers and thunderstorms, a far cry from the golden sunlit days the city often basks in. The temperature lingers just shy of 60, steadily declining, hinting at the chill that accompanies the moisture-laden air. A brisk wind sweeps in from the west-southwest, dancing through the streets with a playful yet assertive demeanor, pushing against anyone brave enough to traverse the cityscape.\n\nAs evening approaches, the rain is set to retreat, lured away by clearer skies, but tonight will still feel cool and damp, as temperatures rise slightly with the onset of night. It's a wonderful time to don a cozy sweater or wrap oneself in a light water-resistant coat, perhaps paired with comfortable shoes that can withstand the dampness underfoot. The evening's unpredictability suggests that a walk through the quieter streets could be a revelatory experience, where the fresh scent of rain mingles with the vibrant urban life still humming in the background. A gentle stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps finding solace in a well-loved caf\u00e9 may well provide the perfect retreat as the city transitions into night, cloaked in the soothing sounds of distant raindrops and the gentle lapping of waves.",
