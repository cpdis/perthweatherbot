The morning forecast shows those clouds lingering, which points to a day that is partly sunny rather than bright and blazing; expect soft light, good visibility, and a sky that occasionally opens to blue. UV should be modest for December, though the midday gleam can still catch you off guard\u2014sunglasses and a light dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go amiss. The air reads as seasonably mild, the kind of temperature that invites layers: a long-sleeve shirt or light sweater, with a thin jacket if you\u2019ll be out a while. It feels like a day for ordinary comforts\u2014finish a few errands, take a slow walk after lunch, tidy the garden beds, or claim a corner table by a caf\u00e9 window and let the shifting light do its unhurried work. Barring surprises, it looks quietly pleasant and unhurried rather than dramatic.",
