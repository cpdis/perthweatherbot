    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, a sense of calm lingers in the air, tempered with the promise of rain. The gentle drizzle predicted through the night drapes the city in a soft veil, delivering a muted charm that clings to the iconic architecture. With temperatures hovering around a cool 53, the evening beckons for light jackets or cozy sweaters, perfect companions to wander through the atmospheric streets or perhaps enjoy a warm drink in a caf\u00e9, where the sound of rain can be a comforting backdrop.\n\nAs we look ahead to Sunday, a steady rain is set to paint the canvas of the day, with high temperatures struggling to reach 61 before retreating in the afternoon. Expect to see the city shrouded in cloud cover, offering a dramatic, yet peaceful, tableau. Adequate layers and waterproof outerwear will be your allies if venturing outdoors, as the elements will surely call for a sense of preparedness. It\u2019s a day more suited for quiet reflection or indulging in indoor pursuits, perhaps a leisurely visit to one of San Francisco\u2019s many museums or galleries, where the subdued light can ignite inspiration amidst the patter of rain outside.",
