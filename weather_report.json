    "weather_report": "Perth leans into late afternoon under a spotless sky, the light turning honeyed and long. The day has been unblemished and bright, the kind that sharpens every edge and throws crisp shadows; UV would have bitten earlier, as spring begins to flex, but now it softens by the minute and settles toward gentle. Expect the evening to stay clear and serene, a clean blue sliding quietly to indigo after sunset, with visibility so true you can read the horizon.\n\nDress for ease: airy layers for the last warmth, sunglasses for the low glare, and a light jumper slipped over your shoulders once the sun drops. It\u2019s pleasant rather than fierce now, good for small errands on foot, airing the house, giving the balcony plants a drink, or finding a bench to sit with a paperback while the city exhales. As darkness gathers, an outdoor table suits an unhurried meal, and later the stars should arrive like precise pinpricks over a calm night.",
