    "weather_report": "Perth leans into the early afternoon with a bright, unwavering sun and a sky rinsed clear of cloud. Shadows are crisp, colors a little more saturated than usual, and the light has that summery insistence that warms the pavement and the patience. Expect the clarity to hold into late afternoon and early evening; it will stay sunny, with the UV likely very high now and only softening as the day slides toward dusk.\n\nDress light and breathable, a brimmed hat and sunglasses doing noble work, with sunscreen as quiet armor. Keep water close. It\u2019s a good day to take lunch in the shade, to hang a fresh load of washing and let the sun finish the job, to run a short errand on foot once the glare eases, or to tend balcony plants and watch their leaves brighten. Later, when the heat relaxes, a gentle amble along a tree-lined street or a quick ride to the corner shop will feel just right. Keep your plans unhurried; the sky has already done the heavy lifting.",
