    "weather_report": "As twilight gives way to night in the charming town of Subiaco, the sky continues to flaunt its arresting clarity. The earlier forecast of a clear sky was truly no exaggeration, with barely a wisp of a cloud marring the deepening cerulean as the stars begin to make their gleaming entrance. The sun, having been gratuitous in its offering of a pleasant warmth and favorable visibility throughout the day, has since taken its respectful bow and made way for the subtler, enchanting illumination of the moon. \n\nGranted, there's a gentle chill whispering through the streets now, as often happens when the night stretches forth and claims this time as its own. It would be wise, therefore, to don a light jacket if one had thoughts of ambling through the still, peaceful streets, soaking in the quiet serenity that often accompanies this hour. The lack of any UV threat means the night is open for unhurried strolls or simply bathing in the serendipitous charm of a clear, starlit sky. A tender celebration, perhaps, of the day well lived and the promise of the morrow just over the horizon.",
