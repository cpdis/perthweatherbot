    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Perth sits under a polished blue dome with not a cloud to trouble it. The sun still has a bright, insistent bite, though it\u2019s easing as it leans toward the horizon. UV has been fierce and remains assertive for now, tapering through the evening; the air is clean and the view sharp, with long, elegant shadows slipping across the streets.\n\nExpect the sky to stay crystal clear through sunset and into a calm, star-pricked night. Light, breathable clothes suit the hour; keep sunglasses and a hat close, refresh your sunscreen if you\u2019re still out, and carry water. It\u2019s good weather for a gentle errand run, a quiet stroll to the shops or along a shaded street, watering the garden, hanging the washing to catch the last golden rays, or an easy bike ride toward dusk; later, a simple dinner outdoors while the warmth ebbs.",
