    "weather_report": "As Subiaco settles into the tranquil embrace of evening, the skies hold a promise unbroken\u2014clear, expansive, unyielding in their azure clarity, even as darkness creeps closer. Earlier today, the sunlight flowed freely, casting its golden glow over the landscape without interruption. Now, despite the sun's retreat, the memory of its warmth lingers, cradling the town with a gentle reminder of the day's blissful simplicity. The air, having absorbed the heat of the day, remains pleasantly temperate, inviting one to linger outside longer than usual, perhaps taking a leisurely stroll or unwinding on a porch, drink in hand. \n\nThe day's unmarred clarity suggests that the UV index has been mercifully moderate, encouraging outdoor escapades without impunity. Evening wear should be light yet mindful of the cool that nests in shadows once the sun departs; a thin sweater perhaps, or a comfortable jacket to invite the dusk without regret. The absence of clouds plants a vivid stage for a starlit spectacle overhead, urging you to find a quiet spot beneath the sky's vast, twinkling canvas. Dine al fresco, relish in the simple act of watching the stars blink to life, or just sit planless, letting the evening air whisper quiet secrets of a day that was distinctly theirs.",
