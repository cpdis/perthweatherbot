    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a persistent drizzle blankets the morning, shrouding the city in a gray, muted light. The air feels cool and brisk, with temperatures that hover near a mild 62, giving way to a slight drop as the afternoon approaches. The winds gust gently from the south, wrapping the streets in whispers of movement, while the chance of precipitation lingers in the air, alive with droplets that promise to linger but remain light. Beyond the immediate urban sprawl, the characteristic fog plays its usual game of hide and seek, retreating slightly from the Golden Gate yet still looming nearby, offering glimpses of its elusive presence in the distance.\n\nAs the day meanders on, it is sensible to don layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a snug sweater, to fend off the chill as one navigates the drizzled sidewalks. This weather hints at a perfect day for a leisurely stroll through the winding streets, where the damp air invigorates, inviting visitors to explore hidden caf\u00e9s or perhaps find solace in a local bookstore, where the scent of old pages mingles with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Evenings allow for a quiet retreat, as the drizzle persists, perfect for curling up with a good book or enjoying a warm bowl of soup, while the city sighs in rhythm with the rain against the windows.",
