    "weather_report": "Perth leans into late afternoon with a sky mostly open and only a few stray clouds, the sun softening into a warm, honeyed glow. The day feels clear-eyed and calm, the breeze untying the heat and leaving the air easy to breathe. The sting of UV has eased to gentle levels now, though sunglasses still earn their keep as the light skims along roofs and trees.\n\nInto the evening, expect the same clean horizons and scattered cloud, slipping toward a cooler, settled night. A light layer will be enough now, with a cardigan or thin jacket ready once the sun drops. It\u2019s a good hour for ordinary pleasures: a short walk to shake out the day, a quick run to the shop, watering the pots on the verandah, or a quiet pedal before dusk. Windows open, dinner on the stove, and a moment by the window to watch the sky trade gold for blue.",
