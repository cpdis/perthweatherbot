    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a brilliant expanse of blue, as sunshine bathes the city. The air is alive with a crispness that hints at the coolness of evening ahead. With a high near 62, warmth prevails temporarily before temperatures gently dip to a comfortable 58, matched by a north wind whipping through at 20 mph, occasionally gusting to a formidable 38. The typical fog, a once-frequent companion in these coastal charms, seems to be taking a rare day off, allowing for breathtaking clarity over the Golden Gate and beyond.\n\nAs night approaches, expect the skies to remain clear, offering a serene canvas where stars may peep through by nightfall, creating a cozy ambiance. With temperatures settling around 47, rising slightly to 49, the cool breeze will beg for layers \u2014 a light jacket or a snug sweater will serve you well for the evening strolls along the waterfront or through the city\u2019s vibrant streets. Whether you choose to sip a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or meander through the quieter avenues, the day invites simple joys amidst a backdrop of unblemished skies.",
