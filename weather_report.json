    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries a heaviness that speaks of impending rain, cloaked in a thick, gray shroud. The sky looms low, casting a muted pallor over the landscape, as the temperature hovers at a cool 62 degrees, likely to dip as the afternoon progresses. A steady south wind whispers through the streets, rustling the leaves and sending an occasional gust racing past, hinting at the storm\u2019s arrival. The chance of precipitation sits comfortably at 70%, with the imminent drizzle signaling its readiness for a downpour that will surely embrace the city as night approaches.\n\nAs the evening draws near, the forecast guarantees a 100% chance of rain. The low of 57 will accompany this wet embrace, and the air will feel chillier with the wind\u2019s persistency. Fog envelopes the bay, creeping into the city with an ethereal touch, muffling sounds and blurring the outlines of familiar landmarks. In this context, the day bears an unpleasant edge, suggesting a retreat into cozy indoor spaces. Dressing in layers is wise; a warm sweater coupled with a water-resistant jacket will shield against both the chill and the rain. Consider finishing tasks indoors, perhaps enjoying an afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, wrapped in the warmth of a favorite book, or slipping into the inviting atmosphere of a bookstore where the barriers of weather can\u2019t touch the mind.",
