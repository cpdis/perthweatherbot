    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a cloak of cloudiness shrouds the city, hinting at the damp embrace of impending rain. The forecast speaks of drizzle giving way to a more resolute shower as night approaches, the air pregnant with the scent of moisture. In the dim glow of the streetlamps, the low temperature wraps around you like a light scarf, inviting the wise to don a long coat layered with a sweater for warmth. The gentle murmur of the east-northeast wind is at play, carrying with it the whisper of droplets soon to fall.\n\nCome morning, the landscape will remain forebodingly gray, the high barely reaching the low sixties before it turns cooler in the afternoon. The skies will persist in their overcast state, encouraging one to seek solace indoors or appreciate the city\u2019s charm through rain-slicked streets. A stroll along the waterfront might yield delightful reflections, but remember to embrace the cozy indoors\u2014a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 or an art exhibit would pair well with the atmosphere. In this weather, the persistent possibility of rain adds a layer of introspection to your day, beautifully underscored by the rhythmic patter of raindrops.",
