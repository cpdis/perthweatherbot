    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a lucid, blue-tinged sky, the sun already confident and the few clouds more decoration than threat. Through late morning the light will sharpen, with a scattering of puffs wandering in by afternoon, but the day stays bright and open, visibility crisp, colors a touch more saturated than usual. Expect the UV to bite around midday\u2014strong enough to warrant sunscreen, a brim, and good lenses\u2014yet the overall mood is cheerful and easy, the kind of fair weather that invites small errands to be done on foot.\n\nDress in light, breathable layers and keep shade in mind for the lunch hour. It\u2019s a pleasant day for ordinary pleasures: a stroll to the greengrocer, a coffee sipped beneath an awning, pages of a book turned in a patch of filtered light, or fresh laundry pegged to the line to drink the sun. If you\u2019re cycling to the shops, carry water and plan your loop before the sun gets fierce; the afternoon should remain agreeable, fleeced with benign cloud and full of clear edges.",
