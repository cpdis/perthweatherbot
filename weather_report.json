    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a clear, polished sky tonight, the sort of blue-black that sharpens every edge and hushes the streets. The sun is long gone and with it any bite of UV; visibility is crisp and the air feels uncomplicated, the kind of night that makes colors look truer under a porch light.\n\nThe forecast keeps the heavens empty through late evening and into the small hours, a pleasant, uncomplicated stretch ahead. Dress in light layers, a soft jacket if you linger outdoors, and enjoy the ease of it: a gentle lap around the block, watering the pots, windows cracked to draw in the cool, or a quiet chapter on the veranda while the neighborhood unwinds. If these bare skies greet dawn the same way, expect a bright start and a quick rise in UV once the sun is up; set out your sunglasses and a brim for morning errands so you can step straight into the day without thinking twice.",
