    "weather_report": "Perth leans into late afternoon under a lacquered blue, the horizon clean and the light unblinking. The sun still bites a little, the day bright and lucid, with shadows lengthening and edges crisp. It has been a high\u2011glare sort of afternoon; UV was fierce earlier and will stay assertive a while longer, then back down as the sun slides toward evening.\n\nExpect the rest of the day to stay cloudless and calm, the brightness softening to honeyed light before a clear night. It looks pleasantly uncomplicated: choose light, breathable layers, sunglasses, a hat, and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019re out before dusk, with water in hand. Good hours for modest errands and small comforts\u2014walk to the corner shop, give the balcony herbs a drink, hang a fresh load of washing, or take a gentle loop around the block once the glare eases.",
