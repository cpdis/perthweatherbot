    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Mascot leans gray-blue, the light thinned to a gentle sheen as cloud cover gathers and the day exhales. The sun is a shy companion now, filtered and brief, and the UV sting has eased to low. The air feels a touch damp, the edges of the skyline softened, with light rain expected to slip in after dusk and linger through the late evening. It\u2019s a calm, lightly soggy sort of mood, more whisper than drama.\n\nDress for a mild, damp evening: a light rain shell or compact umbrella, breathable layers, and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. If you\u2019ve errands, best to wrap them before the drizzle settles; otherwise, an unhurried neighborhood walk, a quiet train ride with a paperback, or a bit of unrushed cooking at home suits the tone. If you\u2019re heading out later, choose quick-dry fabrics and plan for a soft patter of rain rather than a downpour. The night looks subdued and companionable, with little sun and low UV, a good backdrop for small, steady plans.",
