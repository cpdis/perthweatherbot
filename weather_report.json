    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm envelops the city. The air is crisp and carries a whisper of warmth, promising a day that will invite exploration. This morning, the sky presents a patchwork of gently shifting clouds that hint at the dramatic encounters of the sun with the emerging remnants of the night. The forecast speaks of a fleeting chance of drizzle at dawn but reassures that the sun will grace the city soon, lifting spirits and illuminating the streets with soft golden light.\n\nAs day breaks, expect a tranquil embrace, with temperatures gradually climbing, eventually settling into a cool yet comfortable rhythm. While the South wind carries a gentle breath from the bay, the horizon remains mostly clear, though wispy strands of fog linger in the distance, teasing the edges of the Golden Gate and softening the outline of the Marin Headlands. This makes for a visually compelling morning for those who venture on foot, ideally dressed in layered clothing\u2014light yet warm enough to fend off the chill sweeping in from the water. A stroll through the historic neighborhoods or a peaceful sit in one of the city\u2019s many parks feels particularly inviting today. The balance of the day is perfect for savoring a leisurely brunch at a local caf\u00e9, where you can watch the rhythm of the city awaken around you, or perhaps a walk along the waterfront, as the fog dances lightly in and out of view.",
