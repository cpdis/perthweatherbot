    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon breathes with a gentle warmth beneath a broad, sunlit sky. The day has unfolded into a delightful tapestry of golden hues and clear horizons, allowing views of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge unmarred by the usual fog. The air is crisp yet inviting, with a light breeze that rustles through the streets, beckoning passersby to indulge in the fresh outdoor atmosphere. As we approach the evening, the city will don a cloak of partly cloudy skies, with lingering temperatures settling into the cool embrace of the low forties.\n\nFor those pondering their attire, light layers will suit this transitional day perfectly; a cozy sweater over a simple shirt is ideal, shielding against the cooling air while remaining comfortable under the sun\u2019s gaze. As the sun descends, a light jacket or scarf will add just the right touch of warmth for those strolling along the waterfront or enjoying a late afternoon coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9. A walk through the neighborhoods, perhaps a visit to the expansive parks or quiet corners of the city, promises an invigorating experience amid the lingering sunlight and serene conditions, making this a perfect moment to savor the simple joys the city has to offer.",
