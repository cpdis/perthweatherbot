    "weather_report": "The morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco under a layer of soft clouds, with the sun attempting to break through the veil, a gentle precursor to the day\u2019s shift. The high is expected to linger near a brisk 55 degrees, giving way to a cooler afternoon as the temperatures drift downward to about 52. Today feels quintessentially San Franciscan, with a light east-northeast breeze whispering through the streets, carrying both the promise of clarity and the inevitable embrace of developing clouds.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect rain to grace the city after dinner, a return of the familiar calming patter, with the skies deepening to a gray mass overhead. With a 90% chance of precipitation, the air will grow heavier with moisture, pushing temperatures to a cozy 47 degrees tonight. Layer up with a warm jacket and perhaps a scarf, as the evening may feel damp and chilly. It\u2019s the perfect time to seek refuge in a local caf\u00e9 or explore the inviting charm of an independent bookstore, allowing the day\u2019s activities to shift from outdoor pursuits to cozy indoor pastimes.",
