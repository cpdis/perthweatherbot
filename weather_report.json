    "weather_report": "As daylight breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a tapestry of clouds hangs overhead, casting a soft gray hue across the city. The weather whispers of rain, with expectations of moisture lingering until the afternoon. The air carries a chill, measuring around 60 degrees, and with a gusty southwest wind, it might feel even cooler. As you step outside, the anticipation of rain still clings to the atmosphere, while a hint of sun breaks through, promising a fleeting warmth before the clouds settle back in.\n\nFog drapes the hills like a delicate shawl, particularly near the Golden Gate, creating a dreamy backdrop that perfectly complements the city\u2019s iconic landscapes. Visibility wavers among the mist, giving way to sporadic bursts of clarity that reveal the unmistakable silhouette of the skyline. Dressing in layers is prudent today; a light jacket paired with a sweater will serve you well against the brisk winds. Despite the inclement weather, delightful moments await\u2014perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 visit, where the warmth of a steaming cup of coffee awaits, or a quiet stroll near the waterfront, where the rhythmic lap of the waves offers a soothing antidote to the bustling day. Look out for those unexpected breaks of sunlight; they may just bless your afternoon with a beautiful reprieve.",
