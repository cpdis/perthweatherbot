    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco arrives under a quilt of scattered cloud, the sun a softened coin slipping toward the rooftops. The air feels clear but cooling, with a faint dampness gathering; expect light showers to wander in after dusk. Not a bright, dazzling day\u2014more a muted one\u2014so glare is subdued and the UV is gentle now, easing away with the light. It\u2019s the sort of weather that rewards light layers and a pocketable umbrella, comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind a sprinkle. If you\u2019re out, finish the last errands on foot, return that library book, or fetch a loaf for supper; if you\u2019re home, crack a window for the fresh, clean scent before the rain arrives and lay out something simple for the evening.",
