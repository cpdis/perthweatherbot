    "weather_report": "Adelaide moves through a silvery midday, the sun slipping in and out of scattered cloud so the streets brighten, dim, then brighten again. It\u2019s not a sharp, blue day, more a softly lit one with decent clarity and a low, winter-mild UV bite; sunglasses won\u2019t be wasted, but the sun won\u2019t scold. The air feels agreeable rather than bracing, the kind that makes a walk to lunch feel unhurried and kind.\n\nAs the afternoon wears on, the ceiling lowers and the mood turns damp, with light rain likely toward evening. Dress in easy layers and keep a light rain shell or compact umbrella within reach; closed shoes will make puddles an afterthought. Best to run errands or take a short park loop early, then reward yourself with a quiet caf\u00e9 stool, a gallery browse, or a tidy-up of the desk by a window while the showers patter in. If you stay out, a hat and a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t hurt while the sun peeks through, then trade them for a hood as the day softens to drizzle.",
