    "weather_report": "Perth slides into early afternoon under a friendly quilt of scattered clouds, the sun slipping between them to throw bright, clean light across the streets. Expect this patchwork sky to hold through the later hours, keeping the day largely sunny with moments of soft shade; visibility should stay crisp and colors true. UV will still bite through the early afternoon, then ease toward late day, so a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen remain wise. The air feels clear rather than heavy, the sort of day where shadows are sharp and the mood is unhurried.\n\nDress in light, breathable layers and comfortable shoes for wandering. This is good weather for a quiet lap along the river path, a coffee taken outside beneath an awning, or a small round of errands on foot while the sun is generous but not punishing. If you\u2019ve got plants, give them a check and a drink before the afternoon deepens; as the light mellows, sit on a balcony or back step with a book and let the sky do its gradual work.",
