    "weather_report": "As the twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle chill settles in, hinting at the crisp night ahead. Beneath a canopy of partly cloudy skies, the temperature gracefully dips towards the low end of comfort, reaching for that serene low of 42. A soft breeze whispers through the streets, providing just enough of a push to remind you that warmth is not far from your grasp. Looking to tomorrow, the promise of a mostly sunny day beckons; however, clouds may dance with the potential of a rainy afternoon, creating a delicate balance between sunlight and the sporadic drop of rain that could arrive post 4 PM. \n\nThe outlook evokes a sense of quiet contemplation, urging you to don layers\u2014a light sweater beneath a spring jacket, perhaps, to navigate the shifting temperatures from midday\u2019s embrace of 54 to the evening cool. Mornings may be spent wandering through Golden Gate Park, where the serene quietude melds with the soft rustle of leaves. As the day unfolds, an afternoon coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9 downtown could serve as the perfect refuge while waiting for the rain to grace the pavement. Should the sun manage to assert its dominance, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero could present an invigorating option before clouds roll in. The sights of the Bay, now tranquil under a potentially fleeting sun, offer their own quiet charm amidst the shifting veil of weather.",
