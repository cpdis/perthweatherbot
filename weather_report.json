    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night gracefully surrenders to a clear dawn, with the temperature settling comfortably around 45 degrees, gently nudging upward as the hours pass. The air is crisp, serenaded by a light northeast breeze whispering through the streets. As the city awakens, the forecast hints at a day cloaked in mostly sunny skies, reaching a high near 59 before yielding to a soft descent into early evening. The clarity from Sutro Tower, looking across toward the Golden Gate and the bustling downtown, likely reveals a backdrop of blue, unmarred by fog or haze, a comforting certainty seldom felt in other seasons.\n\nAs you don your layers, consider a light sweater for the morning chill, complemented perhaps by a light jacket for those moments spent outside, capturing that fleeting warmth as the sun climbs higher. With the pleasant weather beckoning, a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park could be just the remedy one seeks\u2014a quiet walk past tranquil gardens or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. Today's offerings are simple yet rewarding, perfect for savoring the tranquility that only a crisp San Francisco day can provide.",
