    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a cloudless late evening, the sky clear as glass and quietly expansive. With the sun long gone, UV has slipped to near zero and the night looks clean and steady, the kind that carries sound down the street. The forecast keeps it clear through midnight and beyond, giving the hours a gentle, unhurried feel and making the air easy to be in.\n\nExpect a bright, untroubled start after sunrise if this clarity holds, with UV climbing quickly through the morning; plan shade and sunscreen once the day is underway. For now, it\u2019s pleasant and simple: a light layer or cardigan will suit a late errand, a short walk to unwind, or a few minutes on the verandah to let the house breathe. Water the pots, set out the recycling, tidy the bike for tomorrow\u2019s ride, and let the night do its quiet work.",
