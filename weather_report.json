    "weather_report": "Late-day light in Dallas feels warm and forgiving, the sky mostly open with only a few lazy clouds drifting by. The morning outlook promised clarity and it seems to have delivered, leaving the afternoon bright and clean-edged. Sun is still doing gentle work now, but the UV is weak this late in the day; earlier it would have run modest under the clear canopy. Air feels dry and uncomplicated, the sort that sharpens colors and makes distant buildings look newly drawn.\n\nDress in easy layers: keep the sunglasses for the last stretch of sun, and carry a light sweater or jacket for the cool that slips in toward dusk. It\u2019s a good time for unhurried errands, a quick neighborhood loop, or a quiet perch by a window with a late coffee and a few pages of reading. If there\u2019s a small task you\u2019ve been meaning to finish\u2014watering a plant, straightening the entryway\u2014this clear, calm afternoon invites it, without hurry or fuss.",
