As the last vestiges of drizzle attempt to linger before giving way to brighter patches, there\u2019s a promise of a clearer afternoon on this Veterans Day. Yet, as the wind sweeps in from the west, it nudges the leaves with a brisk, playful bite, a reminder that the warmth of sunny days is still an elusive dance in this coastal town. \n\nWhile a tentative sun may peek through in the latter part of the day, the air remains cool and crisp, urging layers for warmth\u2014a light jacket would serve well, perhaps knit gloves for those who can\u2019t resist a stroll. The seas shimmer with a restless energy, touched by the ghost of a marine layer that flees as the sun\u2019s rays begin to break through. For those inclined to venture outdoors, a gentle walk through the park or a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s offers refuge from the chill\u2014perfect for sipping something warm while watching the world adjust to the transforming skies.",
