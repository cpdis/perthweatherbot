The forecast anticipates rain later in the afternoon, which might veil the city in a soft blur as clouds gather with the promise of precipitation. Until then, patches of sun feebly compete with the encroaching clouds, casting a delicate light on the iconic skyline. Expect temperatures to glide from a lofty 62 down to a chillier 60, coaxed by a southwest breeze that whispers tales of the sea. \n\nTonight will bring the rain, likely wrapping the city in a comforting embrace of drizzles and mist as the temperatures descend toward a cozy 53 degrees. In this arena of shifting cloud formations, the marine layer lurks discreetly, ready to blanket the Golden Gate with its ethereal touch. For those venturing outdoors, layers will prove benevolent\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a sweater, fortified against the rising winds. A stroll along the Embarcadero seems fitting; the sultry scents of the bay mingling with the promise of rain could invoke a reflective mood, perfect for a caf\u00e9 stop or simply watching the world drift by as autumn unfolds.",
