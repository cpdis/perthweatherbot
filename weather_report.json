    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky feels close and heavy, the kind of damp hush that softens streetlight halos and makes the roads whisper. Light showers shuffle through now, with steadier rain likely toward dawn, so the night is more charcoal than moonlit. Sunshine is offstage for the moment; the UV is negligible until well after sunrise, and even then the first act looks muted by cloud, clarity more smudged than sharp. It\u2019s not unpleasant so much as contemplative, a quiet, rain-polished mood.\n\nExpect a grey, slow-blooming morning with rain about, then a chance of gentler breaks later if the cloud loosens. Dress in easy layers and a light waterproof, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and tuck a compact umbrella by the door. If you\u2019re up late, let the weather grant permission to wind down with a book or lay out tomorrow\u2019s kit; at first light, dawdle over a warm coffee, run an errand between showers, or duck into the library or a small gallery. If the rain eases, a brief stroll under awnings or a visit to a plant nursery would suit the day\u2019s tempered light.",
