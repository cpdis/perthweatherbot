    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Flinders Park, the air feels hushed and cool, the sky a heavy lid of cloud that flattens the streetlights and dulls the horizon. Rain gathers itself for daybreak, arriving with some intent around sunrise and easing to a gentler patter by midmorning. Sunshine will be scarce; any bright moments will be brief and watery. Expect a muted, soft-edged morning with glistening roads and blurred reflections. The UV index sits low in these conditions and should remain low through the morning, only inching up if the cloud thins later.\n\nDress for damp and chill: a light waterproof or trench with a hood, comfortable shoes that won\u2019t slip, and a layer you can peel off if the air turns milder after the rain eases. It\u2019s a day for unhurried errands and simple comforts\u2014brew coffee before the commute, leave a few minutes early for slick streets, drop by the shops between showers, or tend to small indoor tasks that have been waiting their turn. If you\u2019re walking, keep an umbrella handy and let the rain set the tempo.",
