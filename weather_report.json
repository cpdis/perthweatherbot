    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips past midnight under a soft, wet hush, light rain tufting the eaves and turning the streets to ink and silver. Clouds have the night sewn shut, so there\u2019s no moonlight to speak of and the UV is asleep; visibility is gentle, edges blurred, the town lit like a quiet stage between scenes.\n\nThrough the small hours and into dawn, passing showers linger, likely yielding a muted sunrise with only thin, hesitant light at first. Sunshine looks limited early; if the cloud deck fractures later, brightness will return in brief, clean intervals, and the UV will climb quickly once it does. It\u2019s a day for comfort rather than sparkle: dress in light layers with a rain shell, sturdy shoes, and a pocket umbrella; after sun-up, keep sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen handy in case the sky opens. Let the weather set a humane pace\u2014an early tram ride with a book, a calm coffee under a verandah while the pavements dry in patches, or a gentle start at the desk clearing yesterday\u2019s loose ends. If you\u2019re cycling before breakfast, lights on and a fender help; if you\u2019re driving, leave a few extra beats for the slick, reflective roads.",
