    "weather_report": "As daylight breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the chill of early morning embraces the city, with a muted palette of grays and soft pinks gracing the sky. A delicate marine layer blankets the horizon, hinting at the day to come. While today\u2019s forecast murmurs of rain, the clouds seem hesitant to break, maintaining an almost imperceptible veil over familiar landmarks. As the hours drift toward afternoon, the sun will contend briefly with scattered clouds, but not without the promise of rain slipping in quietly by late afternoon. \n\nWith temperatures hovering near the low fifties, it\u2019s sensible to bundle up in layers \u2014 a light jacket over a cozy sweater will suit the day\u2019s evolving nature. Perhaps take a leisurely stroll through the meandering streets or enjoy a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9, allowing the city\u2019s pulse to invigorate your spirit. The chance of rain lingers in the air, suggesting later hours might be perfect for curling up with a good book, listening to the gentle patter against the window, a fitting backdrop to a day that hints at the comfort of home amid the cool embrace of a San Francisco winter.",
