    "weather_report": "In Subiaco, the day dances with the gentle sound of rain, having carried its melody into the afternoon, now lingering in the cooling echo of twilight. The clouds, having performed their drizzly ballet earlier, cloak the sky in thick layers, rendering it a muted canvas of grays and blues. The light, filtered through this soft haze, rarely touches the earth with its warmth\u2014a day less about brightness and more about the deep, comforting embrace of overcast skies. The sun takes its shy leave behind the curtain of drizzle, rendering any concern for UV exposure moot. There's a certain romanticism to the rain-touched air, encouraging a sense of introspection rather than outdoor adventures.\n\nStrategically layered clothing will serve as both armor and ally today, with a light raincoat adding both flair and utility\u2014a statement piece against the drizzle\u2019s embrace, yet breathable enough should the storm's muse decide to rest. For activities, embrace the weather's intimate invitation to cozy pursuits. Seek the warmth of a nearby caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly ground coffee mingles with whispered conversations, or take refuge in the quiet sanctuary of a library, pages offering their own kind of sunlight. The outdoor world, damp and soft at dusk, calls less to roving feet and more to hearts eager to pause, reflect, and listen to the gentle symphony that only rain can compose.",
