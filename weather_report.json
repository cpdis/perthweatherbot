    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Perth arrives clear and honeyed, the sun slipping lower yet still bright enough to cast crisp shadows; the UV sting is easing now, settling to moderate and falling toward low by dusk. The air feels clean, the sky mostly unmarred for the next hour, then a gentle change approaches with light evening showers that will soften the view and hush the streets. It\u2019s a pleasant, unhurried spell: warm without weight, a good moment for small errands or a quiet stroll. Wear breathable layers and sunglasses for the last of the glare, and tuck a light jacket or compact umbrella in your bag for later. Consider a walk to pick up something for supper, a window seat with a book, or hanging the washing for a quick dry and bringing it in before the sprinkle arrives, when pavements will darken and the night take on a reflective sheen.",
