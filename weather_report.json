    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a palpable heaviness in the air, dark clouds cloaking the skyline. Rain is imminent, saturating the atmosphere with the promise of downpours that will intensify before noon. Outside, the wind roars from the southwest, a turbulent companion to the pervasive gloom, reminding you of nature\u2019s wildness. As the temperature hovers in the mid-fifties, it is a day that demands warm layers; a sturdy rain jacket accompanied by a cozy sweater underneath will shield against the chill and moisture.\n\nThe day promises little reprieve from the weather\u2019s capriciousness. Thunderstorms might join the rain, casting a tempestuous spell over the city, while the evening transitions to lighter showers. Tonight, expect the low to linger around fifty, offering only a mild rise in warmth as the hours add weight. Despite this gray ambiance, there is still space for exploration; a stroll beneath an umbrella through the city\u2019s storied streets might yield unexpected charm, perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warming drink while watching the city navigate its rain-kissed reverie.",
