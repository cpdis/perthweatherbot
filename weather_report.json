    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night air is crisp and clear, adorned only by the faint breath of a gentle wind from the north northeast. As the city transitions into a lovely Wednesday, the sun promises to rise with an optimistic glimmer. Expect a high near sixty-one, but be aware, as the afternoon approaches, the temperature will retreat to around fifty-seven. This gentle dance of warmth is painted against a backdrop of soft blue skies devoid of fog's typical embrace; for now, the marine layer appears to have withdrawn, allowing the city's familiar architecture to breathe in the open light.\n\nThe day's pleasantness allows for simple pleasures outdoors. A light jacket will suffice for the cooler moments, especially in shaded areas or if you find yourself near the bay. With these agreeable conditions, a stroll through the city's winding streets could reveal cozy cafes offering warm drinks, perfect for indulging in a quiet moment with a book. Or perhaps, a leisurely visit to the parks beckons\u2014a chance to soak in the serene views without the fog's interruptions. Today carries the promise of tranquility and clarity, inviting a subtle exploration of both familiar and hidden treasures in this enchanting city.",
