    "weather_report": "With the clock gently chiming past two in the morning, Subiaco's night whispers with the soft patter of light rain that has enveloped the town since dusk. The sky remains an enigmatic tapestry of grey, with the misty drizzle kissing the empty streets, creating a hushed symphony that lulls the weary world to sleep. As dawn slowly approaches, the promise of a sunlit day hangs in the balance, shadowed by an overcast promise of more showers. The sunlight plays a game of hide and seek behind the thick clouds, leaving the UV warnings muted and the day's clarity tinged with a silver hue.\n\nFor those venturing out, a comforting layer or two would be wise\u2014a raincoat perhaps, to ward off the gentle dampness that persists like an echo. The air, though fresh, carries a cool embrace that invites introspection or perhaps a leisurely walk beneath the canopy of trees orchestrating their own rain-dance. It's the kind of day to cradle a steaming cup of coffee while nestled in a cozy corner with a good book, or to take a slow, reflective stroll through the dewy lanes, letting the rhythm of rain inspire quiet thoughts. It's a Sunday wrapped in a soft, grey blanket, whispering a leisurely cadence that's hard to rush against.",
