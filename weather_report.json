    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into night under a patchwork of cloud, the sky dim and a little secretive. Broken cloud is expected to thicken toward late evening, with a light, passing rain after midnight. Sunshine is no longer a concern; the UV is effectively nil now, and any early light at dawn will probably feel softened by leftover cloud and damp air. The night looks gently unsettled rather than harsh\u2014quiet streets, a faint sheen on the pavement, and the occasional whisper of drizzle.\n\nDress for calm and convenience: a light layer, something with a hood or a small umbrella in your bag if you\u2019ll be out late, and shoes that don\u2019t mind a wet footpath. It\u2019s good weather for a short, unhurried walk before the first drops arrive, for taking the bins out, setting out tomorrow\u2019s clothes, or letting a kettle come to the boil while you answer one last message and listen to the rain find its rhythm.",
