    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a shroud of clouds envelops the city, casting a muted light across its iconic skyline. The rain is not just a possibility; it has begun to weave itself into the fabric of the day, creating a backdrop that feels both introspective and slightly melancholic. The high temperature wrestles with the chill of the season, settling around 58 degrees and gradually yielding to cooler afternoons. Winds from the southeast whip through the streets, bringing with them both a brisk freshness and the promise of more rain, which, later tonight, will intensify, turning into a steady downpour with substantial accumulation expected. \n\nVisibility may be compromised as the fog mingles with a low marine layer, softly blurring the edges of the Golden Gate, reminding us of the city's propensity to dance with the elements. Dressing appropriately becomes essential; a warm, waterproof layer, perhaps accompanied by a cozy scarf, would serve you well. Today is a perfect day for quieter pleasures\u2014an invitation to linger in a caf\u00e9 with a good book or to explore local galleries, sampling the art that reflects the soul of this vibrant metropolis. As night approaches, the rhythmic sound of rain will set the perfect scene for comfort, urging you to embrace the cozy indoors rather than wander the dampened streets.",
