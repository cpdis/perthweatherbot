    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a serene clarity, as gentle sunshine bathes the streets. The high hovering around a comfortable 65 degrees carries a pleasant warmth, contrasting sweetly with the coolness of the air. Winds whisper softly from the west, creating a light breeze that flutters leaves and stirs the minds of those wandering outdoors. As the temperatures are set to ease into the late afternoon, expect a gradual descent to the mid-fifties, inviting you to savor the moment before evening draws its curtain.\n\nTonight will embrace the city in a patchwork of warmth and cool breezes, presenting a lovely opportunity for evening strolls under mostly clear skies. The low will settle comfortably at around 46 degrees, allowing for a cozy embrace of layers. Unfortunately, the infamous fog, so characteristic of this coastal region, seems to have held off for now, allowing for expansive views throughout the day. This clear weather encourages a spontaneous excursion to the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9 sipping something warm. Consider dressing in breathable layers with a light jacket, perfect for the delightful transition as daylight gives way to dusk.",
