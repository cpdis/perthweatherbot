With a whisper of a south wind, the air feels crisp and cool, dipping to around 48 degrees\u2014a subtle reminder of the city's embrace of autumn's chill. While these serene conditions make for a peaceful evening stroll, tomorrow's forecast heralds a different scenario, one where the tranquility of tonight gives way to the promise of rain.\n\nAs dawn approaches, expect a tapestry of clouds to weave across the sky, thickening as the day unfolds. Rain will arrive after 10 a.m., gently interspersing itself with the city's famous fog\u2014a near certainty, as the chance of precipitation stands at 80%. The temperatures will hover around the mid-50s, lending an air that hints at comfort wrapped in a cozy layer. It is advisable to don a light jacket, perhaps a waterproof layer if venturing outside, as the afternoon rain could usher in a chill that lingers in the air. The marine layer, typical for this time of year, may blanket the outer edges, softening visibility, but also capturing the city\u2019s shimmering lights\u2014a scene best enjoyed through the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9 window as the rain dances against the glass. \n\nWith the promise of rain on the horizon, consider indulging in less strenuous delights. A warm cup of coffee or tea at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, perhaps followed by a wander through the local shops, could serve as the perfect antidote to the burgeoning gray\u2014a day to savor the simple pleasures the city has to offer.",
