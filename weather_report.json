There\u2019s a serenity in this moment, reminiscent of the long shadows cast by day\u2019s end.\n\nHowever, the forecast for tomorrow brings with it a shifting mood. Expect rain to roll in after the sun rises, bathing the city in a curtain of soft, drumming precipitation. The clouds will thicken, robbing the afternoon of the sun\u2019s warmth, with temperatures creeping back down to a brisk 56 degrees. A chance of light rain bathe the streets in shimmering reflections, while the air retains a dampness that could herald a robust marine layer, particularly along the bay. For a day like this, layered attire will be your best companion\u2014consider a light rain jacket over your everyday sweater, and don\u2019t forget an umbrella for those unexpected drizzles. \n\nOn such a misty day, there\u2019s a charm to the caf\u00e9 lined streets, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafts invitingly. A stroll through the rainy sidewalks might lead you to explore the local bookstores or indulge in a quiet afternoon of reflection in one of the city\u2019s welcoming art galleries. Alternatively, finding a cozy nook to sip warm beverages while watching the world outside transform under the rain could bring a contemplative sweetness to your Sunday.",
