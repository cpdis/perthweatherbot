    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into night with only a few small clouds idling overhead, the sort that leave the stars room to breathe and the streets a calm, silvery hush. The air feels uncomplicated and clear; the sun has long since slipped away, so UV is effectively nil until morning. If this gentle pattern holds, the first light should arrive to a mostly open sky, bright and clean, with UV rising quickly as the day gathers pace in midsummer.\n\nFor now it\u2019s a pleasant, low\u2011key evening. A light layer or soft cardigan will suit an amble around the block or a few quiet minutes on the balcony. Windows can be cracked to let in the mild air while you finish a chapter, water the herbs, or take the dog for an unhurried loop under the streetlamps. If you\u2019ll be out after sunrise, plan for brightness: sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen will serve you well once the day wakes up fully.",
