    "weather_report": "Katy settles into evening under a swept-clean sky, clear now and expected to stay that way through the late hours. The air reads calm and uncomplicated, with stars sharpening as the night deepens. With the sun down, there\u2019s no sting from ultraviolet; the UV index is effectively nil, and the night carries that crisp, glassy clarity that makes distances feel closer and colors softer.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant, low-drama night\u2014cool enough for a light jacket or a favorite sweater, comfortable shoes for an easy loop around the block, or a few quiet minutes on the porch with a warm mug. Good weather for walking the dog, unhurried tidying in the garage, or fitting in a simple errand without the day\u2019s bustle. If you\u2019re up near first light, this clear stretch may grant a bright, gentle sunrise; sunglasses could be handy after dawn, but for now the calm, starry dark is the show.",
