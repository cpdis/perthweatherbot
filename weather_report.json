    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a cool, quiet spring midnight with a few clouds adrift and the faint scent of damp on the air. Skies are mostly clear for now, though a light, passing shower is likely to brush through before dawn, softening the edges of the night. Clarity is decent beneath the streetlamps, with stars fading as cloud thickens toward morning. The UV index is negligible at this hour and will stay tame until the sun lifts.\n\nThrough the day, expect a gentle, changeable rhythm: a brief, early rinse, then brighter breaks as cloud thins and the light grows more confident. Sunshine should feel filtered rather than fierce, with the UV index low at first and edging into moderate territory by late morning if the sun wins out. Dress in easy layers you can shrug on and off, add a light rain shell or small umbrella, and choose comfortable shoes that won\u2019t mind a damp pavement. Just now is a fine time to brew tea, read a few pages, or take a short, unhurried stroll between drops; later, run a couple of errands, linger over coffee in a sheltered courtyard, or tend to small tasks by a window as the day clears.",
