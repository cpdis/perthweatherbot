    "weather_report": "As night embraces Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is draped in a shroud of clouds, wrapping the city in a cool embrace. Temperatures hover around a crisp 49 degrees, where a gentler south wind stirs lazily, barely making its presence felt. The hint of drizzle lingers in the air, a brief whisper expected in the early hours. The horizon, while dimly lit by the city\u2019s glow, suggests a morning with perhaps some cuts of sunlight daring to break through by mid-afternoon\u2014offering a high of 60 before retreating to a cooler 56. \n\nGiven the anticipated weather, dressing in layers would serve one well, combining a light jacket with breathable attire to navigate the day's possible drizzle and yawning chill. An early stroll along the Embarcadero could be refreshing, the gentle sound of the waves harmonizing with the city\u2019s persistent pulse. As the sun creeps higher, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink might perfectly complement the quieter hours, allowing for reflection and a touch of warmth amidst the lingering chill. The whispers of the marine layer might still caress the hills, but as afternoon unfurls, the city reveals more of its vibrant self, ready to be explored in its unique, moody charm.",
