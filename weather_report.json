    "weather_report": "Bayswater woke to high, thinned cloud and then a light rinse of rain mid-morning; now, at midday, the air feels freshly washed and a little cool around the edges. Expect a changeable afternoon with passing showers and brief, silvery breaks of sun. When the sun does appear it will have a gentle bite to it for a short while, so the UV sits low to moderate at most; otherwise it\u2019s a softly lit day, clarity muted by veils of cloud and damp streets that give everything a quiet sheen.\n\nDress for variety: light layers, something with a hood or a compact umbrella, and shoes that don\u2019t mind a puddle. It\u2019s a day for nearby comforts\u2014an unhurried coffee by a window, a meander to the greengrocer between showers, or a short loop through the nearest park when the sky brightens for a spell. If you\u2019re staying in, crack a window and let the cool, clean smell of rain drift through while you tend to small tasks.",
