    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a clear, velvety night, the kind that makes streetlights feel far away and the air a touch cooler on the skin. Visibility is crisp and unobstructed; the world looks freshly sketched. UV is effectively nil now, and the mood is gentle rather than bracing. Expect the sky to stay cloudless as the evening drifts into the small hours.\n\nWith skies this clean, daylight tends to arrive sharp and unapologetic, so when the sun returns it will feel frankly sunny and the UV will ramp up quickly toward late morning. Dress the evening with light layers or a soft cardigan; by day, think breathable fabrics, a hat, sunglasses, and a lick of sunscreen. Tonight suits a quiet neighbourhood amble, rinsing the heat from the day, or a simple hour on the balcony with a book. If you\u2019re up early, water the garden while the shadows are long, or take a quick coffee walk before the sun flexes.",
