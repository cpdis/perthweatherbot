    "weather_report": "Perth drifts into late afternoon under a soft, paling sky. Clouds gather and thicken, with a light shower likely around the dinner hour before easing to broken cloud through the evening. Sunshine will be fleeting at best, brief silvery glints between gaps, and the UV is low now and fading with the sinking sun. The air feels mild and a touch damp; clarity is more watercolor than high-definition, streets darkening and distance smudged.\n\nDress for changeability: a light layer and a thin, shower-proof jacket, breathable fabrics, and shoes you don\u2019t mind meeting wet pavement. Sunglasses are optional, useful only for those short bright breaks. It\u2019s a night for easy, unrushed errands\u2014duck to the shops between sprinkles, take a short walk along a sheltered street to watch the first lamps bloom, or settle by a cafe window and let the rain bead and slide as you finish the day. If you\u2019re homebound, crack a window to the cool air and let the evening\u2019s hush take over.",
