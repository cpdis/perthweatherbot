    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts into night with a clear, settled sky and a calmness that feels unhurried; by late evening it opens wide and clean, then toward the small hours a few harmless clouds may wander through. There\u2019s no sun to speak of now and the UV has faded to nothing, leaving the air crisp and honest, the horizon edges sharp and the stars likely to stand out like small, steady lamps. It\u2019s pleasant rather than cold, the sort of evening that rewards a light layer\u2014an easy cardigan or long sleeves\u2014and comfortable shoes if you\u2019re stepping out. A short stroll after dinner, a quiet sit on the veranda, or a gentle errand around the block would suit the mood; windows can be nudged open for a touch of night air and a clear head. Expect the clarity to linger overnight; sleep will carry the promise of a simple, bright start when the sun returns.",
