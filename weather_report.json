    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the morning has unveiled itself with a bright sun casting a gentle warmth over the city. The temperature will rise near a gentle 67 degrees, gradually falling as afternoon approaches, while a light breeze sweeps in from the west-northwest, offering a refreshing touch. Clouds drift lazily across the sky, though they remain sparse, allowing for clarity that invites exploration and enjoyment of the urban landscape.\n\nAs evening unfolds, a mostly clear night will settle in, with a chill creeping down to about 56 degrees. The northwest winds will pick up, with gusts that could rustle the leaves and send a shiver through the air. Dress comfortably in layers to embrace the daytime warmth and prepare for the evening coolness. It's an ideal day for a leisurely stroll through the vibrant neighborhoods or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where you can enjoy the city's unique energy while sheltering from the brisk winds later in the day. Whatever your choice, let the gentle sunshine and clear skies guide your way.",
