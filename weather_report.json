    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a shroud of cloudiness, heralding the arrival of rain shortly after nightfall. With a chill hovering around 50 degrees, and the promise of temperatures creeping minimally upwards through the night, the atmosphere feels damp and heavy, infused with the scent of moisture that precedes a storm. Southerly breezes, gentle yet persistent, carry whispers of the impending precipitation, while the familiar fog, often a companion of the bay, positions itself in the distance, veiling the Golden Gate Bridge and adding an enigmatic quality to the skyline.\n\nTomorrow promises a continuation of this wet trend, as rain takes center stage throughout the day, with temperatures maintaining a cool demeanor, only rising to a modest high of 58 degrees before a gradual descent in the afternoon. It\u2019s a time for layers\u2014perhaps a warm sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, ideally with a sturdy umbrella in hand for those inevitable downpours. The moisture-laden air and dimly lit streets might encourage a cozy evening indoors, perhaps seasoned with the aroma of comfort food brewed at home, or a casual rendezvous in a local caf\u00e9, where soft conversations pair well with steaming mugs. For those undeterred by the rain, a stroll through one of the city's fabled parks can be a serene experience, the sound of raindrops creating a symphony accompanied by the rustling leaves, a gentle reminder of the beauty found even in less-than-perfect weather.",
