    "weather_report": "Subiaco lies under a clean, quiet sky tonight, the kind of clear that makes the streetlights seem freshly polished and the silhouettes of the jacarandas feel precise. It\u2019s a gentle, cool stretch of hours with virtually no UV, a hush that rewards an unhurried walk or the simple pleasure of a window ajar and a late page turned. By pre-dawn the stars will thin and a pale seam of light will open in the east; expect sunrise to arrive untroubled by cloud, the day sliding toward bright and honest sunshine.\n\nWith a clear start, the sun will grow insistent quickly after breakfast, so think layers: something light to take the edge off the early cool, with breathable fabrics beneath for the midday glare. A hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen will serve you well once the morning gathers pace. It looks like a pleasant day to water the garden before the warmth settles in, to hang laundry that will dry in a breeze, to run errands on foot while the shadows are still long, and to leave anything strenuous for early or late. Clarity is the theme: simple plans, a clear path, and light that sharpens the world without fuss.",
