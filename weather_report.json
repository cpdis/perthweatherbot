    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Subiaco, the gentle patter of rain takes center stage, gifting the early morning air with a refreshing coolness. The light rain continues to dance on leaves and pavements alike, casting a soft, almost dreamlike ambiance over the suburb. It's one of those days where the sun, preferring a more reserved role, stays hidden behind curtains of grey clouds, keeping the UV index mercifully low and inviting a sense of calm with its subtle presence. The day promises more of this cozy drizzle, ideal for indoor endeavours favoured in its tender embrace. \n\nConsider adorning yourself in layers \u2014 think comfortable knits or a trusty raincoat that'll shield you from the dainty showers that linger. It\u2019s a grand opportunity to indulge in unhurried activities. Perhaps a serene session with a cherished novel, the kind that transports you just enough while the world outside breathes quietly. Or an afternoon spent creating culinary delights in your kitchen, with the rhythmic rain as your muse. If you must venture out, make it a deliberate promenade under a sturdy umbrella, where each step is a contemplation, as the streets glisten with the day's miniature raindrops.",
