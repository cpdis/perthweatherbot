    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a crystal-clear sky stretches overhead, promising a night unmarred by fog or haze. The air is cool, flirting with temperatures around 45 but set to rise slightly during the night. With an easterly wind gently whispering at speeds between 1 and 18 mph, occasional gusts remind us of the city's rugged charm, sweeping through the streets and alleys. The melody of the city is hushed, inviting contemplation under a blanket of stars, perfect for a quiet stroll through the twinkling lights of the Marina or a late-night caf\u00e9 visit, where warmth mingles with aroma.\n\nLooking ahead into Monday, the sun will reign supreme, casting its golden glow upon the iconic buildings and sweeping vistas. The expected high of near 59 will maintain a relaxed demeanor as temperatures ease into the afternoon. It\u2019s a day meant for exploration; perhaps a leisurely walk across the Golden Gate, the path lined with a gentle breeze that speaks of adventures to come. As the northeast wind picks up, a light jacket should suffice, bridging the comfort of warmth while allowing one to revel in the outdoor spirit. Embrace the vibrant pulse of the city and let the day unfold at its own pace; after all, there\u2019s beauty waiting to be discovered around every corner.",
