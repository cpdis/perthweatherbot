The streets whisper with the promise of sporadic drizzle, giving way to pockets of sunshine that will peek through polite clouds, teasing a high around 55. Yet, as the day progresses, temperatures will gently descend, inviting a chill that lingers. A light breeze sweeps through, with whispers from the northwest at a leisurely pace, moving along with the subtle dance of fog that often graces this city.\n\nThe coastal marine layer, ever present, caresses the edges of the Golden Gate, creating a soft veil over the water, while the skyline stands boldly against the backdrop of a changing canvas. You'll want to don layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket to offset the coolness, complemented by a scarf to ward off the briskness of the afternoon. As the sun sets tonight, a clear sky will emerge, revealing a serene palette of twilight hues, ideal for a contemplative stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the countless cafes, where the soft hum of conversation carries the day to a gentle close.",
