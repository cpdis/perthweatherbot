    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives with a brushed-blue sky and a drift of scattered cloud, the sun bright enough to carve clean shadows on the pavement. It feels like one of those clear, workable days: light lucid, colors a touch more saturated, the air easy to breathe. Sunshine will remain generous into the afternoon with only passing veils of cloud; UV has a definite bite through early afternoon, then softens toward late day as the light turns honeyed and less insistent.\n\nDress for sun and comfort: breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a good sweep of sunscreen. It\u2019s a pleasant day for the ordinary rituals done well\u2014an unhurried lunch at a shaded table, a walk to run small errands while the streets hum, a quiet hour leafing through a book on a park bench once the glare eases. If you\u2019ve laundry to dry or a bike that needs a gentle spin, the late afternoon will oblige with kinder light and an unruffled sky.",
