    "weather_report": "Subiaco moves through early afternoon under a polished, uncomplicated blue, the sun bright and insistent, shadows sharp as paper cutouts. Visibility is clean and generous; there\u2019s nothing between you and the horizon but air. The UV is unforgiving at this hour and still strong into midafternoon, the kind that asks for shade, sunscreen, and a brimmed hat. Heat gathers without fanfare, more honest than heavy, with no cloud to blunt it.\n\nExpect the clear, crystalline feel to hold through the afternoon, the light easing only slowly toward evening. Dress light and breathable, add sunglasses, and keep water close. It\u2019s a good day for small, ordinary victories: let a load of washing drink the sun, run errands along the shadier side of the street, read by an open window, or save a gentle walk or easy bike ride for later when the glare softens. If you garden, make it brief and in patches of shade; if you\u2019re indoors, throw the curtains wide and let the brightness do the rest.",
