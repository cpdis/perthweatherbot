    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a brilliant sky, where sunny blue stretches into the distance, whispering promises of serene moments ahead. The brisk northwest breeze nudges the temperature just below a comfortable fifty-five, suggesting that one might wrap themselves in a light jacket to embrace the crisp air. As the day drifts closer to evening, wisps of clouds hint at the emerging chill, with the forecast predicting a chance of rain spreading its gray veil after the clock strikes four. \n\nThe marine layer, while not currently draping the city, remains a harbinger of an evening shift, with clouds gathering, ready to offer a gentle embrace of moisture. As the sun sets its golden tones, the atmosphere holds a unique clarity, the type that invites a simple stroll down Market Street, or perhaps enjoying a quiet table at a caf\u00e9 to relish the evolving tapestry of urban life. The promise of light showers later brings an enchanting anticipation to the evening, a perfect backdrop for settling in with a good book or nurturing conversations among friends\u2014all accompanied, perhaps, by the gentle sound of droplets pattering against windows.",
