    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the night is quiet and clean-edged, the sort of stillness where you can hear your own footsteps and pick out constellations without squinting. The forecast through the pre-dawn hours stays cloudless, a good sign that sunrise will arrive bright and uncomplicated, with hard, honest light. Expect a very sunny day ahead; clarity looks excellent and the UV will surge quickly after breakfast, the kind that paints sharp shadows and asks you to take it seriously. It should feel pleasant early, then more insistent by late morning.\n\nIf you\u2019re stepping out now, a light layer will do; by morning, reach for breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen, with water close by. This is a day for ordinary, satisfying things: an early stroll before the streets heat up, a ride to the bakery, watering the garden while the birds are busy, hanging a wash that will dry in no time, a quick run to the shops, then shade and a book when the sun turns blunt. Keep your plans simple and let the light do the decorating.",
