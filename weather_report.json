    "weather_report": "As the shadows deepen over Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the city rests under a canvas of muted clouds, tempered by fleeting patches of sunshine that peek through intermittently. With temperatures hovering around the brisk mid-fifties, the air carries a cool whisper, inviting soft layers and comfortable shoes for those who venture outdoors. The atmosphere is a blend of promise and reticence; the sun struggles to assert itself against the encroaching blanket of grey, hinting at the rain that is likely to arrive shortly after nightfall.\n\nLooking ahead, the clouds will continue to thicken into the evening, with a gentle rain expected to begin around 10 p.m., offering a soothing lullaby to those tucked in for the night. The breeze from the south-southwest adds a chill, making an extra layer prudent; a light jacket or a cardigan would serve you well. In this temperate yet foreboding landscape, the mellow hues of the skyline encourage quiet pursuits\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, or an afternoon spent with a novel at home, all while the scent of rain hovers ever closer, enriching the air and promising the refreshment of a coming storm.",
