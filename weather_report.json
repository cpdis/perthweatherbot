    "weather_report": "Midday in Mount Pleasant is bright and open, the sky mostly clear with a scatter of easygoing clouds drifting through. The sun has the upper hand, so expect good light and a dry day, the sort that sharpens edges and makes colors feel honest. UV looks moderate around the early afternoon, enough for sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen if you linger, easing as the sun tilts later. No drama on the horizon, just a gentle, agreeable day that invites unhurried errands and small pleasures.\n\nIt feels like a light-layer day: a soft sweater or a thin jacket over a comfortable shirt, shoes you can walk in, and shades in your pocket. If you have the time, take lunch outside or slip out for a short loop through the neighborhood; let the sunshine do its quiet work. Open a window, air out a room, water the plants, or sit by a bright pane with a book you\u2019ve been meaning to finish. The afternoon should remain pleasantly clear, with just enough cloud to give the sky character.",
