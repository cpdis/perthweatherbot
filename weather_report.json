    "weather_report": "As night drapes its velvety cloak over Downtown San Francisco, the air is punctuated by an impending rainfall, emerging softly after four in the morning. The temperature, a cool whisper hovering around 50 degrees, promises to cradle into a slightly warmer embrace as the night deepens. Tonight's skies, swathed in the gauzy remnants of partly cloudy patches, suggest only a fleeting glimpse of clarity before the rain sets in, making the surrounding hills and the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge appear both mystical and elusive. The west wind rustles gently, a reminder of nature's rhythm, while the chance of precipitation rises to a notable 60%, hinting at a mischievous drizzle ready to roll over the city\u2019s bustling streets.\n\nTomorrow, as the dawn breaks, anticipate a day laced with more persistent showers, particularly before the afternoon transforms into a partly sunny tableau. Expect the high to gaze slightly past 57 degrees. The southwest winds will beckon at 6 to 12 mph, ushering in the fresh scent of rain-soaked earth. Whether to an indoor caf\u00e9, where the warmth and aroma of freshly brewed coffee call, or through a simple stroll around the quiet corners of a nearby park, the day beckons casual comfort. Dress for the occasion in layers, perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, as the weather oscillates between cool respite and the tantalizing dampness of rain. Perfect for some quiet reflection or an afternoon spent leafing through the pages of a long-neglected novel while the city hums softly outside.",
