    "weather_report": "As the evening unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and the sky is mostly clear, adorned with the faintest sigh of warmth as temperatures linger around 46 degrees, nudging gently towards 48 through the night. The soft whisper of a southeast wind dances through the streets, adding a touch of coolness to the atmosphere. With no immediate threat of fog masking the iconic views, those familiar silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge hold their ground against a backdrop of a star-studded expanse.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, wake to the gentle caress of sunlight as haze rises with the dawn, yielding to a sunny disposition by mid-morning. While temperatures are set to reach a pleasant 62 degrees, a gradual cooling will grace the afternoon. On this delightful day, wrapped in a layer of warmth yet prepared for the coolness to return later, it's wise to don a light jacket over a well-fitted sweater, embodying both style and practicality. Embrace the clear skies for a leisurely stroll through the streets vibrant with life or perhaps visit local caf\u00e9s to savor a warm drink, relishing the subtle shift of seasons that this December afternoon promises.",
