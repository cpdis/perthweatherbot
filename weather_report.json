    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a soft blanket of fog that lingers just before the sun makes its grand entrance. As daylight creeps in, the city greets fleeting moments of clarity interspersed with the remnants of a marine layer that stubbornly drapes over the northern bay, subtly embracing the iconic Golden Gate. With a high gently teasing near 58, the temperature sees a gradual descent into the afternoon, teasing the warmth but leaning on the cool side as the sun climbs higher and wisps of gray dissolve. \n\nTonight, the air will crisp, settling into a tranquil embrace around 48 degrees, marked by a gentle breeze stirring from the north. The world feels inviting, perfect for a casual evening stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps indulging in a cozy caf\u00e9 moment or a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, absorbing the serene ambiance as city lights twinkle against the deepening dusk. Dress warmly in layers, allowing for the quick slip from the cool air to the occasional warmth of the sun, and relish in the unique blend of fog and clarity that characterizes this beautiful stretch of the Bay Area.",
