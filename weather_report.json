    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the air is thick with the promise of rain, a steady rhythm that will soon blanket the city. The clouds huddle together in a heavy embrace, obscuring the distant outlines of the Golden Gate, a sight always so striking yet now hidden. The breeze carries a weight that whispers of impending storms, with gusts that sway trees and rustle remnants of autumn leaves still clinging to their branches. If you are out and about this night, a sturdy umbrella and a warm coat are essentials, as temperatures will meander around the low fifties.\n\nThursday morning brings no respite, with rains that will dance their way across the region before dawn breaks, punctuated by the sound of thunder echoing through the canyons of concrete. As the day progresses, rain and brief thunderstorms will paint the skyline gray, the sunlight struggling for a foothold. The air will cool slightly by afternoon, suggesting a cozy day best spent indoors. Perhaps curl up in a favorite caf\u00e9 with a book that you've been meaning to read, as the rain drums softly against the windows. The marine layer will linger, cloaking the horizons, leaving you with the comforting sound of water cascading down as the clouds continue their solemn march overhead.",
