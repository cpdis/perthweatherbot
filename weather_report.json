    "weather_report": "The morning light bathes Downtown San Francisco in a gentle, golden glow, as the promise of a mostly sunny day unfolds. Temperatures are nudging towards the upper fifties, sliding comfortably into the afternoon at just shy of sixty. A light north wind carries whispers of the ocean, promising a refreshing escape from the hustle of city life. While fog clings tenaciously to the edges, primarily around the Golden Gate and along the coastline, the city skyline stands clear and proud\u2014a rough silhouette against the vast blue sky.\n\nAs twilight approaches, clouds will begin to dance into the picture, hinting at a soft chance of rain after the night deepens. With temperatures settling around fifty, it would be wise to layer a light jacket over your clothes. Today calls for casual comfort\u2014perhaps a warm sweater and a light scarf, perfect for an afternoon stroll by the water or a cozy gathering at a local caf\u00e9. The tranquility of lesser crowds may invite a peaceful walk through Golden Gate Park, or simply a moment to reflect while sitting on a sun-drenched bench, watching the world go by. As day turns to night, seek refuge indoors or enjoy the first drops of rain, savoring the stillness that fills the air.",
