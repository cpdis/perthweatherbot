    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts through the small hours under a clean, quiet sky; the stars look freshly polished, the air a touch cool on the cheeks, and the UV nowhere to be found. It feels calm and inviting rather than cold, the kind of night that softens voices and slows footsteps.\n\nThe forecast holds that clarity through dawn: clear skies to first light, then a bright, unclouded morning. Expect plenty of sunshine once the sun lifts, with UV gentle at sunrise but quick to assert itself by midmorning. A light layer or cardigan suits the pre-dawn amble; switch to short sleeves, sunglasses, and a hat as the day opens up, and keep a dab of sunscreen handy if you\u2019ll linger outdoors. These are good hours for simple things: a slow circuit of the block while the streets are hushed, watering the garden before the light grows sharp, an early coffee run on foot, or a short ride at first light before the day gathers pace. The mood is quietly pleasant, crisp and uncomplicated, with long sightlines and honest light.",
