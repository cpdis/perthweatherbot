    "weather_report": "Evening in Subiaco has settled into a calm hush; the sky is mostly clear now, with a few friendly clouds penciled in for the small hours. The sun has long bowed out and with it the UV sting, leaving only the soft dark and streetlamp glow. It looks like an uncomplicated night\u2014clean horizons, good visibility, and a sense of ease rather than drama. Expect a pleasant run of weather through tonight: clear to start, then scattered clouds drifting over like slow thoughts.\n\nDress for comfort in a light layer\u2014something you can slip off if you\u2019re moving and back on when you pause. It\u2019s a good night to take an unhurried walk to return that book, water the pots, or sit by an open window and let the quiet air in while you answer the last messages of the day. If you step outside, give yourself a minute to look up; the sky is cooperative, and the night feels well-mannered.",
