    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a heavy quilt of clouds, with rain already pattering gently against windows. The air feels cool and damp, settling in with a low temperature that barely breaks past the chill of fifty degrees. This is not a day for sunbathing or strolls in the park; instead, it invites a retreat into warm cafes or a chance to soak up the ambiance of bustling bookstores. Visibility is notably limited, with the famed Golden Gate Bridge cloaked in mist, suggesting that the marine layer is heavy but typical of this season.\n\nAs the day progresses, the forecast hints at persistent rain, with a 90% chance to drench the streets in quiet solitude. The gentle wind wafts from the southeast, whispering through the city, bringing with it the scent of the Pacific. On such overcast days, embracing layers becomes essential\u2014a cozy sweater under a waterproof jacket paired with sturdy shoes to navigate the slick sidewalks. For those suited up against the weather, a visit to a local gallery or perhaps an afternoon of warm soup and freshly baked bread feels most appropriate, as the city drapes itself in its signature gray cloak of allure. Whether you find comfort in conversation or the pages of a well-worn novel, the rain offers a perfect backdrop to slow down and reflect.",
