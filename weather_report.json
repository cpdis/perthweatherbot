    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, San Francisco awakens beneath a canopy of stars, the air crisp and invigorating as temperatures taper to a cool embrace of 52 degrees. A gentle northwest wind whispers through the city\u2019s streets, setting the stage for a day of sunlit promise. As dawn breaks, a golden warmth will spill over the skyline, inviting residents to step outside with renewed energy. The forecast brings a radiant high near 68, although the afternoon might usher in an embrace of 63 degrees, a subtle reminder of the season's transition.\n\nThe skies will remain clear, marked by a lack of fog, allowing vistas of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and the sprawling city to emerge unimpeded. Today\u2019s bright conditions could inspire a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps a visit to the ferry building where the aromas of fresh-baked bread mingle with the briny breath of the bay. Layering is advisable, as the morning chill gives way to a warmer afternoon; a light jacket paired with comfortable clothing would suffice for an enjoyable day outdoors. In this enchanting city, every corner beckons for exploration, and today, the canvas is a masterpiece painted by the sun.",
