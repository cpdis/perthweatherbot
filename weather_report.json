    "weather_report": "Late morning in Katy arrives with a clear, polished sky and only a few unhurried clouds drifting the horizon. The light has that winter-quiet gleam\u2014bright but gentle\u2014so the UV will stay on the mild side for most of the day, more a nudge than a sting, though sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go amiss. Air clarity looks good, the sort that sharpens edges and colors without heat shimmer, and the day should hold mostly sunny with only brief veils of cloud.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for light layers: a soft long-sleeve, maybe a sweater or light jacket if you linger in shade or catch a breeze. Take a late-morning walk, let the sunlight do its quiet work, or run a few errands without the slog of humidity. A patio coffee, a tidy-up of the porch plants, a slow browse through the grocery aisles\u2014ordinary rituals made a touch more pleasant by the clean blue overhead. If you have time later, park near the edge of town and watch the sky deepen, unhurried and clear.",
