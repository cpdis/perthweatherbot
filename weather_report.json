    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the enveloping clouds cast a soft, grey veil over the skyline as the temperature hovers near a brisk 58 degrees before settling around 55. The air carries a gentle southern breeze, making for a somewhat cool ambiance, not unpleasant but certainly indicative of the impending shift in weather. As twilight descends, the forecast promises rain starting later, a steady patter anticipated after 10 PM, while temperatures will rise slightly to around 54 overnight. It's a time when the city\u2019s iconic hills may appear as mere shadows against the vibrant urban glow, their outlines softened by the low-hanging clouds.\n\nAs the evening draws near, one might find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, warmed by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, or perhaps seek refuge in a snug spot with a good book. With the chance of precipitation looming high, dressing in layers becomes a prudent choice\u2014think a light water-resistant jacket over a warm sweater, perfect for transitioning from the damp chill outside to the inviting warmth within. Clarity might be obscured by the marine layer, yet the city has its own charm tonight, inviting a quiet introspection and the kind of serene beauty that thrives just beyond the fog.",
