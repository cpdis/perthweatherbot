    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the skyline stands resolute against a clear canvas, faintly illuminated beneath the crisp December stars. With a refreshing chill settling into the air, temperatures hover around the low forties, nudging upwards as night gives way to dawn. A gentle wind, stirring from the east-northeast, whispers through the streets, carrying with it a refreshing promise of an exquisite morning. Tomorrow, the sun will rise to grace the city with its warm, albeit subdued, golden light, ushering in a day painted in soft blues and whispers of white, as the clouds remain at bay.\n\nThose planning to traverse the heart of the city should find solace in layers; a light jacket over a cozy sweater will counter the Bay's embrace. The day unfolds under mostly sunny skies, inviting strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet afternoon at a caf\u00e9, where the chatter of patrons can dance harmoniously with the soft sounds of the city. As the vibrant energy of the day wanes, consider a slow walk across the Golden Gate, where the breathtaking views of the shimmering bay meet the horizon. This may well be a day for simple pleasures, for even amidst the calm, the charm of San Francisco beckons to those who listen closely.",
