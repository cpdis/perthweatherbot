    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco settles under a pewter sky, the light soft and a little tired. Forecasts point to passing bands of light rain, more grey than bright, with only brief, milky hints of sun at best. Expect a muted day for UV; it stays low under the cloud, though any short burst of brightness around lunchtime can still nip at exposed skin. The air looks clean, the horizon clear, but the scene is glazed with damp\u2014streets darkened, leaves shining, that calm, preoccupied hush that comes before another shower.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of weather that rewards light layers and a compact rain shell, shoes that won\u2019t mind a wet footpath, and perhaps a small umbrella for the stop\u2011start drizzle. Pleasant if you like a gentle, cooling day; a touch dull if you crave sparkle. Good for a late lunch near a window, a bookstore or library errand, or a short walk between showers with a coffee in hand. If you\u2019re set on being outdoors, keep it unhurried and opportunistic\u2014watch the cloud seams for a break, then make your move.",
