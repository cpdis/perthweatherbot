    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a soft grey canopy, the morning light diffused like gauze over verandas and shopfronts. The sun is a rumor behind the cloudbank, offering only brief, milky glimmers; visibility is clean but edges are softened, the day more watercolor than ink. UV will still assert itself around midday, even through the veil, so it is a day for quiet caution rather than bravado.\n\nExpect light, passing showers to drift in through late morning and into the afternoon, the kind that freckle pavements and leave the air smelling rinsed and mild. It\u2019s pleasant in a subdued way\u2014cool enough to feel crisp, gentle enough to invite a stroll between awnings. Dress in breathable layers with a light waterproof or compact umbrella, comfortable shoes you don\u2019t mind getting a little damp, and a touch of sunscreen if you linger outdoors. This is a good day to nurse a coffee by a window, browse the stacks at the library, poke through a grocer\u2019s aisles for something fresh, or take a slow detour through a gallery\u2014errands and small pleasures threaded together at an easy pace.",
