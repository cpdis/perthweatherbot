    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds clear and serene, wrapped in a gentle embrace of sunlight that dances softly across the cityscape. With the sun ascending, temperatures hover near a refreshing sixty degrees, hinting at a pleasant day ahead. A light breeze whispers through the streets, carrying away the remnants of the night, while the horizon remains uncluttered, free from fog's usual grasp. There is a palpable clarity in the air, painting the buildings and landmarks in crisp, vivid detail.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect temperatures to drift downwards a bit, settling into the comfortable realm of the late afternoon. With nighttime approaching, the cool will invite layers, suggesting a light sweater or jacket for those venturing out. While the misty marine layer of the bay is absent today, the fresh air invites outdoor reflections. Perhaps a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment spent at a local caf\u00e9, warmed by a cup of coffee, could be the perfect way to savor this unfolding tranquility in the heart of the city.",
