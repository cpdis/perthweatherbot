    "weather_report": "Before dawn, San Francisco sits under a soft, unbroken lid of cloud, the kind that mutes the streetlights and makes the pavement glow faintly. The morning looks set to stay overcast through the late breakfast hours, with little in the way of sun and a low UV index; visibility should be fine, but the light will be even and gray, shadows kept on a short leash. Expect a cool, reserved day rather than a dramatic one, the sort that invites unhurried plans and quiet errands.\n\nDress in layers you can live in: a light sweater under a windproof jacket, comfortable shoes, maybe a scarf for the damp edge. It\u2019s pleasant in a contemplative way\u2014good for a lingering coffee by a window, an early grocery run before the crowds, or a neighborhood walk where the sound of buses and bakery doors sets the tempo. If the ceiling holds, keep outdoor plans simple and close to home; if you root for brightness, watch for a brief brightening late morning, but don\u2019t count on it.",
