    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush, the sky clean and star-scrubbed, with the first hints of dawn waiting in the wings. A clear morning is on tap, and once the sun lifts, it should pour down unfiltered, sharpening edges and brightening colors. Expect the kind of crystalline clarity that makes street trees look freshly drawn. As the light strengthens, the UV will climb quickly for this time of year, so think of shade and sunscreen once morning settles in.\n\nIt feels like a gentle start that turns confidently sunny. Dress in light layers for the early chill, then shift to breathable fabrics, sunglasses, and a hat as the day opens up. Good hours for a quiet walk to the bakery, a coffee at an outdoor table, or airing the house while you water the pots. Hang a load of washing; it should dry without fuss. If you\u2019re commuting, a leisurely cycle or an unhurried stroll will suit the mood, and by late morning the sun may feel insistent enough to make you linger on the shadier side of the street.",
