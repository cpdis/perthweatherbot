    "weather_report": "Busselton passes the afternoon under a clean, untroubled sky, the kind of clear that sharpens edges and throws long, honeyed shadows across the street. The sun is still assertive at this hour, bright and unfiltered; UV will ease toward dusk but has a little bite yet, so a hat, sunglasses, and a dab of sunscreen wouldn\u2019t go astray. The sea air feels tidy and salt-lean, and visibility is crisp, promising a transparent slide into evening.\n\nExpect the clarity to hold through sunset and on into a mild, starry night. Dress light and breathable now, then keep a soft layer handy for after dark. It\u2019s the sort of late day that suits modest errands and small pleasures: take a quiet loop around the block, bring the washing in before the chill, water the garden, or roll an easy few minutes on the bike path while the light goes amber. Supper outdoors or by an open window would sit nicely with the mood.",
