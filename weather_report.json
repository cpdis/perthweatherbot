    "weather_report": "As the evening settles softly over Downtown San Francisco, the skies offer a tranquil clarity, gently illuminated by the fading light. The temperature drops gracefully toward a crisp 45 degrees, inviting a refreshing breeze from the northwest that whispers through the streets. Tonight's charm lies in its serene openness, lacking the usual fog that often blankets the Bay Area. With winds barely brushing 8 mph, one can relish in the stillness, where the stark outline of the city against the night sky brings a sense of calm.\n\nTomorrow promises a sun-drenched day, the warmth of a high near 60 degrees permeating through the cool morning air. As the day unfolds, the charming allure of Northeast winds at around 6 mph will accompany those venturing outdoors\u2014perfect for a stroll through Golden Gate Park or a quiet moment with a book at a caf\u00e9. As the sun takes its journey across the azure sky, dress layers wisely; a light jacket or sweater will suffice for the morning chill, giving way to comfortable warmth as the afternoon beckons. Embrace these moments, savoring the delightful contrast of sun and breeze, as the city hums with the sounds of its daily life, alive yet calm.",
