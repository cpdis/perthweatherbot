    "weather_report": "In the embrace of night, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in a delicate veil of patchy fog, casting a whisper of mystery over the familiar skyline. The air, cool and crisp, lingers just above 49 degrees, while gentle winds from the west-northwest stir softly, hardly more than a breath against the skin. As the city rests, the fog curls around the edges of the landscape, creating an ethereal panorama that blurs the boundaries between the known and the enigmatic.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the forecast offers a promise of clarity. Morning fog may linger briefly, but as the sun breaks through the clouds, the day will gradually turn mostly sunny. Temperatures are set to hover near 58 degrees, softening to around 55 as the afternoon unfolds, perfectly inviting for those who wish to explore the neighborhoods or perhaps venture along the waterfront. For attire, a light jacket would serve well against the initial coolness of the morning, easily shed as the sun\u2019s rays warm the heart of the day. Given the conditions, it would be delightful to saunter along the Embarcadero, coffee in hand, or find a cozy caf\u00e9 to indulge in the rich tapestry of local flavors. The city, with its eclectic charm, awaits those who welcome the day, wrapped in the serene embrace of its maritime influences.",
