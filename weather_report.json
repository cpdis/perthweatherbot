    "weather_report": "As we find our bearings on this pleasantly ordinary day in Subiaco, we're greeted by an expansive clear sky. It fans out above, an impeccable dome of azure suffused with whispers of lunar silver courtesy of our celestial companion. The air is crisp, and there's a hush in the atmosphere; one might liken the scene to the precious hush of dawn before the day stirs awake, despite the hours indicating deep into the night. The sun may be absent, but the stunning clarity of the day persists, inspiring sentiments of tranquility and peace. \n\nWith no impending flurry or tempest on the horizon, your attire could veer towards the lighter end of the spectrum. A comfortable ensemble accommodating the Bay breeze, perhaps. On such a day, a brisk walk amidst the architectural charm of the city or a peaceful musing by the serene Swan River could be just the right measure of contentment. Savor the occasional splash of light reflected off tranquil waters, a spectacle that must be seen, not merely described. As the night sky unveils its macrame of stars, perhaps indulge in a bit of star gazing; a homage to the universe and our place in it.",
