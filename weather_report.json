    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, the air carries a cool, muted atmosphere, a soft blanket of gray clouds settling over the city as it prepares for the day ahead. As the sun rises, its light struggles to pierce through the encroaching overcast. The forecast hints at a slight chance of rain later in the day, and already, the day feels heavy with the promise of moisture. With temperatures hovering around a brisk sixty degrees, the wind flows gently from the east, barely ruffling the weary leaves of trees lining the streets.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect a greater likelihood of rain, with the clouds thickening further, casting a subdued light over the city. Tonight will bring a more pronounced dampness, coaxing the scent of wet pavement and earth into the air. For those venturing out, a light jacket should suffice, not just for warmth but to guard against the impending drizzle. Layers are wise; a cozy sweater beneath that jacket will offer comfort against the chill. If you find yourself yearning for something to do, consider a stroll through a nearby caf\u00e9, perhaps indulging in a warm drink while people-watching, or meandering through art-filled neighborhoods, taking in the city\u2019s rhythm as it prepares for the night. Though the sky may seem dreary, the city has a certain charm in the cooler months that speaks to the spirit of San Francisco.",
