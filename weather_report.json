    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the city lies beneath a quilt of partially obscured stars, with a cool breeze whispering through the streets. The temperature drifts gently toward a low of around 47 degrees, while a mild north-northeast wind stirs at about six miles per hour. Tomorrow holds the promise of patchy fog in the morning hours, giving way to a partly sunny day. Anticipate a high near 58, slowly easing into the mid-50s by afternoon, as the sun peeks through the clouds, revealing its warm touch upon the resilient city.\n\nTonight's atmosphere feels serene yet crisp, comfortably inviting you to don a light jacket as you venture out. It's the perfect evening to grab a warm beverage from a nearby caf\u00e9 and take a tranquil stroll along the waterfront, where the echoing sounds of distant laughter and the gentle lap of the waves create a soothing backdrop. As dawn approaches, those with a penchant for a cozy start can find comfort in the fog's embrace, perhaps capturing the soft silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge shrouded in marine layer\u2014a scene that reminds us of nature\u2019s delicate interplay with urban life. Embrace the evening's coolness and the day\u2019s potential for beauty in its dusk-to-dawn transition.",
