    "weather_report": "As twilight descends on Downtown San Francisco, a shroud of clouds and rain envelops the city, painting an atmosphere rich with moisture and movement. The whispering warmth of the evening air blends with the dampness, heralding a night filled with the rhythmic patter of raindrops. The low temperature teeters around a comfortable 55 degrees, accompanied by brisk winds that whisk through the streets, carrying the promise of prolonged rainfall. With gusts reaching up to 24 mph, it is a moment to secure your umbrella and perhaps don a light jacket, as the persistent rain is expected to accumulate, nourishing the earth beneath.\n\nOn Sunday, the forecast foretells an equally damp day, with the rain continuing its gentle assault. The high will hover near 59, yielding to a gradual drop as afternoon settles in. These weathered skies offer a perfect backdrop for an afternoon of introspection. One might find solace in the cozy embrace of a local caf\u00e9, cradling a warm drink while watching the parade of umbrellas glide past the window. Alternatively, take a slow stroll through one of the city\u2019s tranquil parks, where the soft ground hugs your steps and the scent of rain-kissed greenery fills the air. Evening plans may call for a movie or a visit to a gallery, where the warmth of indoor spaces becomes invitingly essential amidst the crisp wetness outside.",
