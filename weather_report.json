    "weather_report": "West Perth wakes under a lid of cloud, the light silvery and thin, the day hushed as if the city were speaking softly. Expect the first shy drops late in the morning, then a steadier, more purposeful rain through early afternoon. Sunshine will be fleeting at best; the UV looks subdued under this blanket, though a brief bright gap could still catch unguarded skin. The air will feel clean and cool, the horizon a little smudged by showers, streets taking on that dark, rain-polished sheen that makes colors quietly vivid.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for a light waterproof and comfortable layers, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and an umbrella that knows its job. If you\u2019ve errands, take them on before the rain settles in; otherwise, let the afternoon be gentle work indoors: a tidy of the desk, a slow simmer on the stove, a library visit, or a short tram or bus hop to somewhere with a good window and better coffee. When the rain eases, step out for a brisk loop around the block and breathe the softened air.",
