    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the streets are hushed and the sky is shifting toward clarity. Broken cloud is expected to drift through in the small hours, then thin to just a few clouds by dawn, leaving the night dry and calm with decent visibility and a gentle coolness that settles into the gardens.\n\nAfter sunrise, expect a clean, bright morning with generous sunshine and a crisp, well-defined light rather than haze. UV will climb briskly through the morning and be high by late morning, so plan on sunscreen, a brimmed hat, and sunglasses if you\u2019re outdoors. Dress in light layers: something comfortable for the early chill, easy to shed to short sleeves as the day opens up. It\u2019s a day made for unhurried errands and small pleasures\u2014an early stroll for fresh bread, a quiet ride to the shops, a bit of pottering in the garden before the sun sharpens, or a slow coffee by a window while the neighborhood brightens.",
