    "weather_report": "As night drapes over Downtown San Francisco, the slight threat of rain flits through the air, hinting at the dampness to come. The evening's low rests comfortably at 48, suggesting that a light jacket or sweater might be a welcome companion against the cool breeze whispering from the south. The clouds above, a mix of moisture and shadow, promise rain to follow as the night matures. With a 30% chance of precipitation before the early hours, pedestrians might find themselves both enchanted and somewhat damped by sporadic droplets\u2014perfect for those who savor the rhythm of rain on city streets.\n\nCome Sunday, expect a moody tableau to unfold, cloaked in clouds and the promise of rain. The temperature will subtly descend as the hours pass, creating a cool, damp atmosphere, where the air carries a freshness that invigorates the soul. The 80% chance of rain suggests a more sustained shower, so while the view of the Golden Gate may be elusive behind the clouds, it's an opportune day to embrace indoor pursuits. Consider taking a leisurely stroll through the city's vibrant coffee shops or perhaps stepping into an art gallery where the rain will merely accentuate your experience. Indeed, in this whimsical weather, the city invites you to savor the intimate pleasures of the season: a good book by the window and a warm cup of something comforting.",
