    "weather_report": "Dallas moves through midday under a high, well-combed sky, the clouds thinning to wisps that only soften the sun. The light is bright but winter-gentle, with a modest UV bite that suggests sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen rather than alarm. Air feels clear and steady, the horizons sharp; it\u2019s a day that makes colors honest and shadows tidy. Overall, pleasantly mild and easy to be in, more invitation than challenge.\n\nDress in easy layers: a soft long-sleeve or light sweater, a jacket you can shrug off, comfortable shoes for wandering. It\u2019s a good time to run errands without hurry, sit by a window for a late lunch, or take a simple walk through the neighborhood and let the cool brightness restore your head. If you\u2019re headed out longer, bring lip balm and a hat; if you\u2019re staying in, crack a window and let the clean air drift through the room.",
