    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Perth and the sky is mostly clear, just a few cottony clouds idling as the sun tilts west. The light is bright but softening, the air clean and visibility keen; it feels like a day that has stayed sunny and uncomplicated. UV was fierce earlier, now easing quickly toward low as dusk approaches; if you\u2019re out before sunset, a hat and a smear of sunscreen are still sensible.\n\nThrough the early evening the outlook stays steady\u2014few clouds, no drama\u2014so expect a pleasant, open sky and an easy slide into twilight. Dress light and breathable for now, with a soft layer ready when the warmth lets go. Good hours for unhurried things: water the plants, fetch a small shop, hang a late load of washing, or sit on the balcony and let the last gold spill over the page of a book. If a stretch is needed, take a short loop around the block and watch the day fold itself away.",
