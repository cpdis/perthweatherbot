    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a tapestry of shifting clouds punctuated by grey. Rain is anticipated, cascading from an overcast sky as temperatures begin to wane from a high near 59. A gentle southwest breeze whispers through the streets, carrying droplets poised to fall as the afternoon light dims. The chance of precipitation looms at 60%, hinting at a damp ambiance that may inspire a cozy retreat indoors or a leisurely walk under an umbrella. \n\nAs the sun surrenders to twilight tonight, the rain is set to linger until around 10 PM, giving way to partial clouds and a cool low of about 48. Gusty winds from the west-northwest will stir the air, adding a brisk note to the twilight chill. For those venturing out, layering becomes essential; a warm jacket over a light sweater, accompanied by sturdy footwear for the slick streets, will ensure comfort. Given the weather's temperamental nature, one might find solace in a quiet caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while the world outside dances in rain-soaked serenity, or perhaps lose themselves in the pages of a book, as the city turns inwards for the evening.",
