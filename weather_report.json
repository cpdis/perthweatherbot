    "weather_report": "The day in Downtown San Francisco carries a cool, slightly unsettled air, with clouds lingering ominously above. As the afternoon progresses, a gentle pattering of rain may join the mix, but for now, a blend of sun and clouds creates a dimly lit canvas, with high temperatures barely crawling to the low sixties. The signature west wind sweeps through, punctuating the atmosphere with brisk gusts that tease the edges of jackets.\n\nTonight, the chance of rain remains, teasing the concept of shelter as the temperature dips into the cool forties. Those venturing out are advised to don layers that marry warmth with the ability to breathe in the cooler evening air. A light raincoat might not go amiss, particularly for those daring enough to take a stroll along the waterfront or savor a quiet moment in one of the parks. With this fleeting shift in weather, it\u2019s an ideal evening to seek refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9 or a local eatery, enjoying the company of friends or mulling over a good book, as the city softly glimmers under the scattered clouds and fading light.",
