Under a vast expanse of blue sky, the air is crisp and clear, devoid of the usual fog that dances around the bay. Today\u2019s high approaches a gentle 55, kissed by the north-northwest breezes murmuring softly at 8 mph. As evening unfolds, anticipate tranquility with the temperature dipping to a slight 42, enveloped by clarity that outlasts the dusk.\n\nAs the city stirs to life, consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sparkling waters reflect the sun's early glow. A light jacket will suffice against the cool air, allowing you to bask in the serenity that descends with the twilight. The absence of fog might urge some to explore the nearby hills, taking advantage of the unobstructed views that invite a contemplative pause. Whether it\u2019s a quiet moment with a coffee in hand or an afternoon spent rambling through one of the city\u2019s lively markets, today offers an opportunity to relish in the charm of this iconic landscape.",
