    "weather_report": "Perth sits under an open, polished sky at midday, the sun in full voice and the air clear enough to make edges seem newly drawn. The forecast holds to this uncluttered script through the afternoon, with bright, uninterrupted sunshine and that hard, cinematic light the city wears so well. UV will be strong into mid-afternoon on a day like this, so treat the sun with respect: hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and light, breathable layers are the uniform. It feels like a day that invites motion but counsels shade, the kind where colours look a notch more vivid and time stretches a little.\n\nIf you\u2019re stepping out now, keep it unhurried\u2014walk to the shops, collect a coffee, sit a while on a bench beneath a generous tree. Hanging a load of washing will reward you with quick dry lines; a quiet hour of reading on a shaded patio would suit the moment. As the sun softens later, a gentle loop around the neighbourhood or a meandering bike ride along familiar streets will feel just right, with a clear, honeyed sunset likely to close the day.",
