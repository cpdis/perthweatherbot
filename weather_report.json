    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a somber veil of gray cloud stretches across the sky, hinting at the rain that is soon to wash over the streets. With temperatures flirting with a coolness that hovers around fifty-nine degrees, the air carries a brisk bite, driven by the south wind that weaves through the city at a lively clip, occasionally gusting with energy. The certainty of rain hangs thick with a swelling 90% chance, promising that the droplets will soon descend, bringing with them a modest rejuvenation of the landscape. \n\nTransitioning into the evening, the rain will intensify, and a low of fifty-six invites a sense of introspection, suggesting that cozying up indoors might be the most appealing option. If venturing out, layering is essential; a sturdy jacket, perhaps one that repels moisture, would guard against the elements, complemented by a well-fitted scarf and water-resistant footwear for navigating puddles that might gather on the sidewalks. Quiet cafes, warm libations, and rich conversations beckon from beyond the gloom, making this an evening well spent in the company of friends or the gentle solace of a good book as the city\u2019s profile dissolves into mist and shadow.",
