    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco rises with a gentle, sunny embrace, ushering in a day that holds promise beneath a vast, clear sky. The air is cool yet inviting\u2014ideal for leisurely outings as the sun climbs, casting a warm glow over the iconic skyline. From afar, the Golden Gate Bridge stands majestically, albeit cloaked in a delicate ribbon of fog that speaks to the city's intimate dance with the sea. This ethereal veil is lighter than usual, suggesting that the marine layer\u2019s retreat will reveal more of the city\u2019s contours as the day unfolds. \n\nAs temperatures dip into the mid-fifties by afternoon, layering is advised; a light jacket will shield against the chill while allowing for comfort during sunlit stretches. Ample opportunities await, from a comforting stroll along the waterfront to exploring hidden gems in the Mission District or perhaps a tranquil afternoon in Golden Gate Park, where the landscape invites contemplation. This weather promises a day that feels neither rushed nor mundane, perfect for weaving simple joys into the fabric of daily life.",
