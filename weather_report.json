    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, as the clock gently nudges towards dawn, Downtown San Francisco stirs under a soft blanket of partly cloudy sky. The city, holding its secrets close, is momentarily enveloped in a tranquil embrace with temperatures resting just shy of 45 degrees. As daylight creeps in, the promise of a mostly sunny Sunday beckons, but not before a whispered chill from the north sweeps across the landscape. Expect a modest high near 54, with afternoon breezes setting a delicate stage, coaxing the coastal fog to retreat and revealing the city\u2019s stunning contours.\n\nThe clarity of the day, while hopeful, carries hints of the usual marine layer that swirls playfully near the Golden Gate Bridge. You may find the air fresh and invigorating, yet a light jacket or sweater will be your best companion as you traverse the streets, ready for the brisk kiss of the wind. Embrace the day with quiet activities\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the Bay glimmers, inviting a moment of reflection, or indulge in a warm beverage at a corner caf\u00e9. The elegance of a low-key Sunday in San Francisco lies not in grand gestures but in savoring the simple, serene beauty of the city, one breath at a time.",
