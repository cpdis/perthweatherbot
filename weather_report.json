    "weather_report": "Subiaco spends the late afternoon under a polished blue, the kind of clear sky that makes the streets seem tidier and the gum leaves rattle with light. It\u2019s been a day of unbroken sunshine and that continues into the early evening; glare still has some bite now, with the UV that was fierce at midday easing to something more forgiving as the sun tilts west. The air feels clean and uncomplicated, the horizon sharp, the mood unhurried. Expect a lucid, mild evening that fades gently toward a quiet, starry night.\n\nDress for ease: light, breathable clothes, sunglasses, and a hat if you\u2019re out before dusk; a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray even now. Tuck a light layer under your arm for later. This is good weather for ordinary pleasures\u2014a meandering walk to post a letter, watering the herbs while the light turns honeyed, a small errand by bicycle, or a calm sit on a bench to let the day unspool. Supper outdoors would suit the sky\u2019s clear intention.",
