    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, the city lies beneath a blanket of gray, a prelude to the soft drizzle that is expected to wash over the landscape tonight. With temperatures lingering modestly around the upper 40s, it feels distinctly chillier, urging you to reach for a cozy sweater or a light jacket before stepping out. The pervasive clouds hang low, concealing the usual sights that inspire awe, including the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the sprawling cityscape, now shrouded in a veil of mist. The air carries the promise of rain, a tangible weight hinting at an 80% chance of precipitation, as soft wisps of fog dance along the hills, painting a melancholic backdrop.\n\nMoving into Friday, the forecast calls for a continuation of this liquid embrace, with rain expected to transform the city into a different realm. The drizzling will last until the midday hours before yielding fuller rainfall, leading to a cozy indoors kind of day. Wind gusts may occasionally tease with their chill, so securing a scarf or layering beneath that jacket might provide relief against the brisk air. As the world outside grows dimmer with the onset of evening, the prospect of curling up with a book at a cafe or indulging in a warm meal becomes quite inviting. With clouds merging seamlessly into fog, the city\u2019s character bends towards introspection, inviting one to slow down and savor the moment.",
