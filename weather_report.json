    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this December morning, Downtown San Francisco is shrouded in a gentle veil of rain, punctuated by gusty southwest winds whispering secrets of the Pacific. The streets glisten beneath the soft illumination of streetlights, reflecting the burgeoning moisture. As the clock ticks past one, expect rain showers to persist until the dawn, setting the tone for a day of variable skies. The promise of more rainfall looms, a delicate ballet with a 90% chance of drizzle or showers clinging to the edges of the day. \n\nAs the hours stretch toward afternoon, the clouds may concede to glimpses of sun, although they will retain their mischievous nature, swirling and shifting. As the temperature hovers in the cool upper fifties, there lies an undeniable chill in the air, demanding layers. A comfortable sweater under a waterproof coat and perhaps a sturdy umbrella will be your steadfast companions. The forecast beckons for a day spent savoring the cozy indoors. Curl up with a good book at your favorite caf\u00e9, or take a leisurely stroll through the bustling streets, enjoying the rhythmic dance of raindrops as they serenade the city. In this moment, one might find a certain poetry in the drizzle, making the promise of warmth and shelter all the more inviting.",
