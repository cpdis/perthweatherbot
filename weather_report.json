The temperature is a cool 59 degrees, dipping subtly as the afternoon wears on. A brisk west-southwest wind gusts through the streets, reminding passersby of the storm's presence, and an unmistakable sense of urgency hangs in the air, buoyed by an impressive 90% chance of precipitation. Rainfall promises to accumulate, a steady curtain of water that can paint the scene in strokes of fleeting clarity.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the night offers a chance of respite, with showers expected to taper off by 10 p.m., giving way to mostly clear skies and a lower temperature around 44 degrees. Yet, the marine layer still clings to the edges of the city, veiling parts of the Golden Gate Bridge in an ethereal mist. This weather beckons for layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy raincoat or an umbrella to brave the evening's still-looming droplets. For those unwilling to succumb to",
