    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a vast, blue canvas, brushed lightly by wisps of white cloud that seem to float effortlessly above the iconic skyline. The temperature hovers comfortably, creating a pleasant atmosphere as people find their way to parks or caf\u00e9s, relishing the sunlight that bathes the city. There is no fog in sight, allowing for clear views that extend toward the sparkling Bay and the distant ridges of Marin. A gentle northwest breeze delivers a refreshing touch, the kind that invites linger and leisure without overwhelming the senses.\n\nAs daylight gives way to evening, temperatures will dip slightly, offering a briskness that can inspire cozy attire \u2014 perhaps a light sweater or a jacket to ward off the evening chill. The night promises to be equally clear, perfect for a relaxed stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet gathering at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where conversations can flourish under the stars, embraced by the city's vibrant energy. With such delightful weather, one might consider exploring the quaint streets of North Beach or settling in for a book by a window, savoring the serenity of a San Francisco evening.",
