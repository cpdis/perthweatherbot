    "weather_report": "In Katy today the sun played shy, filtered through a quilt of cloud that eased from a solid gray this morning into a looser, brighter patchwork by midday. The light stayed soft and forgiving, UV low and unhurried, the kind that makes colors look truer and edges less sharp. By tonight the sky returns to a muted lid, with only occasional thin breaks; the air feels steady and quiet rather than harsh. It\u2019s a day that reads as gently pleasant rather than dazzling: not much glare, no real bite, a good companion for unhurried errands and small comforts. Dress in easy layers\u2014a long-sleeve shirt with a light jacket you can pocket when you warm up\u2014and save the heavy sunscreen for another day. At this hour, consider a slow neighborhood walk, a short grocery run for staples you forgot, or a tidy-up of the desk while a pot of tea hums along; let the evening do what it does best, which is calm the room.",
