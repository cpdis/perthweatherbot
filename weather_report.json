    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds drifts lazily overhead, mingling with the fading warmth of the day. The chill creeps in, ushering the temperature down to a cool 46 degrees, accompanied by a soft north-northeast wind that whispers through the streets. The ethereal glow of city lights twinkles against the darkened sky, hinting at a restless evening ahead. Tomorrow promises a dance of sunshine and the possibility of rain after 4 PM, a gentle reminder of the season's shifts. \n\nThe landscape wears a muted palette tonight, with no fog obscuring the striking vistas but the marine layer's embrace anticipated with tomorrow\u2019s clouds. In this cool embrace, a light jacket and perhaps a warm scarf will serve well for evening strolls or casual wanderings through nearby cafes. A quiet dinner, a delve into a bookstore, or a leisurely wander through local galleries would suit this tranquil yet brisk night, offering moments of warmth and inspiration in the heart of the city.",
