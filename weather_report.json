    "weather_report": "Swanbourne wakes in a hush before sunrise, the sky clean as polished glass and the air holding a faint coastal cool. Stars are slipping away, and the horizon has that thin promise of amber. It feels calm and very clear, the sort of early hour where sounds carry and the day seems to wait politely at the door.\n\nOnce the sun breaks, expect a spotless, sunny morning that warms quickly. With such unbroken blue, the UV will ramp up fast and likely sit very high by late morning, so plan shade for the middle of the day. It looks pleasant overall: gentle now, bright and a touch relentless later. A light layer is right for this hour, then shift to breathable clothes, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and steady sunscreen. Good moments today are the unhurried ones: a short stroll along quiet streets before breakfast, coffee on the porch, hanging a wash that will dry in no time, a small grocery run or bike errand before the glare takes hold, then a pause with a book by an open window while the sea breeze finds its way inland.",
