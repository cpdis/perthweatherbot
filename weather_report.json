    "weather_report": "As night drapes its serene blanket over Downtown San Francisco, the air feels cool and crisp, with lingering clouds softly obscuring the moon. The temperature hovers around 46 degrees, invigorated by a gentle north-northeast breeze whispering at 7 miles per hour. The evening skies hint at a shift to brighter conditions that await with dawn's arrival. \n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the city will revel in mostly sunny splendor, offering a respite from the evening's muted tones. Daytime highs will flirt with the low 60s, gradually receding to a comfortable 57 by afternoon. The breeze will pick up slightly, but it promises to be a day filled with clarity, even as the vestiges of the marine layer may persist in the distance, caressing the coastline and possibly casting a fleeting shadow over the land. This is a perfect day for a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or perhaps an artisan coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9, where one might embrace the warmth of a thatched sweater or a light jacket. The air, while fresh, won\u2019t require heavy layers, just enough to enjoy the gentle warmth of midday sun against the cool air.",
