    "weather_report": "As the sun dips below the horizon in Subiaco, the essence of an idyllic spring day lingers in the air. The skies, crystal clear with a touch of serenity, paint a vivid picture of what earlier hours promised. The day, devoid of clouds, offered an unfiltered shower of golden sunshine, casting long, languid shadows and bathing the town in warmth. Now, as twilight grips the landscape, the air holds onto the gentle warmth, a reminder of the sun's earlier caress. Dressing light is advisable, a comfortable shirt for the warmth and perhaps a scarf for the cool embrace of evening. With the day behind and the night unfurling its gentle cloak, one might stroll leisurely through quiet streets or find solace on a terrace with a favorite book, savoring the transition from light to dusk. There is an undeniable clarity in the air, yet the absence of explicit forecasts suggesting high UV exposure allows one to move freely and without concern. As daylight wanes, evening\u2019s calm invites reflection, its gentle whisper a perfect counterpoint to the rush of day - a time to enjoy the simple joy of being where you are.",
