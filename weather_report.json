    "weather_report": "As the evening envelops Downtown San Francisco, the sky remains mostly clear, granting a serene haze to the city. With temperatures dipping down to a cool 42 degrees, a gentle breeze whispered through the streets, creating a refreshing contrast against the warmth of a cozy indoor retreat. The day ahead promises sunshine, but the air feels crisp with anticipation, hinting that the sun\u2019s ascent will only bring a modest high near 56 degrees, giving way to a cooling charm by afternoon. \n\nThe evening twilight bathes the landscape in soft shadows, with hints of marine fog lingering just beyond the familiar skyline. The cycle of day and night is evident in the way the city lights twinkle like stars that have found their way to Earth, momentarily overshadowing the chill of the night. This is a perfect moment for a leisurely stroll, perhaps along the Embarcadero or through the winding streets of the Mission, where the aroma of roasted coffee mingles with the cool air. As the weather suggests relishing the outdoors, a light jacket would serve well against the evening's crispness, maintaining warmth while allowing one to savor the sensations that a San Francisco night effortlessly brings.",
