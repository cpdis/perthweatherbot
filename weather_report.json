    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of cloudiness drapes the city, with temperatures resting around 46 degrees. The north-northeast breeze whispers softly through the streets, a reminder of the night's chill. This nocturnal calm hints at a brighter day ahead; dawn will unveil a sunny embrace, with the afternoon bringing warmth that peaks around 61 before settling back to a cooler 57. \n\nWhile the morning may hold onto some low clouds, the promise of clearer skies at noon depicts a perfect opportunity for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero, a visit to local galleries, or simply enjoying a quiet moment in a sunlit park. Dress in layers; a light jacket would suffice this evening, but as the sun breaks free tomorrow, a simple t-shirt underneath will invite the warmth without the weight. Today beckons exploration and simple pleasures, where the fog recedes to reveal the enchanting city, serving as a perfect backdrop for tranquil activities away from the bustling crowds.",
