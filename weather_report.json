    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a clear, untroubled night. The sky is washed clean and quiet, stars stepping forward without a veil. Earlier, the sun had the stage to itself, unblinking and generous; shadows were knife\u2011edged and the UV would have felt insistent by midday. Now it has fallen to nothing, leaving a calm, glassy clarity in the air that makes the streets seem tidier and the trees more finely drawn.\n\nThe hours ahead promise the same open sky and a gentle ease into cooler comfort. It looks pleasant rather than sharp; a light layer or soft jumper will do if you slip outside. This is weather for modest rituals: a slow lap around the block, tending the balcony pots, or a quiet read by an open window while the night air drifts in. If you linger beneath the lamplight, you may notice how the moon paints the pavement and the town breathes a little slower.",
