    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a clean, unblemished sky, the sun already drawing quick, sharp shadows along the verandas. The morning feels dry and lucid, colors a little brighter than usual, and the day is set to stay this way: clear, bright, and untroubled by cloud. Under such open sunlight the UV will climb fast and hard by late morning into early afternoon, so the beauty comes with bite.\n\nWear light, breathable layers, a broad-brimmed hat, sunglasses with conviction, and sunscreen you don\u2019t skimp on; carry water and look for shade when the glare hardens. It\u2019s a good day to run small errands on foot before lunch, to let a basket of washing drink the sun, or to tend the garden briefly and then retreat. When the heat gathers, slip into a quiet bookshop or a cool gallery, or settle in a shaded caf\u00e9 courtyard and watch the bright street go about its business.",
