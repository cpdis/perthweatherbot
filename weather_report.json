    "weather_report": "As the sun gently retreats behind the hills, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a soothing embrace of partly cloudy skies, whispering promises of coolness after a long day. The temperature hovers around a mild 52 degrees, accentuated by a light west northwest wind that carries a hint of the ocean's brine, offering just enough chill to remind you of the city's coastal charm. Shadows stretch and dance across the streets as evening takes hold, creating an ambiance rich for contemplation or simply enjoying a leisurely stroll.\n\nLooking toward tomorrow, a shift is in the air. Rain is on the horizon, set to sweep in after five o'clock, likely beginning as a mere teasing drizzle before settling into a more persistent patter. With highs reaching just near 62, accompanied by increasing winds, the atmosphere carries both the thrill of change and the melancholy of a city preparing for the gentle embrace of autumn rains. If you venture out, consider layered clothing for comfort\u2014perhaps a soft sweater or jacket over your favorite long-sleeve shirt\u2014and don\u2019t forget an umbrella just in case. As the evening unfolds, a cozy caf\u00e9 visit could be the perfect retreat, where you can relax, sip your chosen comfort and watch the world stroll by, reveling in the tantalizing shift of seasons that San Francisco so gracefully orchestrates.",
