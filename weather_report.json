    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into night under a flawless dome of sky, the sort that makes the streetlights feel gentle and distant. It\u2019s clear now and expected to stay that way through late evening into the small hours, dry and calm, with the day\u2019s warmth easing toward something softer. Sunshine is done for the night; UV is essentially nil until morning. If these clear conditions carry into dawn, first light will arrive sharp and bright, and the UV will climb quickly with the season.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant night to move unhurriedly: a quiet lap around the block, a small errand, a lazy chat on the veranda. Dress in light layers you can shed or gather as the air cools\u2014comfortable clothes, perhaps a cardigan in hand. No need for sunscreen or brim now; set them by the door for tomorrow just in case. The evening is all clarity and calm, made for finishing a book, airing the house a little, or watering the garden while the heat has loosened its grip.",
