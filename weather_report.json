    "weather_report": "Frenchman Bay sits under a softened, pewter sky that began the day sealed in cloud and has since torn into ragged patches, letting shy light wander across the water. The sun is present but diffused, a gauze over the eyes rather than a glare; expect occasional bright spells but no hard, crystalline blue. UV exposure should be on the gentle side of moderate, the kind that warms the face without biting, and the day\u2019s clarity feels honest but subdued, distant headlands a touch faded at the edges.\n\nDress in light layers with a wind-stopping shell, something you can shrug off if a brighter interval finds you. Sunglasses won\u2019t be wasted when the clouds thin, but a hat is optional unless the breeze starts to fuss. It\u2019s a good afternoon for a slow shoreline amble, a visit to the small museum you keep meaning to see, mending a loose button by a window with a view of the tide, or leafing through a book on a bench while gulls stitch their own unruly patterns overhead. Keep plans unhurried and let the mottled sky set the tempo.",
