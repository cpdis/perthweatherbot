    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a flawless canopy, the noon sun hard and clean, shadows sharp as cutouts. The forecast stays clear through the afternoon into early evening, so expect a bright, high-glare day with UV running fierce now and only easing as the light tilts later on. The air feels summery and uncomplicated; the kind of clarity that makes colors pop and pavement shine.\n\nDress for lightness and protection: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses with real intent, and sunscreen you actually reapply. Keep water at hand. If you\u2019re out, choose the shady side of the street for errands or a slow lunch under an awning; save the unhurried wander through Kings Park or a gentle spin on the bike for later, when the sun softens and the heat releases its hold. Indoors, a quiet hour with the blinds half-drawn and a book will feel civilized; outdoors, this is a dry, bright window for hanging laundry or tending to small garden tasks before the late-afternoon glow arrives.",
