    "weather_report": "North Perth wakes under a soft, unsettled sky, the kind that hints at a brief, courteous shower late in the morning and then thinks better of it by early afternoon. Expect a light rinse followed by breaks of sun as the clouds separate into scattered islands. When the light returns it will be bright rather than fierce, but spring is sharpening; the UV will nudge into the moderate-to-high range when the sun slips between clouds. After the rain, the air should feel newly washed and the view a touch clearer down the street.\n\nDress in easy layers with a compact rain shell, and keep sunglasses handy for those shining intervals. Shoes that forgive puddles will make a short walk to a cafe, a spin through the grocer, or a library drop-off pleasantly simple, and the brightening midafternoon is kind to small chores on the balcony or a quiet loop through the local park. A dab of sunscreen or a brim won\u2019t go astray if you linger, as the sun has a habit of arriving right when you\u2019ve stopped paying attention.",
