    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil morning unfolds beneath a mostly clear sky, though remnants of the coastal marine layer linger nearby. With the day wearing on, a gentle warmth is beckoning, peeking out from behind the coolness of winter air. It's a serene 56 degrees now, destined to settle in the low 50s as the afternoon approaches, all while a light breeze whispers through the streets. The air is crisp and invigorating, perfect for a leisurely stroll down by the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s charming parks, where the sun gradually reveals its amber tones.\n\nAs the sun hangs low in the sky, a light jacket will serve well against the cool breeze, especially as evening falls and temperatures dip to around 45 degrees. Tonight promises clarity, ideal for evening reflections as the stars twinkle above the expansive backdrop of the Golden Gate. So, consider unwinding with a book at a cozy caf\u00e9 or meandering along the Embarcadero, where the soft glow of lanterns creates an inviting atmosphere. Today is perfect for savoring the quieter, often overlooked moments that San Francisco's charm offers.",
