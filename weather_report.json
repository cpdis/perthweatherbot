    "weather_report": "As the evening casts its gentle embrace over Subiaco, the sky maintains a cloak of pristine clarity, promising a serene night where the celestial parade may unfold unimpeded. Earlier today, a delicate wisp of clouds adorned the heavens, offering a subtle veil to the unrelenting sun, but now they've gracefully receded, leaving nothing but an expansive canvas of stars against an indigo backdrop. The sun's departure is your cue to reflect and unwind, its intensity having tempered, leaving only a whisper of warmth on the lingering breeze. This twilight hour beckons with an invitation to stroll through tranquil avenues, perhaps seeking solace in the rhythmic cadences of nature's quietude. Dress lightly but elegantly, allowing for the evening's soft caress as you venture out under the endless sky, which perfectly straddles the line between day and night. It's an ideal moment for a leisurely walk or for finding a quaint balcony to sip a comforting drink, watching as the city's lights twinkle into life, marking the passage of time in silken transition. Relish in the present silence, an exquisite balm to the day's endeavors, as Subiaco slips into the embrace of nightfall.",
