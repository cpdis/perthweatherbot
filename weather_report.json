    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Katy with a soft hiss, the streets still glistening from light rain that came through earlier in the day. The sun barely made an appearance, filtered and faint, leaving the UV quietly negligible and the day\u2019s colors muted to slate and silver. Now the sky hangs low and uniform, a damp hush in the air, headlights blurring at the edges. It isn\u2019t stormy so much as subdued, a gentle, lingering wet that makes the night feel slower and kind.\n\nExpect the mood to stay overcast with the chance of a stray sprinkle, the clarity softened rather than sharp. Dress for puddles and cool damp: a light waterproof shell or hooded sweater, breathable layers, comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind a curbside splash. This is good weather for small, unhurried tasks\u2014an easy grocery run, a quiet lap through the library stacks, tidying a drawer you\u2019ve ignored, or brewing something warm while music murmurs in the background. If you step out, let it be for the simple pleasure of the air after rain.",
