    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a gentle embrace of mostly sunny skies, offering a refreshing contrast to the day's earlier chill. The air remains crisp, and while the golden glow of sunlight bathes the city, there lies a lingering coolness, hinting at the brisk north-northwest winds that quietly push through the streets. As the sun rises higher, temperatures are expected to take a slight dip in the afternoon, teasing just below 56 degrees, so a light jacket or sweater might be the perfect companion for a midday stroll.\n\nEven as the day smiles, lingering patches of fog still drift near the coast, adding an ethereal quality to the view of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and the sprawling hills beyond. Tonight, the weather will settle into a quietly comforting partly cloudy night, where the air turns comfortably cool, inviting cozy indoor pursuits or a reflective evening walk along the waterfront to take in the serene bay. With such delightful conditions, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage, or perhaps a leisurely exploration of the city\u2019s hidden alleyways, would complement the tranquil ambiance of this charming San Francisco day.",
