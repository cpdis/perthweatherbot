    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a heavy quilt of gray clouds, laden with rain that punctuates the stillness. The high temperature whispers of 62 degrees, gradually descending to a cooler 60 by afternoon, while the brisk south-southeast winds carry a palpable chill. As the day progresses, the likelihood of rain remains firmly rooted at 70%, hinting at a steady drizzle that might transform into showers before the night settles in. The atmosphere seems thick, obscuring distant views and inviting the thick embrace of the marine layer that curls softly around the bridges and hills, blurring the lines of the familiar skyline.\n\nDressing wisely is essential for such a damp day; think layers, with a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear to navigate the puddles that are sure to form on the sidewalks. Since the rain is likely to continue into the evening, plans might best pivot towards the cozy indoors: perhaps explore one of San Francisco's tucked-away cafes, sipping warm beverages while watching the rhythms of city life through fogged windows. Alternatively, a visit to a local gallery or museum could provide a splendid escape from the dreariness outdoors, offering both warmth and a feast for the senses amid the persistent rain.",
