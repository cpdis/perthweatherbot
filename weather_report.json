    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night air is imbued with a calm clarity, accented by a low temperature that hovers around the serene 49 degrees. The north winds, gentle yet persistent, bring a crispness to the atmosphere, whispering through the city streets like a quiet conversation among friends. As dawn approaches, it promises a day of jubilant sunshine, though the temperatures will only flirt with the mid-sixties before gracefully retreating to a more modest setting in the afternoon. The north-northeast winds will continue to dance at a lively pace, occasionally gusting with a hint of chaos, stirring the air just enough to remind us of the ocean's close embrace.\n\nWith the promise of sunshine, the morning unfolds with a pleasant invitation to explore the streets. Nonetheless, the lingering marine layer may hover over the bay, reminding one of the city's ever-contrasting moods. Dressing in layers becomes essential; a light jacket paired with a simple tee will navigate the morning chill while preparing for the warmth that the sun promises to generously share. The day beckons for a leisurely stroll through the parks or perhaps a visit to one of the numerous cafes, where one might enjoy a cup of steaming coffee while soaking in the urban ambiance, listening to the tranquil bustle of a city that thrives on transitions.",
