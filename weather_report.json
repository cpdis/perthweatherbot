    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past two in the gentle embrace of a Subiaco night, the heavens stretch wide, a vast canvas of azure clarity. The forecast speaks of a perfect day ahead, a symphony of sunbeams dancing upon the earth with an unyielding brightness. Subiaco\u2019s morning promises to unravel with a spectacle of clarity, whispers of clear skies painting the world with a palette of vibrant blue hues. The sun, our reliable companion in the sky, prepares to rise dramatically, casting its radiant glow and warming the soul of the city. It's a day that invites you to bask in its brilliance, a day where the sunshine kisses your cheeks like an old friend you haven't seen in ages.\n\nAs you step out, consider clothing that is both cool and shaded, perhaps an understated floppy hat or a lightweight shawl that flutters with the breeze while warding off the sun\u2019s exuberance. It\u2019s an opportune time to embrace simplicity, to wander through the park with a faint smile drawn by dappled sunlight on the path, or to sit serenely by a window, with a novel in hand and a cold drink within reach. The day hints at ease and leisure, a gentle reminder to relish life\u2019s simple joys. Thus, let the optimistic clarity guide your plans, whether that means a peaceful interlude on a garden bench listening to birds converse or a leisurely stroll along shaded avenues.",
