    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the sky is clean and quiet, a deep, steady blue with the first hint of pale light gathering on the edge. The air feels cool against the skin and the forecast stays simple: a clear morning yielding to bright, unfiltered sunshine. Expect a high degree of clarity and little haze; by late morning the sun will bite, with the UV rising quickly into the caution zone, so treat it with respect.\n\nIt looks like a pleasing day if you time it well: a light layer for the early chill, then breathable clothes, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and sunscreen for the late morning onward. Consider an early walk for coffee while the streets are gentle, hang the washing to take advantage of that honest sun, or ride over to pick up groceries before the glare hardens. By midmorning, errands on the shady side of the street or a quiet read on a verandah will suit the mood; the day promises uncomplicated blue and a clear view of things.",
