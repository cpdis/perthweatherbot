    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the skies are clear, offering a tranquil backdrop for a chilly evening as temperatures dip into the lower 50s. The subtle east-northeast wind, gentle at about 5 to 9 mph, carries with it a whisper of colder air, hinting at the fresh, crispness of the coastal ambiance. As the city\u2019s lights flicker and soften against the backdrop of a darkening sky, one might find a moment of peace in the stillness, perhaps enjoying a quiet stroll along the waterfront, where the reflections of the illuminated skyline dance upon the bay's gentle waves.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the city greets the morning with sunshine, promising a delightful day. The high will hover around a mild 60, cooling to about 55 as the afternoon unfolds. The north wind may stir up to 16 mph, but it will be refreshing rather than biting, perfect for outdoor activities. One might consider donning a light jacket or sweater, comfortable shoes for exploration, and perhaps a colorful scarf to add a splash of charm to the pristine day. With the clear skies, it would be an excellent opportunity to visit local cafes, partake in a leisurely bike ride through Golden Gate Park, or simply savor a book in a sun-drenched corner of Union Square, as the city continues to unfold its beauty.",
