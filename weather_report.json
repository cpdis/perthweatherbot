    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon is cloaked in a signature shroud of misty gray, reminiscent of the city\u2019s ethereal charm. With a chance of rain looming after four, the air carries an expectant coolness, settled around a high near 56, which will gradually dip to the mid-50s as the sun wanes behind a veiled horizon. The south-southwest wind whispers through the streets, a gentle prelude to the more robust gusts that are predicted to accompany the evening downpour. As the clouds thicken, it feels as though a soft blanket is being draped over the bustling urban landscape, hinting at the moisture to come.\n\nTonight, the city will bathe in sheets of rain, with the temperature rising slightly, almost contrarily, to around 57 under an increasingly darkened sky. With a 90% chance of precipitation, the evening promises to be intimately soaked, the rhythm of rainfall creating a serenade against windowpanes. For those venturing out, a waterproof jacket is essential, complemented by layers to ward off the chill that hugs the damp air. This is the kind of evening perfect for curling up in a cozy caf\u00e9 with a book or catching a low-key live music performance beneath an awning somewhere, where the sound of rain can mingle with the warm glow of conversation. The city, as it often does, offers a uniquely tranquil refuge in such weather, inviting those who embrace its moody beauty to find solace amidst the storm.",
