    "weather_report": "Perth is bathed in warm, golden light as another day finds itself graced by clear skies. The sun is like an enthused artist, splashing vibrant hues across the vast canopy above. The current moment slips into the past, carrying with it a gentle breeze that nudges the day towards the noon mark. As the time tickles 14:12, the ethereal silence is filled with a profound clarity - a testament to the subtle charm that only a sunny day in March can lend Perth. \n\nToday, the weather's artistry is quietly extraordinary, and one may find oneself instilled with an irresistible yearning for a casual trot around the park or a leisurely drive along the coast. A shirt of linen or cotton might suffice, coupled with sunglasses, to comfortably absorb the sun's glowing tribute to the day. As the day wanes, consider inviting the evening with a warm cup of tea on the patio, the setting sun cradling the city in its broad arms. Such is the delight of a clear day; it is nature's sonnet, sung under the brilliant azure stage.",
