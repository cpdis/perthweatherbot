    "weather_report": "As morning stretches over Downtown San Francisco, the city wakes beneath a radiant sun, brightening the skyline and casting gentle warmth across the streets. With temperatures hovering near a comfortable 60 degrees, the northeast winds stir lightly, offering a refreshing caress that complements the clear skies. This is a morning that beckons one to embrace the invigorating air, unmarred by the usual fog that can envelop the Bay. Instead, the vistas reveal a crisp clarity, showcasing the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the warmth to gradually dip to the mid-50s, a subtle reminder of the coastal chill that whispers through the city. Tonight promises to be equally serene, with mostly clear skies and lows around 45, accompanied by a gentle breeze from the south. Dressing in layers would be wise; a light jacket over a comfortable shirt will serve well for those venturing out, while a scarf might come in handy as evening approaches. With such inviting conditions, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the tranquility of the bay meets the subtle hum of urban life\u2014perhaps a stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 to watch the world float by, or a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s lush parks, sipping something warm as you soak in the tranquil beauty of the day.",
