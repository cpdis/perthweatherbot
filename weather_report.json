    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a sharp chill that is amplified by the promise of rain set to drench the city. A canopy of clouds looms overhead, thickening into a shroud that mutters of impending showers, with the mercury settling around 51 degrees. The whisper of a southeast wind weaves through the streets, stirring up a murmur of anticipation among those who find themselves outside. With a high probability of precipitation tomorrow, and whispers of light rain, one can expect the city\u2019s fog to roll in, wrapping its tendrils around familiar landmarks, further muffling the already muted city sounds.\n\nDressed for the dampness, layers of warmth are essential. A sturdy coat, perhaps a waterproof jacket, paired with comfortable footwear would serve you well as you navigate the slick pavement. Tonight is best suited for quiet introspection as the raindrops tap like a gentle drummer on windowpanes. Consider retreating to a cozy caf\u00e9, immersing yourself in a good book while the rain creates a tapestry of sound outside. A leisurely evening with a warm beverage captures the very essence of this San Francisco winter night, as golden lights from the city bleed softly into the wet streets, promising another day steeped in the allure of the persistent rain.",
