    "weather_report": "A gentle blanket of fog hovers persistently over Downtown San Francisco, lending the city an air of mystery as it drapes its silvery veil across the familiar architecture. As dawn breaks, the patched fog begins its slow retreat, promising a day where sunlight will manage to pierce through the clouds, though under a muted embrace. With temperatures falling towards the mid-fifties, a brisk chill settles in the morning air, hinting at the need for a light sweater or jacket as one prepares to step outside.\n\nBy midday, the fog will further dissipate, allowing the sun to cast its warm glow upon the streets, though a lingering haze may temper that warmth slightly. The north-northwest breeze will add a refreshing touch, ensuring that the landscape remains vibrant but comfortably cool. Today invites leisurely walks through the fog-charmed streets; perhaps a meander through a nearby park or a late afternoon visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where one can enjoy a warm drink while watching the interplay of light and shadow dance upon the city. Embracing an attire layered enough to adapt to the day\u2019s changing moods will make for a truly pleasant experience in San Francisco\u2019s ever-evolving tableau.",
