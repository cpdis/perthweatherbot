    "weather_report": "As the moonlight lingers softly over Downtown San Francisco, you find yourself wrapped in a gentle chill typical of this time of year. The night sky is shrouded in clouds, hinting at the rain to come, yet the air carries a warmth, as if the melting frost of winter is yet to fully assert its grip on the city. You might notice the faintest shimmer of moisture settled delicately on the streets below, a prelude to the wetness that might grace the day ahead.\n\nTomorrow unfurls with more clouds than sunlight, carrying a promise of rain which could arrive gently, like a sigh from the heavens. Daylight may be dreary, yet there\u2019s a certain beauty in the muted tones that will descend upon the city. With temperatures hovering around the mid-fifties, it\u2019s wise to don layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater underneath a waterproof jacket, ready for the unexpected puddles that will gather. A gentle breeze will whisper through the streets, but it\u2019s unlikely to trouble your stroll if you\u2019re wrapped warmly. \n\nConsider a quiet day spent drifting through an art gallery or savoring a steamy cup of coffee in a nook of your favorite caf\u00e9, watching the city embrace the rain. The flickering streetlights will create a dreamy ambiance, inviting introspective moments and perhaps a chance to lose yourself in a book, accompanied by the rhythmic sound of raindrops pattering against the window. Seek solace in the simple pleasures offered by this wet yet tranquil day, as San Francisco dons a veil of clouds and contemplation.",
