    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a serene clarity blankets the city, transforming familiar outlines into soft silhouettes against the darkening sky. A gentle northeast wind stirs at about five miles per hour, ushering in the absence of fog, allowing the lights to shimmer with an inviting glow. The temperature hovers around 51 degrees, with an ascent to 53 anticipated as the hours drift towards dawn. The lack of any significant marine layer adds to the night\u2019s allure, making it an ideal moment for a reflective stroll, wrapped in a light jacket to ward off the evening chill.\n\nTomorrow promises sunshine with all the warmth of late autumn, calling for high spirits and a stroll through the city\u2019s storied streets. Expect a high near 67 and an afternoon cooling to around 62, perfect for enjoying a latte at an outdoor caf\u00e9, perhaps a leisurely walk across the vibrant Embarcadero. As daylight unfolds, the gentle caress of the northeast wind will encourage wanderers to shed layers in favor of cozy comfort. Embrace the day with a sense of adventure found in the mundane; a simple visit to a local bookstore or a peaceful moment in a neighborhood park may align perfectly with the region's tranquil charm.",
