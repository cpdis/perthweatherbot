    "weather_report": "Late afternoon settles over Centennial Park with a soft, pewter sky that never quite opens. The morning\u2019s light rain has rinsed the air, leaving a faint petrichor in the paths and a darker sheen to the lawns. Sunshine is mostly a rumor today, filtered and subdued, and the UV will stay gentle; shadows are dull-edged and the light is calm, almost contemplative. Visibility is steady but the world looks slightly muted, as if viewed through a clean pane of smoked glass.\n\nExpect the overcast to linger into the evening, cool and a touch damp underfoot. A light waterproof or a comfortable sweater suits the hour, with shoes that don\u2019t mind the occasional puddle. It\u2019s good weather for an unhurried loop around the pond, a quiet bench with a book, or a few photos that lean into the park\u2019s silvery tones. If you\u2019re feeling restless, an easy jog or a thoughtful dog walk will match the mood; if not, fetch a warm drink and let the subdued day do its unshowy work.",
