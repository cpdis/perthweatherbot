    "weather_report": "Perth slips into early afternoon beneath a quilt of cloud that tears and mends, letting through generous splashes of sun. It feels warm whenever the light breaks free, the air clear enough to sketch the distant rooftops in fine lines. Expect intervals rather than a blaze of uninterrupted blue, and treat the UV with respect; even with cloud about, it still bites at this hour.\n\nThrough the rest of the day the cloud should be patchy and mobile, tending toward wider blue later on, pleasant for simple errands and an unhurried lunch under an awning. Dress in light, breathable layers with sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen, the sort of kit that lets you move easily between sun and shade. Consider a quiet wander to the library, a stop at a local shop, or a short riverfront stroll where you can duck beneath trees when the light sharpens; back home, tending balcony plants or airing out a room would suit the tempered brightness.",
