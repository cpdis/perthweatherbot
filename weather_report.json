    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean, unblemished sky, the morning light crisp and steady with that glassy clarity that sharpens edges and floods rooms. Forecasts keep the canvas clear through late morning and into the early afternoon, so anticipate generous sunshine, high visibility, and a bright glare off windshields and windows. The UV will climb quickly toward midday; it\u2019s a day for shade when you can find it, and for remembering that the sun has a longer reach than it seems.\n\nDress for ease and light: breathable layers, a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen; carry a small bottle of water if you\u2019re out and about. It looks like a pleasant day to run a few errands on foot before lunch, sit under a caf\u00e9 awning with a book, water the balcony plants, or wheel a quiet bike ride to the post office. If work calls, open the windows and let the clear day keep you company; if not, take a short, unhurried walk and let the blue overhead set the pace.",
