    "weather_report": "Perth settles into a clear, open night, the sky polished to a deep navy with stars pricked sharp as pins. The air feels steady and uncomplicated, the kind of stillness that makes streetlights glow a little farther and footsteps sound softer. UV is negligible now, and the clarity is excellent, all clean edges and quiet horizons; it\u2019s a pleasant, unhurried evening.\n\nForecasts keep the heavens cloudless through late night, so expect dawn to break bright and uncomplicated, with sunshine quickly turning confident after first light. UV will ramp up fast once the day wakes, so plan for shade, sunscreen, a hat, and clear lenses when you head out. For now, a light layer is enough if you wander the block or sit on the verandah with a book; set out tomorrow\u2019s bag, water the herbs, let the house breathe. If you\u2019re up early, a short errand or ride before the sun sharpens will feel easy and kind.",
