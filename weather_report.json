    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city seems to wake to a symphony of rain. Thick, heavy clouds drape the skyline like a velvet curtain, threatening more showers throughout the day. The air carries an unmistakable dampness, laced with the promise of thunderstorms. With temperatures hovering around the chilly mid-fifties, it is a day that calls for sturdy rain boots and a well-fitted raincoat to combat both the wet chill and the relentless wind. Sweaters beneath the outer layer would add a comforting buffer against the brisk gusts that could reach near 37 mph, a reminder of nature's unpredictable temperament.\n\nAs the rain falls persistently until late afternoon, the chances of a fleeting break in showers are dim, with the forecasted precipitations hinting at up to two inches. While some may find today less than idyllic for grand outings, perhaps a cozy afternoon spent leaning into the rhythm of the rain with a good book at a local caf\u00e9 or a visit to the bustling indoor spaces of the Ferry Building could prove to be the perfect remedy. In the evening, the promise of clearer skies could encourage a gentle stroll along the waterfront, where puddles still reflect the last glimmers of sunlight before night descends, revealing the enchanting dance of city lights reflecting in the aftermath of the storm.",
