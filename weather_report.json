    "weather_report": "Subiaco slid from a clean, sunlit afternoon into a gently cloud-dappled evening, the sky still mostly open and calm. Earlier, the sun had real bite and the UV ran on the strong side; now it has eased to almost nothing, leaving a clear, dry clarity to the air and a sense of order settling over the streets. The night looks steady and pleasant, with only a few clouds drifting through and long spells of starlight between them.\n\nYou\u2019ll want a light layer or a soft cardigan for comfort, and shoes made for an unhurried stroll. It\u2019s a good night for the ordinary rituals: a leisurely walk to shake off the day, a quiet bench to finish a chapter, a simple supper carried home through the mild air, or a tidy-up by an open window while the sky deepens. Expect the weather to stay cooperative, serene rather than showy.",
