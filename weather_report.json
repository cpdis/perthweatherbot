    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth envelops the city, where sunshine mingles with playful patches of cloud. The temperature flirts near 61, yet a soft, cool breath from the west nudges it downward, promising a crisp, refreshing embrace reminiscent of the nearby waters. Looking toward the Golden Gate, a delicate veil of fog flirts along the horizon, hinting at the marine layer that often rolls in with the evening tide, although much of the city remains bright and clear, inviting exploratory ventures.\n\nAs dusk begins to settle, the clouds will gather more resolutely, ushering in a low of around 50. For those venturing outdoors, a light jacket layered over a comfortable sweater would be wise\u2014a nod to the shifting winds that accompany the changing light. The late afternoon is an excellent time for a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the waterfront comes alive with the promise of the evening. Perhaps pause at a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, watching as the city transitions from its vibrant hustle to a quieter night under the canopy of stars, enhanced by the muted glow of the skyline reflecting off the bay.",
