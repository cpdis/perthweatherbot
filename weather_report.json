    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds hangs low, casting a subdued light upon the streets, hinting at the impending rain that will wash over the city later in the evening. The temperature hovers around a cool 62 degrees, with a gentle breeze whispering in from the southeast, occasionally teasing the edges of the clouds. As afternoon drapes itself across the skyline, a slight chance of rain looms, though the air remains thick with a tranquil moisture, foretelling the heavier downpours that will settle in tonight. \n\nWhile the Golden Gate nestles in a shroud of fog, the city itself is marked by a veil of soft gray, offering a mystique that might inspire a reflective stroll. It would be prudent to dress warmly, perhaps with a light jacket and a scarf, welcoming the cool air while preparing for the rain's arrival. As evening approaches, the allure of cozy corners in local caf\u00e9s beckons\u2014perfect for enjoying a warm drink while watching droplets paint the windows. An umbrella might serve as a faithful companion on this gentle, reflective day, inviting you to explore the quieter sides of the city\u2014or perhaps find solace indoors as the rain begins to mingle with the sounds of bustling life just outside.",
