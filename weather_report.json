    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco feels muted and silvery, the sun hiding behind a quilt of cloud that thickens toward early afternoon. Light showers are likely to shuffle through after lunch, beading the pavements before easing into broken cloud late in the day, when a few weak shafts might slip through. Even with the veil overhead, the spring UV still has a bite at this hour, so treat the light with respect.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for ease and small comforts: a breathable shirt with a light jacket tucked in your bag, shoes that don\u2019t mind a sprinkle, and a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out between errands. The weather leans gentle rather than grim; the rain looks brief, the air clear enough for a short, reflective walk once it passes, perhaps a detour for coffee by a window while the street glosses over. Later, as the clouds loosen, it could be a good time to browse a bookshop, pick up groceries without rushing, or tend to small tasks at home with the radio low and the afternoon drifting toward a softer evening.",
