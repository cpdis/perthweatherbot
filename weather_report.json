    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a clean, moonwashed sky and the kind of quiet that sharpens edges; the air feels mild drifting toward cool, and the stars look newly minted. The forecast holds clear through late night into the small hours, so expect a dry, steady calm with excellent visibility. Sun is off the stage now, so UV has slipped to negligible; if this glassy pattern survives into morning, it will turn bright in a hurry after sunrise.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of night for an unhurried lap around the block, picking up a forgotten loaf, or finishing a chapter on the balcony while the breeze threads the leaves. Dress for a gentle cool-down: a light jumper or soft jacket, comfortable shoes, maybe a scarf if you plan to linger. Water the garden, walk the dog a little farther than usual, or simply stand still and let the sky do its quiet work; then, set out sunscreen by the door as a nod to what a clear dawn usually brings.",
