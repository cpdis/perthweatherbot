    "weather_report": "The afternoon sky over Subiaco wears a delicate shroud of lingering clouds, veiled lightly by the aftermath of an earlier drizzle, leaving pavements glazed and trees rejuvenated. The sun offers only subtle glimpses between shifting clouds, muting its rays softly across buildings and streets, bestowing upon the neighborhood an air of gentle tranquility. One would find the atmosphere pleasant enough for a stroll, yet suitably moody to merit contemplation beneath a covered patio or on a porch swing, sipping tea or browsing through pages of a book worn familiar by repeated reading.\n\nA sensible choice today would be a lightweight jacket or soft sweater to counteract the lingering dampness in the air, blending practicality with understated elegance. Indoors or under shelter would perhaps best fit the mood of this serene and introspective afternoon, though a short journey to a quiet caf\u00e9 or a corner bakery seems equally fitting, where one may indulge in savory pastry and the simple pleasure of idle observation, watching as others pass serenely through the softened day, wrapped in gentle shades of early spring melancholia.",
