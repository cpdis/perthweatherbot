    "weather_report": "West Perth slips into a clean-lined night, the sky polished to a deep blue-black with nothing but the hush of late traffic and a few crickets to disturb it. The forecast stays crystal clear through late evening and into the small hours, so expect stars to hold their ground. There\u2019s no sun at this hour and the UV index is essentially nil; the air reads as honest and uncomplicated, the kind that lets distant lights look nearer than they are.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant night to keep it simple: short sleeves will do for most, with a light layer in your pocket if you linger past midnight. An unhurried walk, a quiet stretch on the balcony, or finishing that chapter by an open window would suit the mood. If this streak of clarity carries into dawn, expect a bright start and a quick climb in glare; plan for shade, a hat, and sunscreen if you\u2019re out later in the morning. Early risers might steal a calm coffee outside before the day sharpens.",
