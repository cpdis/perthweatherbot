    "weather_report": "As the day wanes in Subiaco, the sky reflects a lingering sense of melancholy with departing rain clouds casting a muted gray across the horizon. The moderate showers that graced the afternoon have softened to a gentle drizzle, adding a shimmering gloss to the leaves and pavements. With the sun having already dipped below the skyline, the UV index gracefully bows out of the conversation, leaving the air light and mild. While the rain holds sway over the day, bringing a refreshing coolness, it also accompanies a quiet in the air, the world wrapped up in the rhythm of raindrops. The evening air asks for a light jacket, something soft and comfortably worn, whispering against the skin like an old friend. It's a night to find solace indoors, perhaps sipping on a steaming cup of tea while nestled in your favorite armchair, the gentle sound of rain a soothing symphony outside your window. Venture out only if you must, for the day is slipping off to sleep, and with it, casting a cloak of temperate humidity that's more about contemplation than conversation.",
