    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a clear sky at this late hour, the day having worn a hard, polished blue from start to finish. Sunshine was abundant and incisive, the sort that nips at unprotected skin by midafternoon, but with night the UV slips to nothing and the air turns lucid and still. There\u2019s no haze, no fuss\u2014just a clean, uncomplicated dome overhead and streetlights softened at the edges.\n\nExpect the rest of the night to stay cloudless and calm. Dress lightly in breathable fabrics, perhaps a soft layer if you plan to linger outdoors. It\u2019s a good night for small, ordinary rituals: bring in the washing, water the balcony pots, take a quiet loop around the block, or sit on the veranda with a page-turner while the house exhales. When the sun returns, it will feel frank and bright again, so tomorrow\u2019s errands will want sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen; for now, enjoy the gentle hush.",
