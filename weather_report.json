    "weather_report": "As the day wanes into the embrace of evening, Subiaco is painted beneath a sky as clear as a polished glass, allowing the residual warmth of the afternoon sun to linger in the air. While the sun is slowly stepping back to let the night take its turn, there is no fiery glow or fierce UV rays to contest with, leaving the atmosphere gentle and unyieldingly crisp. Yet, beneath this tranquil canopy, the May air carries a subtle chill, urging evening wanderers to don something cozy and soothing, perhaps a light sweater or a snug scarf without forsaking style. In these concluding hours, every breath of air feels like a deep, calming exhale from the week\u2019s hustle, coaxing locals and visitors alike to saunter through tree-lined paths or relax on a welcoming terrace of a cafe, warming a cup of tea between their fingers. It\u2019s a golden hour of sorts, best spent in quiet reflection with a book whose pages whisper gently against the backdrop of a fading day, or strolling hand in hand with thoughts or companions, each step echoing the placid harmony of a flawless, serene sky above.",
