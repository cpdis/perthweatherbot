    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco arrives under a quilt of broken cloud, the kind that turns the first light into a soft wash rather than a glare. Expect a morning of dappled sunshine as gaps open and close overhead; the air should feel calm and forgiving, with visibility clear but the edges of the day gently smudged by cloud. UV is negligible at this hour, then likely rises through late morning when the sun finds those breaks\u2014enough to warrant a hat and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out around midday.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant, unhurried start: not dazzling, not dour\u2014just quietly bright. Dress in easy layers, a light shirt with a cardigan or thin jacket you can peel off when the light strengthens, and carry sunglasses for the patchy glare. Good conditions for ordinary joys: a slow walk to fetch bread, a lap around the block on the bike while the streets are still hushed, watering the herbs, or settling by a caf\u00e9 window to read and watch the sky decide how much sun it wants to show.",
