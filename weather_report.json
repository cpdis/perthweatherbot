    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a promise of rain. The sky is heavily cloaked in cloud, hinting at a somnolent blanket of gray that may tease the inhabitants with occasional droplets. The temperature is lingering around a cool 50 degrees, nudging gently towards 52, while a gentle south-southeast breeze whispers at around 10 miles per hour, stirring the leaves with a hushed urgency. Visibility is moderate; the marine layer is present, wrapping the city in a subtle shroud that blurs the edges of the Golden Gate Bridge and softens the outlines of the skyline. \n\nAs the day progresses, the forecast suggests a high that hovers near 59, accompanied by a persistent chance of rain. This kind of weather invites layers. A warm, light jacket paired with a comfortable scarf would suit the scene well, as temperatures are likely to dip as the afternoon approaches, with a slight chill settling in. It would be a lovely day to wander through the less-traveled streets of the city, seeking out cozy caf\u00e9s for warmth, or perhaps exploring the nooks of local bookstores, with the rhythmic patter of rain offering a backdrop to a peaceful escape from the bustling world outside. Opting for the indoors not only embraces the spirit of the day but also allows one to savor the cozy ambiance of the city, revealing its charms hidden by the clouds.",
