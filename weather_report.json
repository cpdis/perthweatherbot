    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds drapes the city, casting a soft, muted light that gives the atmosphere a tranquil hush. The air is cool, with temperatures lingering near the high 50s, while a gentle west-southwest breeze stirs leaves and whispers through the quiet streets. The hint of moisture in the air foreshadows the possibility of light rain later, as the clouds seem to gather in anticipation, their gray hues an invitation for a cozy afternoon indoors.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the temperature may rise slightly, caressing the 56-degree mark, but there\u2019s a palpable chill hinting at night\u2019s embrace. A chance of rain looms on the horizon, with the likelihood growing after eleven o'clock; a subtle reminder of the season's mercurial nature. For those venturing out, a light jacket or a layered sweater paired with comfortable shoes will offer warmth without sacrificing freedom of movement. The weather encourages simple pleasures: perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the sound of gentle waves accompanies reflections of a city draped in soft grays, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 where one might savor a warm drink while watching the world drift by through foggy windows.",
