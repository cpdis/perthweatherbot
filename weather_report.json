    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a polished, cloudless night. The sky is open and steady now and through the late hours, with stars pricked clean against a dark, uncomplicated canvas. The sun is long gone, and with it the glare; UV is negligible, replaced by a calm, temperate quiet that feels gently pleasant rather than bracing.\n\nDress for ease: a light layer or soft cardigan if you\u2019re lingering outdoors, long sleeves if you\u2019re rolling home on a bike. With the air this clear, it\u2019s a good time for a slow loop around the block, a quick walk to the corner shop, or a few unrushed pages on the veranda with the windows ajar. Let the rooms breathe, water the herbs, give the dog a last, thoughtful wander, and enjoy the simple luxury of a night that asks very little.",
