    "weather_report": "As dawn begins to paint the sky in hues of soft blue and gold, Downtown San Francisco awakens to a serenely clear night. With temperatures resting comfortably around 52 degrees, the crisp air carries a gentle northwest breeze, rustling through the leaves and sending a refreshing shiver through the streets. The high tomorrow floats just shy of 68, promising a splendid day as the sun ascends further into the sky, its warmth gradually enveloping the city. For now, the night remains tranquil, with no sign of the fog that often drapes itself over the hills\u2014only the stark clarity of the stars twinkling above, mingling with the distant shimmer of city lights.\n\nAs the sun rises, those wandering the lively neighborhoods may find the North wind brisk, its playful gusts reminding one to dress in layers\u2014a lightweight sweater over a shirt, perhaps, for those early hours. As the day unfolds and temperatures drift gently down to around 63, a simple cardigan may suffice for an afternoon stroll. There\u2019s an inviting calm in the air, making it a perfect moment for a quiet walk along the Embarcadero, where one might sip coffee and savior the serene beauty of the Bay. Alternatively, a leisurely visit to one of the charming local caf\u00e9s could provide a delightful escape, as the city breathes in harmony with its surroundings on this beautiful Sunday.",
