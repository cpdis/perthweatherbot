    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Mascot, the air feels mild and a touch sticky, the sky pressed low with cloud that turns streetlights into soft halos. It\u2019s a muted, velvety night with visibility gently smudged, and by daybreak light rain moves through, keeping the horizon hazy and the sun mostly behind curtains. Expect a dim, pewter morning; sunshine will be scarce at first, with the UV staying low at dawn and only edging up later if the cloud fissures for a spell.\n\nPlan for an unhurried start. A light, breathable layer under a thin rain jacket, closed shoes with some grip, and a small umbrella will suit the early showers. The day looks gently unpleasant in that summery, damp way\u2014more languid than harsh\u2014good for a quiet tram ride to a window seat and a coffee, a library visit, a short grocery run between sprinkles, or tidying a project you can finish before lunch. If you\u2019re walking or cycling early, keep it easy and let the drizzle set the tempo; check the sky late morning to see if it softens enough for a quick errand in brighter light.",
