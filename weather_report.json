    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives with a clean, confident light; the sky feels open and steady now and should stay bright through the afternoon, with only a few shy clouds wandering in toward evening. Visibility looks crisp and generous, the kind of clear day that sharpens edges and invites a lingering glance upward. The sun has some bite to it, and the UV will be strong through the early afternoon before softening later, so dress in breathable layers with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen, and keep water at hand. It\u2019s pleasant if you give it shade: a quick walk to run an errand, lunch on a verandah under an awning, a load of washing that will dry in no time, or a simple circuit of the quieter streets as the light mellows and the day exhales.",
