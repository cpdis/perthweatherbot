    "weather_report": "Midday in Shenton Park arrives under a hard, polished blue, the morning\u2019s stray clouds long burned away. Light is sharp and generous, shadows trimmed; the air feels dry and clean with a far horizon. Expect a broadly sunny, uncomplicated afternoon, perhaps a modest breeze later, but mostly a day ruled by glare. The sun carries some bite now and the UV is unforgiving through early afternoon, so time outside is best measured rather than lingering.\n\nIt\u2019s pleasant if you keep a respectful distance from the rays: a brimmed hat, sunglasses, light long sleeves, sunscreen, and a bottle of water will make it an easy day. Take a quiet walk between trees, run a couple of errands in the shade, peg laundry to the line and let the sky do the work, or slide into a caf\u00e9 window seat and watch the bright world pass. Save the longer stretch of the legs for late afternoon, when the light softens and the heat loses its edge.",
