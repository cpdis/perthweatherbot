    "weather_report": "Midday at Centennial Park arrives with the hush that follows a light morning rain. Paths are damp, leaves lacquered, and the sky keeps to a uniform pewter sheet that turns the sun into a pale suggestion. Any brightness today will be brief and filtered; the UV sits subdued beneath the overcast, more a gentle nudge than a sting. The air is clean and a touch humid, visibility good though distance looks softly smudged, like a view through linen.\n\nThrough the afternoon, expect a mostly gray, calm day with the possibility of another passing sprinkle and, if fortune tilts your way, a shy break in the clouds. A light waterproof shell and shoes that don\u2019t mind wet grass are wiser than heavy layers; tuck a compact umbrella in a pocket. It\u2019s a day for an unhurried loop along the paths, a stretch under a pavilion, or a quietly triumphant chapter on a sheltered bench; if the ceiling thins, a brief photo walk to catch reflections in puddles will reward you. A dab of sunscreen won\u2019t hurt, but you can leave the big sunhat at home.",
