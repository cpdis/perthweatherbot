    "weather_report": "Osborne Park wakes to a polished blue canopy, the kind of lucid morning that makes edges sharp and colors honest. By midmorning the sun already has some steel in it, and the day is set to stay cloudless and bright through the early afternoon, a clean sweep of light with excellent visibility and almost no haze. It will feel cheerful and uncomplicated, though the glare grows a little unforgiving around midday and the UV will run very high under this midsummer sky.\n\nDress for lightness: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses that earn their keep, and sunscreen you actually reapply. Carry water and move the brisk errands to now, before the sun leans hard on the pavements. It\u2019s a good morning to hang a wash and let it crisp in the breeze, to slip out for a shaded coffee, or to take a short, purposeful walk beneath the taller trees. If you\u2019re working from home, keep the blinds drawn just enough to cool the room while the blue day hums beyond the glass; step out again closer to late afternoon when the light softens and the streets exhale.",
