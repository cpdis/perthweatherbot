    "weather_report": "Denmark wakes under a soft, silver sky, streets still beaded from the morning\u2019s light rain and the air smelling faintly of wet stone. Showers brushed through around dawn and may linger in patches through late morning, keeping the sun shy and the day gently dim; if breaks come, they\u2019ll be brief and muted. UV will stay low, the kind that barely nudges the skin even at midday. It\u2019s a cool, contemplative kind of day: clarity is subdued, edges softened, horizons a watercolor of slate and blue. A light rain jacket and comfortable shoes will serve you well, with a warm layer beneath for those unhurried pauses at crossings and bus stops. Consider small, steady pleasures\u2014an errand loop with an umbrella in hand, a quiet coffee by the window, a slow walk to the library between showers, or a lunchtime browse in a shop while the pavements glisten and the clouds rearrange themselves.",
