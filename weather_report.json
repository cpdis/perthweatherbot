    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is drifting into a quiet evening, the skies offering a gentle response to the cool air settling in, with temperatures dipping to a brisk 49 degrees. As you step outside, the lingering clarity of the day provides a calm backdrop, illuminated by the soft glow of the city lights reflecting off the bay. The breeze, though barely perceptible, carries hints of chill from the ocean, reminding us of the natural rhythm of the city.\n\nAs Friday dawns with promise, the forecast paints a picture of sunny optimism, where the temperature will rise steadily toward a mild 62. The morning sun will break against the remnants of the evening cool, encouraging a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a leisurely coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9. It's wise to layer your attire; a light jacket or sweater will give you comfort against the cool morning air, while allowing an easy transition into the warmth of mid-morning. For those with the luxury of time, a quiet walk through the park or a visit to a local gallery could satisfy the soul, making the most of this crisp yet inviting San Francisco day.",
