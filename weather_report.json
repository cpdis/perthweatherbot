    "weather_report": "Denmark wakes to streets still a little silver from the night\u2019s light rain, the sky now a quilt of broken cloud letting through shy seams of brightness. The air feels rinsed and steady, with a gentle clarity that makes church spires and harbor cranes seem just a touch nearer. Sun will be hesitant rather than bold, and the UV stays low for an October morning, more a soft glow than a sting.\n\nThrough the day expect that same mixed canvas: mostly dry, with cloud pulling apart at times to offer brief, useful light. It looks quietly pleasant if you dress for the cool\u2014layers, a light jacket, maybe a scarf for the breeze, and shoes that don\u2019t mind a damp pavement. It\u2019s a good day for modest errands by bicycle, a mid-morning coffee by a window, or a deliberate walk to the market while the sky negotiates with the sun. If you\u2019re staying in, crack a window, sort a shelf, tune the kettle; if you\u2019re out, aim for the brighter spells around late morning to early afternoon and let the day unspool without hurry.",
