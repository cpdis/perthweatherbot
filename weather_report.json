    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is clear as glass and the streets feel unburdened, a quiet settled over roofs and trees. Stars have sharp edges, the air leans dry, and the night is pleasant enough for a slow step outside, where the world seems to exhale and pause.\n\nThis run of clarity looks set to carry into dawn, with a bright, unclouded morning on the cards. Sunshine will be abundant; the UV is gentle now but will ramp up quickly after sunrise and bite hard by late morning. A light layer suits the small hours, then shift to airy clothes, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen once the light takes hold. It should feel easy at first, then grow a little stark and glary as the day opens up. If you\u2019re awake, a short stroll or a cup on the back step fits the mood; at first light, water the garden, hang a wash, or bicycle to the bakery before the heat gathers. Later, errands done early will feel kinder than those kept for the noon glare.",
