    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a clean midnight sky, the kind that pares the world back to quiet silhouettes and a cool, honest air. Clarity is excellent; stars feel close, and the night carries that late\u2011winter crispness that nudges you toward a soft jumper or light jacket if you step outside. UV is negligible now, of course, and the streets feel unhurried, glassy with calm.\n\nToward dawn the forecast stays cloudless, so expect a bright, open morning and a day that leans pleasant rather than harsh. The sun will wake gently, then sharpen; UV should be modest early but noticeable by late morning, worth a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out a while. Dress in layers you can shed as the chill loosens its grip. It\u2019s a good morning for small, ordinary victories: a slow walk to the corner for bread, watering the pots, airing the house once the light is up, or cycling to your first appointment. Later, a window seat and a cup of something warm will feel right, with the clear sky inviting a few errands on foot and maybe a quick tidy of the garden while the light stays agreeable.",
