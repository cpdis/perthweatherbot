    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, a gentle chill wraps itself around the city, the kind that whispers promises of warmth ahead. The air carries a subtle hint of fog, lingering briefly before dawn, as if the night itself hesitates to release its hold. Currently, the atmosphere feels crisp under a wide canopy of mostly clear skies, a peaceful prelude with temperatures dipping to a refreshing low. As you meander through the streets, the northwest wind offers a feathered caress, a soft reminder of winter's presence.\n\nTomorrow greets us with the promise of a sun-drenched expanse, where the city basks in the glow of mostly sunny skies. While temperatures will flirt with mid-fifties, a slight dip into the early afternoon may encourage you to keep layers handy. Dressing in light yet warm attire will serve you well; perhaps a cozy sweater paired with a light jacket, perfect for those moments between bursts of sunshine. The allure of such a day invites both stillness and movement; consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, savoring the calming rhythm of the tide or perhaps indulging in a quiet afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, a good book in hand, as life unfolds around you.",
