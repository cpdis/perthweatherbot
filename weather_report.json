    "weather_report": "An evening chill drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco as nightfall deepens, hinting gently at the possibility of rain, a slight whisper of precipitation before 10 PM. The low, hovering around 52 degrees, settles in with an unassuming presence, accompanied by a southwest breeze that dances between 2 and 10 mph. An air of expectation lingers, though the chance of significant rainfall remains low, with barely a trace anticipated. As the hours slip away, you might notice that the horizon is veiled in a muted cloudiness, painting the cityscape in soft greys.\n\nTomorrow promises a mix of rain showers and fleeting sunshine, as temperatures gently yield from a high of 60, gradually descending as the afternoon progresses. The west-southwest winds, carrying gusts up to 20 mph, will further sweep away any lingering warmth. With a 60% chance of light showers, it might be prudent to consider a light waterproof jacket or an umbrella while setting forth on the day's adventures. Engaging in a cozy caf\u00e9 retreat with a warm cup of something comforting sounds appealing, or perhaps meandering through lesser-traveled streets, taking in the artistry of the city as the clouds shift. At this hour, as the night approaches its zenith, a stroll along the waterfront could provide a breath of fresh air, mingling with the refreshing scent of the ocean, a perfect prelude to the rain that awaits the dawn.",
