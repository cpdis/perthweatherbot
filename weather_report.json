    "weather_report": "Adelaide eases into late afternoon under a softened, pewter sky. The light feels thinned, the air carrying the first suggestion of rain; forecasts call for light showers to drift in around dusk and wander through the evening. Sunshine will be scarce, more a pale rumor than a presence, and the UV sits low and sinking with the hour. The day looks muted and a little smudged at the edges, clear enough to see your way, not bright enough to squint.\n\nThis is a jacket day: a light waterproof over a warm layer, trousers, closed shoes that don\u2019t mind wet pavement, and a small umbrella tucked away. If you\u2019ve errands, take them now and let the tram do the work. A short stroll beneath verandas, a quiet ten minutes at the library before it shuts, then home to put a pot on the stove, sort the week\u2019s odds and ends, or line up tomorrow\u2019s lunch. Evening plans still work, but a hood and an unhurried pace will feel kind.",
