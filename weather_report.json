    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere this afternoon invites a sense of calm clarity. The sun shines brightly, illuminating the cityscape and creating a stark contrast against the deep blue sky. Temperatures hover around a cool 58 degrees, gradually dipping toward 53 as the day advances. A gentle west-northwest breeze adds a refreshing touch, rustling leaves and stirring the San Francisco air, while the absence of fog offers pedestrians an unobstructed view of iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and the shimmering bay.\n\nAs twilight approaches, tonight promises mostly clear skies with a low dipping to about 46 degrees. The remnants of warmth from the day will linger, but a light jacket or a cozy sweater will be advisable for those venturing outside. With these delightful conditions, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a low-key gathering at a local caf\u00e9. The day\u2019s serene glow is perfect for unwinding, be it with a book in hand at a park or sharing stories with friends beneath the evening sky. Embrace the captivating essence of the city wrapped in such agreeable weather.",
