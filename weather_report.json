    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air is brisk and clear, with a gentle whisper of wind carrying the promise of a crisp evening. The city, silhouetted against the vibrant glow of scattered lights, stands still under a blanket of serenity. The temperature dips to a refreshing low, hinting at coolness that invites snug sweaters and scarves without quite demanding heavy coats. Tonight, the faint breath of a north-northeast wind teases the crispness into delightful contrasts.\n\nTomorrow unveils itself under the golden embrace of sunny skies, projecting a pleasant warmth that invites wanderers to partake in the city's charms. Expect midday highs to garner affection just shy of fifty-eight degrees, while afternoon breezes sweep through, offering a soft caress to sunlit faces. The absence of fog suggests the marine layer has taken a departure for now, revealing the iconic landmarks in all their majestic clarity. Consider a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, or an exploration along the waterfront as the light dances upon the bay. Comfortable layers will serve you well, balancing the coolness in the morning and the gentle warmth of the afternoon. This is a day tailored for simple joys, where the city unfurls its treasures beneath a canvas of blue.",
