    "weather_report": "In the enchantingly muted embrace of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco is caught in the gentle clasp of twilight's residue, where a sea of fog lazily rolls through the city, hinting at the lingering presence of a marine layer. As dawn approaches, this patchy veil of mist will usher in a transformation, offering a glimpse of sunlight that struggles to break through but eventually will, coaxing the landscape from slumber into a warm, partly sunny day, albeit with a high that flirts with the coolness of 59 degrees before surrendering to a slight drop as afternoon unfolds.\n\nWhile the wind lingers softly from the northeast, at around seven miles per hour, the ambiance remains crisp and invigorating, paving the way for a day that carries an air of refreshing clarity. Attire should embrace this gentle chill \u2014 a light jacket or layering would provide comfort, keeping the spirit buoyant against the cool breeze as one ventures out. Today is a perfect occasion to wander through local boutiques, explore quaint cafes offering heartwarming treats, or stroll through the serene Embarcadero, taking in the sights of the bay as it shimmers against the emerging sunlight. The day promises simple pleasures as it unfolds, inviting the city\u2019s residents to bask in its calm allure.",
