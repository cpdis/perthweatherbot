    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco is slipping into a soft grey, the light thinning as clouds gather with that familiar, rain-scented hush. Sunshine is scarce now and any breaks will be brief; the UV has eased to low and will fade to negligible by evening. The horizon looks a little smudged, not foggy so much as muted, with a calmness that suggests drizzle waiting in the wings.\n\nShowers are likely to arrive around dusk and return later in the evening, more a polite tapping than a downpour, leaving pavements dark and reflective. It reads as a gently damp night rather than an ordeal: comfortable if you\u2019re layered, with a light waterproof or a compact umbrella and shoes you don\u2019t mind getting speckled. Consider finishing errands before the first patter, then reward yourself with small, ordinary pleasures indoors\u2014slice bread from the corner bakery, put a pot on the stove, sort the week\u2019s lists at the kitchen table\u2014or take a short, hood-up wander beneath shopfront awnings and let the town settle around you.",
