    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a pleasant sun, casting a warm, golden glow over the city. Currently, the sky is clear and vibrant, the only hints of the city's notorious fog absent, leaving the iconic skyline of skyscrapers and the lush hills distinctly visible. A gentle northwest breeze, brisk yet inviting, dances around the streets, adding a refreshing note to the afternoon. The temperature, slowly settling around the mid-fifties, feels pleasant, especially with the promise of sunshine to brighten your path. \n\nAs evening approaches, the sky promises to remain mostly clear, with temperatures dipping but gradually rising as night sets in, creating a cozy atmosphere perfect for a leisurely stroll down to the waterfront or a casual dinner in one of the quaint local eateries. It is advisable to wear layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable shirt\u2014to adapt to the cooling air while still enjoying that gentle warmth from the afternoon sun. A walk along the Embarcadero could be especially rewarding, where the views of the Bay Bridge glistening against the twilight sky await, providing a serene backdrop for reflection or simple enjoyment.",
