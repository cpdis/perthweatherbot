    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a soft grey lid, the light flattened and pewter at this early hour. Overcast skies hang steady through dawn into the morning, muting the sun to a pale suggestion; UV is low now and likely stays gentle while the ceiling holds, though any stray break later could sharpen it quickly, as spring likes to do. The air feels cool to mild and the day looks clear in the practical sense\u2014no fog, no drama\u2014just a quiet, evenly lit canvas with fewer shadows and softened edges.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of morning that invites easy choices: a warm cup carried on a short walk, an unhurried ride to the shops, errands done before the day stirs itself. Dress in light layers\u2014long sleeves or a soft jacket you can shed if the sky lightens\u2014comfortable shoes, and a cap or sunglasses tucked away in case the cloud thins. There\u2019s no strong hint of rain in the early hours, only that calm, steady overcast that makes reading by a window feel luxurious and a visit to the market or gym pleasantly unremarkable. Let the pace be low and companionable; the sun, if it shows, will do so shyly.",
