    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a cloak of serene clarity. The first hints of daylight reveal a mostly clear sky, promising a tranquil day ahead. Temperatures linger in the low forties, with a gradual rise to the mid-fifties by afternoon. A gentle north wind whispers through the streets, inviting those brave enough to step outside to embrace the chill with a cozy layering of warm clothing. \n\nAlthough the horizon may glimmer with the lingering memories of fog along the coast, the immediate atmosphere feels refreshingly crisp and inviting. Today offers a canvas for simple pleasures: a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, savoring a warm mug of coffee as you soak in the sights and sounds of the waking city. In the spirit of the final day of the year, perhaps take a moment in a nearby park, where the fresh air may inspire quiet reflection amidst the seasonal buzz. Choose attire that melds comfort with practicality\u2014a light jacket, knit scarf, and perhaps a sturdy pair of boots will serve well against the coolness of the morning and the fading daylight.",
