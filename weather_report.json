    "weather_report": "Before sunrise in Bend, the sky wears a soft, ragged blanket; the town is quiet under a gentle gray that breaks and reforms. As the morning advances, that ceiling loosens into scattered clouds, letting silvery winter sun slip through. Expect a day that leans bright but never glaring, with open views when the blue widens and a clean, calm light on the high desert palette. The sun has a mild hand this time of year: UV stays low early and only nudges toward moderate around midday if the breaks hold.\n\nDress in comfortable layers\u2014a warm coat over a sweater, a knit hat or earband, and sunglasses in your pocket for sudden shafts of light. It\u2019s a good morning for small ambitions: an unhurried loop around the neighborhood with a warm cup, a midmorning grocery run while the sky clears, sorting a shelf in the garage with the door cracked to the fresh air, or settling by a bright window to read while the clouds idle past.",
