    "weather_report": "As the evening wraps Downtown San Francisco in a chilly embrace, the forecast hints at a night of rain beginning after ten, shrouding the city in the promise of a wet, reflective tableau. Despite the clouds that loom over the horizon, there is a comforting glow from the city lights, creating a cozy contrast against the advancing dark. The temperatures hover near a cool 52, inching slightly upward as the hours pass, while gusty winds whisper tales of storms to come, signaling a robust change in the air. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect rain to paint the city in shades of grey, transforming familiar streets into slick corridors. With a high nearing 59, the chill will settle in deeper by afternoon, making layering essential\u2014a cardigan or a light jacket would be wise, complemented by sturdy shoes for those who dare to venture out. While the dampness may deter some, it is a perfect chance to embrace the quietude of an afternoon spent inside a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth of coffee can compete with the chill outside, or perhaps to delve into an art gallery, where the rainy ambiance can lend an introspective mood to the exhibits. While the fog may not blanket the city tonight, the gentle presence of a marine layer lingers just offshore, a reminder of San Francisco's ever-changing embrace with the sea. This evening promises a tender transition into a damp Wednesday, softly urging one to find comfort indoors amidst the approaching storm.",
