The chill lingers in the air, an invitation to layer up\u2014perhaps a lightweight jacket will suffice for a morning stroll, or even a cozy sweater for those who tend to feel the sea breeze more keenly. With a low temperature settling around 50 degrees, the heart of the city remains wrapped in that familiar, comforting coolness.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the warmth of the sun to gradually take center stage, coaxing temperatures to peak near a pleasant 64 degrees. Despite this promise of sunlight, the afternoon may see a slight retreat to about 59 degrees, hinting at the intermittent cloud cover that can weave through the daylight. The calm south-southwest winds contribute a gentle warmth, about 2 to 8 mph, caressing the city and hinting at the soft embrace of autumn. However, residents and visitors may notice a marine layer, delicately draping over the vistas, particularly at the bridges\u2014 a faint memory of summer\u2019s fog, now receding as the sun asserts itself. With these conditions, a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps with a view of the bay, might prove to be the perfect way to savor the day.",
