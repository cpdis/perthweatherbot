    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a clear sky, casting a gentle light across the cityscape. With no fog to soften the sharpness of the skyline, it is a brilliant contrast to the muted tones often seen in winter. As the temperatures hover near the mid-fifties, the cool air carries a refreshing crispness, inviting layers that blend comfort and warmth. A light west wind whispers through the streets, just strong enough to remind you of the city's spirited nature without being intrusive.\n\nAs the afternoon approaches and the temperature begins to dip slightly, this is the perfect moment to slip on a cozy cardigan or a light jacket, perhaps paired with well-worn denim or a long skirt that flows gracefully through the sunlit streets. The day\u2019s serene atmosphere calls for pleasant explorations\u2014maybe a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the comforting aroma of fresh brew complements the day's ambiance. Embrace this moment of clarity; it\u2019s an opportunity to savor the city's charm without the distractions of clouds or fog.",
