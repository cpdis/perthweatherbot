    "weather_report": "Late afternoon settles over Perth with a dappled sky, the sun slipping in and out of scattered clouds and casting a gentle, shifting light. The air feels clear and easy to breathe, the kind of brightness that softens rather than glares. Visibility is good, shadows are lengthening, and the day has the calm, unhurried clarity of early evening.\n\nExpect the scattered cloud to linger toward dusk and into the early night, with sunshine thinning as the hours pass. The UV has eased and will keep dropping; if you\u2019re out before sunset, a touch of protection is sensible, but for most, it\u2019s a low-fuss affair. Dress in light layers you can shed and reclaim, sunglasses handy until the sun slides closer to the horizon. It\u2019s a pleasant time for an easy stroll along quiet streets, a small errand by bike, or an early supper outdoors while the sky drifts between silver and pale blue. Indoors, throw open a window and finish the day\u2019s loose ends in that mellow, forgiving light.",
