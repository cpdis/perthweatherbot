    "weather_report": "As night falls over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crispness that is unassuming yet invigorating. The skyline, distinct against a backdrop of minimal clouds, appears serene and welcoming. Though the temperature will dip to around 48 degrees, the gentle west wind whispers promises of quietness rather than chill. For this evening, a light jacket or a cozy sweater may suffice, allowing one to comfortably stroll through the quiet streets or perhaps enjoy a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, the rich aroma swirling around like the gentle breeze.\n\nTomorrow promises a bright embrace as sunshine glides across the city, peeking through the golden strands of the morning. Highs are expected to be near 61 degrees, tapering off slightly as the afternoon winds in. With clear skies and minimal fog infiltrating the horizon, it presents an ideal backdrop for leisurely walks around the Presidio or a delightful visit to the Ferry Building Marketplace. There\u2019s a pulse of warmth to the air that invites casual explorations, so dress in layers to fully relish the day while basking in the gentle sun. It\u2019s a time for savoring simple pleasures, enhancing the city's enchanting beat and weaving through its scenic charm.",
