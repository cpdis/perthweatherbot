    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a blanket of dense clouds, bearing the weight of impending rain. The air, laden with moisture and the palpable chill of the south-southeast breeze, carries whispers of an 80% chance of precipitation. As the day wears on, temperatures slide downwards, resting just shy of 60 degrees. The view is shrouded, with visibility diminished, making the iconic landmarks appear more like shadowy ghosts than vibrant beacons. \n\nTonight promises to swell with the rhythm of rain, an unwavering 100% chance ensuring that the streets will glisten with fresh droplets.

It\u2019s a time to embrace comfort; layering with a warm jacket and waterproof boots is wise. As for activities, the allure of a cozy caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup of coffee or tea feels particularly inviting, offering a retreat from the dampness.
