    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a serene sun, showcasing a rare clarity that allows views to stretch across the bay with an inviting brilliance. The air carries a crispness, heartening yet subtly cooling as temperatures begin their gentle decline from their high in the low 60s. The north wind whispers its way through the streets, urging a light sweater or a cozy jacket, especially as the evening descends.\n\nAs twilight approaches, a patchwork of partly cloudy skies adds depth to an otherwise clear canvas, with temperatures dipping into the cool realm of the low 40s. This transition invites evening strolls through picturesque neighborhoods or perhaps a gathering with friends at a cozy caf\u00e9, where warm drinks can ward off the chill. The absence of fog paints an inviting picture, hinting at a pleasant and well-defined evening, perfect for lingering moments under the stars.",
