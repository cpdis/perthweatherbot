    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the air is thick with the promise of rain which lingers until late afternoon. Currently, the skies are draped in a gauzy shroud, casting a muted light across the cityscape. The chill, hovering around 58 degrees, penetrates easily through the dampness in the air, suggesting that a cozy layer would be prudent\u2014think a light jacket or a warm sweater paired with a sturdy pair of shoes to contend with any occasional sprinkles that might fall. \n\nBy tonight, the clouds will shift ever so slightly, offering a glimpse of stars against a backdrop of partly cloudy skies as temperatures dip to around 45 degrees. The breeze from the northwest, light yet refreshingly crisp, will invite evening strolls or the simple pleasure of a warm drink in a favorite armchair. It's a day where one might relish the idea of flipping through pages of a good book or enjoying a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9, as the world outside softens in the gentle embrace of the impending night.",
