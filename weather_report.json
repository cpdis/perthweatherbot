    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks into the early hours of a tranquil yet damp San Francisco night, the city finds itself shrouded in a thick veil of rain and clouds. The air is cool, hovering at a brisk 57 degrees, punctuated by a relentless south-southeast wind that whips through the streets at a steady 17 miles per hour, with gusts that surge like playful specters up to 35 miles per hour. The promise of rain is palpable, where droplets gather in anticipation, whispering tales of onto the awnings and streets below. A complete 100% chance of precipitation looms, hinting at new rainfall amounts that will soon make their presence felt, nurturing the earth beneath. \n\nAs dawn approaches, Friday will offer little respite from the dampness, with clouds enveloping the skyline and high temperatures barely reaching 62 before retreating to an afternoon chill. The outlook remains decidedly gloomy, shrouded in thick fog, especially near the Golden Gate and across the bay where the marine layer lingers like an uninvited guest. It would be wise to don layers\u2014perhaps a water-resistant jacket paired with a warm sweater\u2014to embrace comfort while navigating the city. For your morning excursions, consider sipping a hot cup of coffee while exploring cozy nooks in a local cafe or perhaps indulging in the tranquility of a bookshop, tucked away from the downpour. A gallery or museum visit, free from the elements, offers a serene escape to appreciate art while the storm sings its soothing lullaby outside.",
