    "weather_report": "Morning in Busselton opens on a polished blue sky, the kind that makes colors snap and edges look freshly cut. The sun is already assertive and set to rule the day; the forecast holds clear from late morning into afternoon with no cloud to soften the glare. Expect brilliant visibility and a summery warmth that feels pleasant in shade but fierce in full sun, with UV rising to very high or even extreme by midday.\n\nDress light and breathable, with a wide-brim hat, sunglasses, and proper sunscreen; long sleeves are wise if you\u2019ll be out through lunch. It\u2019s a good hour for a quiet stroll along the foreshore, a coffee tucked under an awning, or a couple of errands by bike before the light turns hard. As the day brightens, let the shade be your accomplice: read on a veranda, tend to small indoor tasks, then step back out when the afternoon eases for an unhurried wander by the bay.",
