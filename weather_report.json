    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a soft, persistent rain, the sort that hushes the streets and draws halos around the lamps. The sky is a seamless quilt of cloud, so there\u2019s no sunshine left to chase, and the UV is essentially nil; even earlier, the light would have been weak and filtered. The air feels cool and a little tender on the skin, and the view down the block blurs at the edges where drizzle meets pavement.\n\nLight showers are expected to continue on and off through the night, more nuisance than drama. Dress for damp: a light waterproof or compact umbrella, breathable layers, and shoes that don\u2019t slip on slick stones. It\u2019s a good night for small, ordinary comforts\u2014a quick grocery run, a quiet tram ride, tidying the kitchen, or reading a chapter while something simple simmers. If you do step out, a calm stroll beneath awnings is enough; let the rain set the tempo and keep the evening unhurried.",
