    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a crisp morning unfolds, marked by a gentle sun illuminating the city's iconic skyline. The day begins with clear skies, a welcome respite from the fog that often cloaks this coastal locale. Yet, as the sun climbs, temperatures are poised to subtly dip, creating a curious interplay of warmth and chill. A light west-southwest breeze carries whispers of the bay, bringing a refreshing clarity to the air. \n\nAs the daylight stretches, one may notice the lingering presence of a thin marine layer, draping the distant hills. For those venturing outdoors, a light jacket could serve as a companion against the cool air, especially as evening approaches and temperatures slide toward the mid-forties. This serene weather invites a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while absorbing the vibrant energy that ebbs and flows through the city's streets at this quiet time of day.",
