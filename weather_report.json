    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of patchy fog clings to the skyline, obscuring the usual sharp contours of the city. The air is crisp, the temperature resting near the chilly end of its range as the sun struggles to break through the mist. A north wind whispers through the streets, sporadically nudging the fog but leaving a gentle chill that suggests dressing in layers\u2014a woolen sweater beneath a snug jacket will provide comfort against the cool breeze.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, the forecast warns of a change, with rain anticipated after ten o\u2019clock. The clouds will gradually thicken, transforming the soft morning light to a muted, more somber hue. While the scene outside remains visually captivating, the moisture in the air transforms it into a tapestry of muted grays and whites. Urban hikers might find the charm of the weather lends itself well to quiet strolls along the waterfront, or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, sheltered from the upcoming rain. With the certainty of precipitation later in the evening, it\u2019s wise to plan for an indoor activity as the hours pass\u2014a bookshop or a gallery could provide a delightful retreat as the city readies itself for a rainy night.",
