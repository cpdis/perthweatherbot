    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the clear skies provide a serene backdrop, allowing a chill that hints at the pristine clarity of the evening air. The temperature sits comfortably around the low forties, with gentle breezes stirring at a modest pace from the north-northeast. The absence of fog assures a crisp visibility that paints the cityscape in stark outlines, inviting passersby to appreciate the shimmering city lights and the distant whisper of the Golden Gate. \n\nLooking forward to the day ahead, the sun will make a timely appearance, bathing the city in warmth that ascends to a pleasant fifty-seven before retreating gently in the afternoon. The winds will remain mild, fostering an atmosphere that encourages outdoor strolls, perhaps a leisurely walk along the waterfront or an exploration of the leafy parks that crisscross the hills. Dressing in layers will be wise; a light jacket will fend off the cool breeze, while a comfortable shirt beneath allows for adaptability as the sun begins its ascent. Whether one choose to sip coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9 or enjoy a quiet moment observing the rhythmic ebb of the bay, today promises a tempered delight amid the dynamic pulse of the city.",
