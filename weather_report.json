    "weather_report": "As daylight begins to break over San Francisco, the atmosphere remains thick with promise, albeit muted by the shadow of clouds that linger after a cool night. Currently, the city wears a cloak of gray, but the air is brisk and fresh, hinting at the vibrant sun poised to emerge. Temperatures have dipped to a gentle chill, suggesting that early risers should layer up with a warm sweater or light jacket before heading out. The gentle north-northeast breeze carries whispers of the bay as the fog, typical of coastal mornings, is receding to allow clearer views of the iconic skyline.\n\nThroughout Sunday, expect the sun to gradually peel back the layers of cloud, unveiling a mostly sunny day that promises a high of 62; however, as the afternoon settles in, temperatures will gently descend. While the morning may feel brisk, the light of day will surely warm the mood, inviting you to step outside. A stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps with a warm cup of coffee in hand, would perfectly match the day's unfolding beauty, while the faint marine layer pulls back like a soft curtain, revealing the glistening waters of the bay. Consider enjoying the simple pleasure of quiet reflection in one of the city's lovely parks, where the interplay of sun and foliage creates a delightful retreat.",
