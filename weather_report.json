    "weather_report": "As dawn reclaims its place, a gentle chill lingers over Downtown San Francisco, hinting at the rain soon to envelop the city. The sky is a canvas of muted grays, with clouds gathered as if rehearsing a slow, melancholic waltz. The nocturnal serenade of raindrops becomes a reality shortly, with the forecast hinting at an 80% chance of showers\u2014a soft patter expected to awaken the streets. Currently, the air is tinged with anticipation, and the low temperatures create an inviting reason to reach for cozy layers. \n\nThe sight of the Golden Gate Bridge seems blurred from afar, perhaps obscured by a thin veil of fog, which signals the marine layer's gentle caress. Dressing warmly in layers would be wise, as the temperatures will retreat slightly in the afternoon, and a light jacket would suit the day as gusty winds flirt with the chill. Activities that may bloom brilliantly in this softness could include slipping into a local caf\u00e9, where steam rises from mugs and the scent of freshly baked pastries lingers in the air, inviting a moment of calm. Whether it\u2019s revisiting an old favorite book or enjoying the quiet hum of good conversation, today\u2019s weather beckons you to embrace the subtle beauty in the quieter hours of the city.",
