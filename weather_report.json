    "weather_report": "Perth settles into a spotless evening, the sky rinsed clean and quietly luminous above the rooftops. Clouds are absent, the air uncomplicated and gently cooling; with the sun down, UV is essentially asleep and the night feels clear, steady, and kind on the eyes.\n\nThe forecast keeps it cloudless through midnight and into the small hours. Toward dawn the picture stays pure, and once the sun lifts it should be generous and unfiltered, with UV rising fast in that familiar late-summer way. Dress lightly now\u2014short sleeves or a soft layer if you run cool\u2014then plan for airy fabrics at sunrise, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a faithful sweep of sunscreen. This is a good night for a slow lap around the block, a quiet tidy on the veranda, or watering the garden while the world hums low. In the early light, hang a wash, sip coffee outdoors, or slip out for a quick errand before the sun grows insistent.",
