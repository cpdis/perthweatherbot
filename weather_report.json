    "weather_report": "The evening in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a canopy of mostly cloudy skies, with a whisper of drizzle shyly teasing the streets. As the temperature hovers around 54 degrees, a gentle south wind imparts a coolness that invites a cozy sweater or a light jacket. Later, as night deepens, the chance of rain transforms from mere possibility to likelihood, scattering droplets that may linger into the early morning, barely measurable yet softening the edges of the bustling city.\n\nLooking ahead to Veterans Day, the promise of rain looms more substantial, particularly before the afternoon respite. Temperatures are anticipated to wane slightly, sliding down to a mild 56 degrees, while the west-southwest winds usher in gusts that can flirt with 28 mph. Those venturing into the urban tapestry may find the landscape draped in a light veil, as the marine layer creeps in, coaxing the fog that often cloaks the Golden Gate Bridge. This is a day to embrace the indoor comforts of a local caf\u00e9, perhaps with a book in hand, or to enjoy a leisurely stroll under the shelter of an umbrella, finding beauty in the gentle rhythms of a city kissed by rain.",
