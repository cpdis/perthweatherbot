    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a veil of soft, lingering clouds, with hints of the sun trying to break through the morning haze. The pleasant chill in the air suggests the day will be mild, but the forecast indicates a shift to rain later on. A brisk wind stirs, carrying with it the scent of impending moisture and the promise of change. By afternoon, expect the clouds to thicken and the chance of rain to rise, culminating in likely showers that will sweep through after sunset. \n\nOne can anticipate a grey canvas unfolding above, where visibility might be compromised along the coast. The marine layer, typically seen by the Golden Gate, will gather, lending a slightly surreal atmosphere to familiar landscapes. As the weather turns, consider dressing in layers\u2014perhaps a snug sweater underneath a weather-resistant coat to stave off the chill and damp. Given the looming storm, a stroll along the waterfront could transform from a leisurely outing to a more hurried affair. Instead, leisurely indoor pursuits\u2014perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or an afternoon at a local bookstore\u2014might be the wisest choice, allowing you to savor the serene moments before the rain arrives.",
