    "weather_report": "Subiaco is wearing a spotless sky at midday, the light crisp and unwavering, the air clear enough to make edges feel newly sharpened. Expect the sunshine to rule the afternoon with little interruption and a slow, honeyed fade toward evening; the UV index will be running on the high side through early afternoon before easing later, so treat the sun with respect. No hint of rain, and visibility looks excellent.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant day if you keep to shade now and then. Choose breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; carry water, and keep a light extra layer for after sunset when the warmth slips away. Good hours for a shaded late lunch, an unhurried walk to the shops, hanging the washing to dry, or a library visit with a meander home as the light softens. Save anything strenuous for late afternoon when the sun\u2019s edge grows kinder.",
