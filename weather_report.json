    "weather_report": "Waco slides into late afternoon under a clear, forgiving sky, the sun softened to a warm coin drifting toward the horizon. The day has been bright and clean-lined, the air transparent enough to make distant rooftops feel near. With December\u2019s angle, the sun offered a modest bite at midday, but the UV has eased to gentle now; glare is low, shadows are long, and the light carries a quiet gold that makes even parking lots look cinematic. It feels pleasant more than bold, the kind of clarity that slows the pulse.\n\nDress in easy layers: a long-sleeve or light sweater now, a jacket handy once the light fades. Sunglasses help with the last low beams. This is a good hour for simple errands done on foot, a porch sit with a warm cup, a tidy-up of the garden beds, or a small detour to a neighborhood bookstore before dusk. If you\u2019ve been indoors all day, a short, unhurried loop around the block will do; the air is honest, the sky uncomplicated, and evening is arriving without hurry.",
