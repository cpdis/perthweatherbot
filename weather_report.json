    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a clean, open sky tonight, the kind that makes streetlights look shy and the constellations well-spoken. Forecasts keep it cloudless through late evening and after midnight, so expect a crisp, high-clarity night with no haze to soften the edges. Sunshine is offstage for now and the UV index has fallen to nothing; if these clear conditions carry through, morning should arrive bright and unfiltered. It feels like the sort of late\u2011winter evening that asks for a light jacket or a soft jumper, perhaps a scarf if you plan to linger outdoors.\n\nWith the pavements dry and the air steady, it\u2019s a fine time for a quiet loop around the block, a quick walk to fetch milk, or a few minutes on the balcony letting the cool settle while you plan tomorrow. You might water the herbs, lay out your bag for the morning, or simply look up and count how many stars the night is willing to lend you.",
