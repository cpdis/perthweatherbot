The day looks clear enough for long views yet a touch matte around the edges, as if seen through frosted glass. Expect more of this gentle back-and-forth through the afternoon\u2014periods of muted sun, then a veil of cloud\u2014pleasant rather than dramatic. The December sun sits low and mild; UV will be on the gentle side, edging toward moderate when the brighter gaps open.\n\nDress for easy comfort: light layers, a breathable long-sleeve or a thin sweater, a jacket if you run cool, and sunglasses for those sudden bright patches. It\u2019s a day for small, unhurried things\u2014an unambitious walk around the block, a swing by the bakery, tidying the porch, wrapping a few gifts near a window where the light drifts in and out. If you linger outdoors, a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t go amiss, even with the cloud cover.",
