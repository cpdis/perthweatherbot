    "weather_report": "After a pair of light showers earlier in the evening, Netley settles into the small hours with streets dark and glistening, the Solent breathing a damp, salt-tinged hush. Clouds sit low and stubborn, muting the few lamps and hiding the stars; it feels cool rather than cold, and any UV is nil at this hour. Expect the night to stay overcast with the odd sprinkle, the air soft-edged and a little woolly around the distances.\n\nDaybreak is likely to arrive wrapped in the same grey cloth: mostly cloudy, a few light, passing showers, and only brief, shy hints of brightness if the ceiling thins. Sun will be limited and the UV stays low, rising only modestly if a gap opens. Dress for damp pavements and changeable skies\u2014a light waterproof, easy layers, a hood or small umbrella, and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. This is weather for modest plans: set out your morning things now and sleep well; if you\u2019re up early, slip in a shoreline stroll between interruptions, then claim a quiet seat by a caf\u00e9 window, run an errand or two, or wander the park when the drizzle loosens. Let the day be gentle and unhurried, with the rain as background music rather than a headline.",
