    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, moonwashed sky, the streets hushed and the air a touch crisp on the skin. With no clouds in the forecast from the night through early morning, dawn should arrive clean and bright, the sun stepping into a wide, blue stage and sharpening every edge. Expect a very sunny day once the light takes hold; on a clear spring/autumn day like this the UV climbs quickly, so the kindness of early cool will soon give way to a more insistent glare.\n\nDress in light layers you can peel back as the morning warms, and keep a hat, sunglasses, and a dab of sunscreen within easy reach. It looks like a pleasant day for simple rituals: an early walk to catch the first birdsong, a quiet coffee on a balcony, cycling to the shops before the sun gets bossy, or airing the house with fresh, dry air. Later, choose the shady side of the street and let the day hum along at an easy pace while the sky stays clear and uncomplicated.",
