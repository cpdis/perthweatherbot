    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into late afternoon with a clear, open sky and clean light on verandas; toward evening, only a few modest clouds drift in and the air keeps its clarity. It\u2019s dry and untroubled, the kind of sky that makes edges look crisp. The sun still has a little bite but it\u2019s easing now, UV slipping from assertive to gentle as dusk arrives.\n\nIt feels pleasantly warm rather than taxing. Airy layers suit the hour; keep sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen for the next stretch, then a light cardigan for later. Good weather for the ordinary joys: a slow walk to the shops, watering the garden, an unhurried ride home, or an early dinner outdoors while the last gold slides off the rooftops.",
