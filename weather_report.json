    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a bright, sunny sky, casting a gentle radiance over the iconic skyline. The air is crisp yet inviting, a promising start to a day that will see temperatures gradually descend from the near 59 degrees to a comforting 56 by the afternoon. The breeze whispers softly, swirling through the streets at a mild pace, adding to the day's charm, making it an ideal moment for a stroll along the waterfront or through the city's vibrant neighborhoods. As the sun rises, it illuminates every corner, unveiling a landscape devoid of fog, with the Golden Gate Bridge standing proudly against the azure expanse.\n\nAs day transitions to evening, the skies will remain largely clear, with temperatures dipping to around 44 degrees, calling for light layers to embrace the cooler air. A sweater or light jacket would be wise attire for those venturing out for an evening walk, perhaps stopping by one of the local caf\u00e9s for a warm drink. The pleasant conditions beckon opportunities for exploration; consider a visit to a hidden garden or an outdoor art exhibit. With the serenity of the day\u2019s beginning and the promise of a tranquil evening, it is a splendid time to savor the beauty of this enchanting city.",
