    "weather_report": "Tonight, as you wander through Subiaco's hushed streets, the sky features an intricate dance of scattered, then broken clouds, hinting at a celestial moodiness. It's a time where the endless creativity of the night is absorbed in contemplation, offering the air a sumptuous depth. While the lavender twilight transitions smoothly, it\u2019s the sultry embrace of an early summer evening that paints the scene. You sense warmth lingering, a gentle reminder of the sun's golden influence earlier today. With the promise of more clouds approaching as the night progresses, a stroll wrapped in light, comfortable layers will feel both stylish and functional. The UV dance has long retired, giving you the freedom to breathe deeply and enjoy the night\u2019s muted beauty. \n\nFor now, wander into the soft embrace of local cafes, a place where the murmur of conversations becomes a part of the night rhythm. It's an excellent opportunity to savor a comforting cup, be it espresso or herbal infusion, as you bathe in the warm glow of cozy interiors. The clouds, strung across the night sky, invite a promise of reflection, offering an almost spiritual retreat under the urban stars. The gentle breeze, carrying whispers of tomorrow, is your reminder to pace yourself, nestle into spontaneous tranquility, where the mundane transforms into poetry through the simple act of being present.",
