    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips past midnight under a hush of light rain, streetlights smudged by a low, gray ceiling and pavements quietly shining. It\u2019s not a night for stars or sun; UV is essentially asleep until well after dawn. The air feels soft and a touch cool, the kind that asks for a light layer and a hooded jacket if you\u2019re stepping out, with shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. For the moment, it\u2019s a companionable drizzle, more lulling than harsh.\n\nToward the early morning, expect those gentle showers to linger, keeping sunrise muted and the day\u2019s first hours subdued. Sunshine will be scarce at first; if the cloud thins later, the light will sharpen quickly and the UV will surge in the late morning\u2014typical of late spring here\u2014so keep sunscreen and sunglasses within reach. It looks like a day that begins quietly and damp, better suited to an unhurried coffee and a small errand list than grand plans: a tram ride into town, a stop at the bakery, a tidy of the balcony while the rain softens the air. Dress in breathable layers with a rain shell handy, and let the day reveal its brighter patches if they come.",
