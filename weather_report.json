    "weather_report": "Mid-morning in Subiaco arrives with a clean, opening sky; late morning into early afternoon looks mostly sunny with just a few clouds wandering by. The day reads clear and well-behaved, visibility crisp and colors a little sharper than usual. Expect the UV to climb quickly toward midday\u2014bright rather than brutal\u2014so a brimmed hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and breathable layers you can slip off will suit the hours ahead. It feels like a day for modest adventures: a coffee at an outdoor table, a gentle walk to the shops before lunch, a quiet read in the dappled shade while the sun hums along overhead. Windows cracked and laundry on the line will do well; if you\u2019re cycling or running errands, go now or wait for the later afternoon when the edge softens, and keep a bottle of water within easy reach. Work with the light\u2014short outings in the open, then a courteous retreat to the shade when the noon glare takes center stage.",
