    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere unfolds under a dense veil of clouds, draped heavily above the city. As raindrops start their descent, the day is marked by an unmistakable chill, wrapping around you like a damp shawl. Temperatures hover in the low sixties, with a steady south wind whispering through the streets, heralding gusts that make even the trees sway with an animated dance. The anticipated rainfall promises to transform familiar terrain into a glistening tapestry, with new accumulations likely surpassing a couple of inches. \n\nAs dusk approaches, the rain lingers, accompanied by a blend of coolness and humidity that sweeps through the air. With the low settling around fifty-two, it's advisable to don layers that can withstand both the moisture and the cool breeze, perhaps a water-resistant jacket paired with a soft sweater underneath. The evening calls for muted activities; consider exploring a cozy caf\u00e9 where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the scent of rain on pavement, or perhaps lose yourself in the pages of a book alongside the gentle patter of rain against the window. For those feeling adventurous, a stroll through the misty streets can be invigorating, as the city's twilight ambiance takes on a mysterious charm under the swirling fog.",
