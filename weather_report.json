    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries a gentle blend of sun and cloud, revealing glimpses of blue that invite the curious to gaze beyond. With a mild high hovering around 59 degrees, the city's weather reflects its capricious nature: there\u2019s a humidity-laden whisper of rain anticipated, casting a veil over the inherent vibrance of the day. That expected precipitation approaches, but for now, the world feels momentarily bright, even as the clouds begin to assemble for their impending performance.\n\nAs dusk settles in, the rain will make its entrance, cloaked in confident gray. The temperature will drop to a comfortable 51 degrees, softly urging residents to wrap themselves in layers against the refreshing chill of the evening breeze. A casual stroll through the twisting streets may be accompanied by the patter of light rain, an excuse to explore the city\u2019s cozy caf\u00e9s or embrace the warmth of a good book at home. Given the conditions, an umbrella, a light jacket, and perhaps a spirited conversation with a friend would make for a pleasant evening as you savor the city's enchanting ambiance against the impending rain.",
