    "weather_report": "Arthur River spends the late afternoon under a polished blue sky, the kind that makes edges sharp and colors a little truer. The day has been clean and cloudless since morning, and it remains bright and dry now, with sunlight softening as it angles toward evening. Under these clear skies the UV would have been punchy around midday; it\u2019s easing now but still has a little bite, so a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t be wasted. Light layers feel right\u2014something you can shrug off in a sunny spot and pull back on as the shadows lengthen.\n\nExpect the serenity to hold through dusk: a clear, golden close and then a crisp, uncomplicated night. It\u2019s pleasant in that quiet, practical way\u2014good for a slow walk by the water, a quick errand in town, airing the house, or tending to the little tasks that are better done when the weather isn\u2019t getting in the way. If you\u2019re lingering outdoors, bring a light jumper for after sunset and enjoy the clarity while it lasts.",
