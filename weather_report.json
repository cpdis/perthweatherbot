    "weather_report": "Evening slides over Katy and the sky comes up clean, a pane of dark glass with a few careful stars. The forecast keeps it cloudless through late evening into midnight, a gentle, starlit stretch with no sun left to bite; the UV index is effectively nil, and if these clear skies hold, dawn should arrive bright and uncomplicated. The night feels agreeable rather than stern\u2014cool enough to nudge you toward a light jacket, warmer layer if you intend to linger, but not a night to hurry through.\n\nIt\u2019s a good time for the small, pleasant errands of life: a slow lap around the block, the dog nosing the air; sorting tomorrow\u2019s to\u2011dos on the porch; a quiet grocery run or topping off the tank without the day\u2019s glare. Visibility is crisp, the mood untroubled, the kind of clear night that invites unhurried footsteps and a patient mind.",
