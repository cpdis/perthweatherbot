    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, tender sky; the night is thinning and the first wash of pale gold is sliding along the eastern roofs. Air is calm and clean, with stars fading out of a deep velvet blue. Expect a lucid sunrise and a day that opens wide to full sun, the kind that paints sharp edges on everything and leaves no corners dim. UV will surge quickly after sunrise and stay very high through late morning into early afternoon, so shade will be your best friend once the light hardens.\n\nIt looks like an inviting morning and a demanding midday. Step out early in breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; carry water as the brightness gathers. Good hours for a quiet walk past blooming verges, to hang the washing, or to take a book to a caf\u00e9\u2019s shaded table. Run your errands before lunch, then let the sun do its work while you retreat to a cool room, a library stack, or a slow chore by a fan. As the glare softens later, another unhurried lap around the block will finish the day comfortably.",
