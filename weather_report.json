    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a gentle warmth over Downtown San Francisco, illuminating the cityscape under a clear sky with only the slightest hint of cloud cover. With temperatures hovering around a mild 62 degrees, the chill of the morning gives way to a pleasant climate as the day unfolds. There is a light breeze from the northeast, softly rustling the leaves and inviting passersby to take in the views without the nuisance of fog, which remains at bay today. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge stands proud against a backdrop of blue, its outlines sharply defined; the usual marine layer is absent, offering expansive vistas of both the city and the bay.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the temperatures will dip to around 45 degrees, creating a snug atmosphere perfect for layering. A light jacket or a warm sweater will suffice as the night settles in, with gentle winds breathing through the streets. Given the day\u2019s inviting conditions, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the open-air cafes would be ideal activities to embrace the charm of the city. The warmth of the sun paired with the coming tranquility of evening offers a perfect backdrop for reflecting on the day or enjoying the company of friends in a welcoming outdoor space.",
