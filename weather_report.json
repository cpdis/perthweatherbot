    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours past midnight, Subiaco slumbers softly beneath a canopy of scattered clouds, their gentle presence offering a tender embrace to the waning night. The air, kissed by the cool breath of a lingering dusk, promises tranquility as the dawn inches forward. As morning unfurls its canvas, the sun will scatter its light through the thinning clouds, casting a delicate interplay of shadows and warmth over the waking town. The day ahead holds the promise of gentle sunlight filtering through a partly-clouded sky\u2014a day neither too bright nor too dull, where the glow feels more like a gentle whisper of spring's embrace. Dressing comfortably in layers seems prudent, allowing for the early chill to meet the gradual warmth with graceful adaptability. Consider seizing this day for an unhurried walk to a favorite caf\u00e9 or a quiet read on a sun-dappled bench. Embrace these moments of serenity and recollection as the day unfolds with a grace that's neither hurried nor demanding, offering just enough light to illuminate without the starkness of an unbroken sky.",
