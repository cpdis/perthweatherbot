    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a thick blanket of cloud drapes over the city, suppressing the sun's warmth and trajectory. The chilly air settles around 57 degrees, and a gentle southwest wind whispers through the streets. Given the forecast of slight drizzle and intermittent rain later this evening, the atmosphere hints at a typical San Francisco day\u2014moody yet comforting in its own right.\n\nThe sky remains persistently gray, and the chance of drizzle tonight weaves an unhurried rhythm through the evening hours. The low temperature will settle near 54 degrees, and winds may intensify slightly through the night, creating a dance of coolness. Dress warmly, perhaps in layers, pairing a cozy sweater with a light raincoat to shield against possible moisture. With these conditions, consider meandering through nearby cafes, indulging in a hot drink, or browsing artistic enclaves. Alternatively, a stroll along the waterfront, wrapped in a scarf and the murmur of rain in the background, could offer a serene reflection of the city's unique beauty on a day like this.",
