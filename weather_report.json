    "weather_report": "In Subiaco, the early hours slide quietly past, dressed in a silken veil of mist and rain, lending a poetic gloom to streets which whisper with moisture. The recent drizzle has left a thoughtful hush over the sleeping town. Morning will arrive unhurried, heavy with clouds preventing any hopeful notions of sunshine, and the day ahead promises subtle introspection rather than brightness or warmth. Those setting out today should prepare gently, perhaps choosing a comfortable jacket, something with resilient joints for shedding drops of quiet, persistent rain.\n\nGiven the somber skies and dampened spirits, it would be wise to embrace simplicity; savor freshly brewed coffee watching raindrops glide across windowpanes or stroll gently through parks freeing themselves of winter's embrace, feet crunching softly on soaked grass and fallen leaves. Today in Subiaco is a day for contemplation\u2014the subdued beauty of drizzle, the luxury of silence, and the gentle poetry of walking unhurriedly, rhythmically, while the world around settles tenderly into a rainy lullaby.",
