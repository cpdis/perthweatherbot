    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a calm envelopes the city, with the air cooling gently to around 48 degrees. There\u2019s a whisper of wind from the south, barely perceptible at three miles per hour, hinting at the slight shifts that tomorrow will bring. The sky, mostly clear now, offers a tranquil view, unmarred by fog or haze, allowing the city to bask in the serene glow of its streetlights.\n\nCome morning, however, prepare for the embrace of gentle rain beginning around 10 a.m. Clouds, thick and gray, will roll in, shrouding the vibrant cityscape in a muted palette. As temperatures peak in the afternoon near 58 degrees\u2014then subtly sinking to 56\u2014the atmosphere will grow heavier with moisture, making cozy layers a wise choice. Perhaps a soft sweater or a light jacket, accompanied by a sturdy umbrella, would suit the mood as the city readies itself for rain. It will be a day less about grand explorations and more about the simple pleasures of warmth, a perfect backdrop for leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or the allure of browsing books within the comforting confines of a secondhand bookstore. As the rain falls softly, it will invite reflection and the quiet joy of taking shelter from the world outside.",
