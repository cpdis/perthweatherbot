    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Subiaco, the morning wears a cloak of heavy rain, whispering its secrets onto rain-soaked streets. The sky has been casting its liquid shadows over the city, subdued and somber under the gray, cloud-laden sky. The heavy intensity of the early morning rain has eased into a gentle, persistent drizzle. With the earth aptly replenished, the atmosphere carries a sense of renewal, albeit with an embrace that lacks warmth or sunlight. The sun seems shy today, hiding its fervor behind the curtains of lingering clouds, so the UV index is unlikely to rise sharply. Such a cloak of overcast skies invites the contemplation of quiet, interior pursuits.\n\nFor today, the ambiance suggests layering oneself in warmth. A raincoat and sturdy boots form a practical ensemble; perhaps a cherished umbrella to dance with droplets and shield oneself from sporadic showers. It's a day best spent in activities that soothe the soul and refuse to rush. Peruse the shelves of a local bookshop, where the fragrance of well-thumbed pages melds with the rain's symphony. Or, find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, wrapped in the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, as the world outside wears a muted palette. Let the day drift gently, mirroring the raindrops sliding languidly down windowpanes, reveling in the serenity of life's slower pace.",
