    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco opens clear and lively, the sun already shouldering through a handful of roaming clouds. The day looks bright with long stretches of sunshine, only briefly softened by passing puffs of white; visibility feels clean and crisp. Expect the UV to sharpen quickly through the late morning and crest around midday, the kind of light that warms the pavement and asks for a brimmed hat. Air will feel dry and gently warm, growing more assertive as early afternoon arrives.\n\nDress light and breathable, add sunglasses and a good layer of sunscreen, and keep a bottle of water within reach. It\u2019s a pleasant day for small errands on foot, a quiet browse along Rokeby Road, or a mid-morning coffee under an awning where sun and shade trade places. If you\u2019ve laundry to dry, this is perfect; if you\u2019ve a leafy street nearby, take a short amble before the light turns fierce, then retreat to a cool, shaded corner for an unhurried lunch.",
