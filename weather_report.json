    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts into late afternoon under a quilt of cloud, the light gone matte and silvery. The first fringes of rain are closing in, likely to arrive around dusk as a fine mist and then settle into a steadier fall after dark. Sunshine will be scarce, filtered to a faint glow; the UV is low now and will stay that way, with the sky staying closed and the air carrying that clean, rain-on-pavement scent. Visibility is decent but softened, edges blurred, traffic likely a touch slower on slick roads.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for small comforts and modest plans. A lightweight rain jacket, something with a hood, and shoes that won\u2019t mind puddles will serve you well; carry a compact umbrella if you plan to linger outdoors before the heavier showers set in. Consider errands close to home, a quiet hour in a bookshop or a caf\u00e9 window seat, an unhurried tram or bus ride rather than the long walk. Supper early, something warm, and then the gentle percussion of rain for company as evening deepens.",
