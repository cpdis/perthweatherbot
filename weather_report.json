    "weather_report": "Ocean Beach spent the morning under a dull lid of overcast, then loosened to broken clouds by late morning, letting out a few pale shafts of sun. By now, the sky is still mostly veiled, the horizon a soft smudge, and whatever brightness remains is muted and gentle. UV was subdued even at midday and is effectively gone now; the day never really turned brilliant, but it stayed easy on the eyes and kind on the skin.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant, temperate evening for light layers: a soft sweater or windbreaker over comfortable clothes, something you won\u2019t mind catching a hint of salt air. Consider an unhurried walk along the promenade, a quiet errand to the corner market, or a bench on the pier to listen to the waves and watch the occasional gap in the clouds reveal a dim star. If you were out earlier, the sun only flirted through the breaks, so sunglasses were optional; tonight, it\u2019s about keeping warm enough and taking it slow.",
