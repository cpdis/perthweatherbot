    "weather_report": "Adelaide wakes under a quilt of cloud, the light already softened and a hush in the air that hints at showers drifting in around lunchtime and lingering through the afternoon. The sun will be a shy companion today, peeking out only in thin, silvery moments; UV should stay on the gentle side for winter, though a dab of sunscreen at midday never goes astray. Expect a muted, slightly damp day with visibility clean but edges blurred by drizzle, the kind that dapples pavements and lifts the scent of wet gum leaves.\n\nDress for cool, fickle skies: a light waterproof, layers you can peel, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and an umbrella small enough to forget you\u2019re carrying it. It\u2019s a good day for unhurried errands, a quiet loop through a gallery or the market, a tram ride and a long coffee while the showers pass, or a short window-walk between clouds if you crave fresh air. Let the afternoon be practical and kind to yourself; save the sun-chasing for another day.",
