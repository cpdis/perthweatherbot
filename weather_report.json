    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with a glassy, open sky; the evening feels unhurried and dry, the kind that lets you hear your own footsteps. Sunshine is off the stage now, and with it the UV has ebbed to essentially nothing, while the air holds the last of the day\u2019s warmth without any bite, giving the scene a crisp, lucid clarity.\n\nThrough late evening the sky stays clear before a light quilt of scattered cloud drifts in after midnight. It reads as a pleasant night rather than a demanding one; think light layers or a soft cardigan if you step out. A gentle neighborhood walk, a few quiet minutes tending balcony herbs, or simply sitting by an open window to let the calm settle in would suit the mood and the hour.",
