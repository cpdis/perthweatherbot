    "weather_report": "As the early hours of December 12 envelop Downtown San Francisco, the city stirs under a thick quilt of clouds, weaving a soft tapestry of rain. With temperatures hovering around a cozy 50 degrees, the air feels crisp, a reminder that winter has nestled in. The wind, brisk from the west, whips through the streets with a playful intensity, dancing past the buildings and carrying the promise of moisture\u2014up to an inch by dawn. This being a San Francisco winter, the patter of rain is not just a possibility but almost a guarantee, dampening the streets and whispering to anyone brave enough to venture out.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the skies to remain shaded in varying shades of gray, with occasional bursts of downpour likely through the morning before tapering off later in the day. The high will flirt with 57 degrees, but as the afternoon wears on, the chill will settle back to around 54\u2014a reminder of the coastal embrace lurking just beyond the city\u2019s hills. Given the persistent marine layer above, visibility might feel confined, with fog creeping just out of sight over the bridge. \n\nDress in layers, perhaps donning a sturdy rain jacket, well-fitted trousers, and that reliable umbrella, which may become your loyal companion for the day. A warm pair of shoes will shield against the dampness of the sidewalks, allowing for comfortable strides through the city. For the days like these when the weather invites cocooning rather than exuberance, one might find pleasure in a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a rich espresso while the rain taps rhythmically on the windowpanes, or perhaps perusing a well-stocked bookstore, losing oneself in the pages of untold stories as the world outside softens with each passing drizzle.",
