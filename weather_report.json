    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a mellow afternoon light, hinting at a transition through the day. The gentle warmth of the present high around 59 degrees is accompanied by a partly sunny sky that is gradually losing ground as the clouds position themselves for an imminent embrace of rain. While the city basks in moments of clarity, the impending clouds promise a twist in the tale, ushering in a 40% chance of precipitation that may bring a touch of dampness to the sidewalks later in the day.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the anticipation of steady rain looms, with a 90% chance heralding the evening's arrival. The air signals its coolness, dropping to around 51 degrees, accompanied by a light south-southeast wind that whispers through the streets at a gentle pace. Those venturing out should dress warmly, perhaps donning a light jacket or a cozy sweater to safeguard against the chill that mingles with the dampness. With rain expected, planning a stroll beneath a sturdy umbrella might be prudent, or choosing to linger indoors with a warm beverage in hand might prove to be the more inviting option as the evening unfolds in a rhythmic downpour.",
