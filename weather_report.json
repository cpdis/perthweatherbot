    "weather_report": "As the sun glides towards its afternoon repose, Downtown San Francisco envelops itself in a tranquil haze. The air holds a gentle warmth, yet its crispness hints at the cool embrace of twilight approaching. With temperatures near the low fifties, the vitality of the day lingers, though an undercurrent of humidity from the bay suggests that fog is not far behind. The skies boast a patchwork of clouds, most notably a marine layer draped over the Golden Gate, a familiar shawl hinting at the evening's cool descent.\n\nTonight, as the city succumbs to the soft blanket of darkness, the low will hover around the mid-forties. A delicate breeze meanders through the streets, offering a whisper of chill that tugs at any uncovered skin. It is wise to don a light jacket, perhaps a shawl or a cozy sweater, as you step outside, embracing the evening air. An ideal evening might include a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an intimate gathering in a quaint caf\u00e9, where the warmth of conversation mingles with the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The city exudes calm, urging you to savor these moments of respite before nightfall wraps its cool embrace around you.",
