    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under an immaculate sky this late afternoon, the light turning honeyed at the edges while the air stays dry and crystal clear. The day has been unblemished since morning, a hard blue dome and full sun; UV would have run moderate to high around midday, but it\u2019s easing quickly now as the sun begins its slide and the sting softens into warmth. Expect the clarity to hold through the rest of the day with a gentle cool-down toward evening.\n\nDress in light layers: a breathable shirt for the lingering warmth, sunglasses for the bright glare, and if you head out again before the sun sinks much lower, a hat and a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t be wasted; by dusk, a light jacket will feel right. It\u2019s pleasant weather for small errands done on foot, a quiet spin to the library, hanging the last load of washing, or a slow circuit around the neighborhood to clear the day\u2019s chatter before dinner. If you have a balcony or stoop, take ten minutes there and let the sky do its unbusy work.",
