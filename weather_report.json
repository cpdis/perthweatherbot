    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a quilt of soft grey, the morning light muted and thoughtful. Clouds are thickening ahead of a band of light rain due late morning and again after lunch, so any sunshine will be brief and filtered, more a pale shimmer than a blaze. The day won\u2019t feel crisp so much as gently blurred at the edges, the air clear enough but the sky smudged, and though the clouds take the harshness off the glare, late-spring UV can still sneak through around midday.\n\nDress in light layers with a compact rain shell, shoes happy to meet damp pavements, and keep a small umbrella at the ready; carry sunscreen and a brim for those passing bright spells. It\u2019s a good day for unhurried errands between showers, a meander through Subiaco\u2019s shops and arcades, or a quiet perch by a caf\u00e9 window while the rain stipples the street. If you\u2019re staying close to home, tackle a small project, then take a short stroll when the drizzle slackens; the jacarandas will lend the air that faint violet perfume that makes the grey feel kind.",
