    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a rinsed-blue morning, the kind of lucid sky that makes edges sparkle and shadows sharpen. It\u2019s already bright and growing bolder, with the sun taking an unblinking stance; expect a very sunny, crystal-clear day with UV running high to extreme around late morning into mid-afternoon. The air feels open and uncomplicated, the horizon clean, a day made for simple purpose rather than drama.\n\nThrough midday and early afternoon the sky should stay cloudless and candid. Dress for radiance: light, breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses with real grit, and sunscreen you actually reapply; carry water and favor shade when you can. This is a good hour for a quiet coffee beneath an awning, a short errand along tree-lined streets, or hanging the wash to let the sun do honest work. If the glare grows overbearing, retreat to a cool gallery or library, then slip back out later for an unhurried stroll through a small park, letting the late light soften the day\u2019s hard shine.",
