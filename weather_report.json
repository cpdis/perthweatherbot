    "weather_report": "As darkness envelops Downtown San Francisco, raindrops murmur against window panes, setting an intimate tone for the evening. The temperature has dropped, skimming just above fifty degrees, while a brisk south wind stirs the air at a spirited pace. The forecast weaves a tale of relentless rain throughout the night, promising to drench the city with up to an inch of new rainfall, turning streets into glistening reflections beneath muted city lights.\n\nTomorrow promises a continuation of this wet embrace, with rain scheduled to taper off but not without a steely chill lingering in the air. The clouds will hang low, masking the city\u2019s skyline, creating a moody atmosphere that encourages slow, contemplative movements throughout the day. While outdoor activities might seem uninviting, a cozy caf\u00e9 visit with a good book or a leisurely stroll through the misty streets might add solace to an otherwise drizzly day. Wrap yourself in layers to ward off the penetrating cold, perhaps a favorite wool sweater over a lighter jacket, and don\u2019t forget an umbrella\u2014an essential accessory for navigating the enveloping fog and sporadic downpours that define this weather narrative.",
