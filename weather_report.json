    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes 14:12 in Subiaco, the sky above unfurls in boundless clarity, painting the afternoon with a backdrop of serene azure. There's not a wisp of cloud in sight, and the bright sun hangs high, casting a luminous glow across quaint streets and sprawling parks. This is one of those rare days where nature seems to whisper, inviting you to step out and revel in her gentle embrace. Pleasantly warm rays kiss your skin, yet the air retains a refreshing coolness, suggesting a comfort that nudges you towards a leisurely promenade or a relaxed sit on a sun-dappled bench.\n\nWith no threat of inclement weather to cast a shadow on your plans, this clear-skied haven welcomes a light, airy wardrobe. A breathable cotton shirt, perhaps with a favorite pair of sunglasses, would align perfectly with the ambiance. It's the kind of day where you might find yourself wandering through bustling markets, absorbing the aromas of flowering jasmine and freshly brewed coffee, or nestled in a cozy corner of a sunlit caf\u00e9, book in one hand, an espresso in the other. As the afternoon idles gently forward, there's time still to savor this tranquil tableau, perhaps with an impromptu stroll along a winding, tree-lined path. It is a day inviting simplicity and stillness, where the everyday seems effortlessly extraordinary.",
