    "weather_report": "Early afternoon in Subiaco looks kindly: a mostly blue sky with a few idle clouds, sunlight bright but not brash, the air clear enough to see edges sharpen. Expect the sun to keep slipping between patches of cloud through the rest of the day, drifting from mostly sunny to gently filtered by late afternoon. UV sits in the moderate range around now, easing as the light lengthens, so a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen are still prudent if you linger outdoors. The overall feel is mild and easeful, the kind of day that invites unhurried movement and small errands done on foot.\n\nDress in light layers\u2014a long-sleeve or a soft tee with a light jacket you can shrug off\u2014comfortable shoes, and perhaps a scarf for the breeze. The weather suits ordinary pleasures: a lazy amble to a corner caf\u00e9, a loop through the neighborhood with a takeaway cup, tending balcony plants or hanging a fresh wash to dry, a short ride on quiet streets before the shadows grow. If you\u2019ve a book waiting, find a bench in a patch of sun and let the clouds choreograph your intermissions.",
