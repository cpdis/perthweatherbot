    "weather_report": "The night envelops Downtown San Francisco with a gentle grip, the air laden with anticipation as rain gathers its wits to make its entrance. A cloaking blanket of clouds hides the stars, while a soft breeze from the south carries whispers of moisture, promising wet streets by dawn. Low temperatures hover close to 50, with a slight rise in warmth as the night unfolds, hinting at the presence of a day that will be both tumultuous and beautiful.\n\nAs morning beckons, rain will embrace the city before retreating by the afternoon, revealing fleeting patches of sun that clash harmoniously with the drizzling remnants of the early hours. The high barely breaks into the 50s, and the persistent southwest wind suggests a chill that demands respect. The day may not appear as inviting as one hopes, with a 90% chance of precipitation and anticipated amounts reaching a half-inch. Clarity will wrestle with fog, as the marine layer dances around the Golden Gate and scales its way into the heart of the urban landscape. Wrap yourself warmly in layers, perhaps donning a water-resistant coat and sturdy shoes. Under these conditions, a stroll through the quiet, rain-soaked streets could be invigorating; consider slipping into a cozy caf\u00e9 afterward, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air and the raindrops tap a soothing rhythm against the windows. Today\u2019s silhouette is one of resilience, inviting moments of introspection as the city breathes, with each droplet painting its story onto the canvass of existence.",
