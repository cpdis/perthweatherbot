    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is a gentle patchwork, scattered clouds idling over quiet streets and late-night porch lights. The air feels cool and unhurried, with stars peeking through when the clouds drift apart; UV is essentially absent at this hour. It\u2019s a clear-enough night to hear your own footsteps, a soft veil rather than a lid on the sky.\n\nToward dawn the clouds are likely to knit closer, a broken ceiling that turns sunrise into a calm, pewter glow. Expect a day that feels mild rather than dazzling, with sunshine slipping in and out of the gaps; UV will be low early but will wake up through the morning even with cloud, so a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t be wasted. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light sweater over a tee, something you can peel off if the day loosens up. It\u2019s a good morning for unhurried errands, a stroll to pick up bread while the streets are still yawning, a tidy of the desk or balcony plants, and later, a gentle pedal or bus ride to wherever the day quietly asks you to be.",
