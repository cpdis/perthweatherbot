    "weather_report": "The morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco with a delicate contrast of sun and cloud; a fleeting sense of clarity weaves through the skyline, yet the expected embrace of rain looms like a gentle whisper in the distance. As the day progresses, the bright but cool air carries an unmistakable chill, signaling the arrival of precipitation later in the afternoon. The high will hover around a modest 59, before seemingly surrendering to the inevitable decline into the warmth of your favorite sweater. Winds from the west-northwest stir softly, hinting at more tumultuous weather ahead.\n\nAs darkness approaches, the ambiance transforms. The promise of rain becomes a certainty, wrapping the city in a shroud of clouds, with the low dipping to the cool comfort of 50. One can sense that evening wear will soon take precedence; consider layers\u2014an easy-to-slip-on jacket over a cozy turtleneck\u2014as you stroll the streets or find solace in a small caf\u00e9. The night is perfect for unwinding indoors, perhaps indulging in a favorite novel or savoring a hot drink while the rhythmic patter of raindrops sets the mood. It\u2019s the kind of evening where a well-worn blanket and a good book beckon, as the soft, steady rain begins to patter down\u2014a call to reflect and relax, an invitation from the heart of the city.",
