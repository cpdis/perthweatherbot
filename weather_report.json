    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Katy with a soft, pewter ceiling, the kind that catches distant streetlights and turns them to a gentle glow. Earlier, the day flirted with sunshine through scattered clouds before a thicker, broken quilt moved in, leaving light subdued and edges blurred. The sun was tame today, and by now the UV is little more than a memory, negligible under the winter dark. The air reads as calm and mild for December, the kind of night that doesn\u2019t insist on itself.\n\nExpect the cloud cover to loiter through the night, but without any real threat of rain. A light jacket or sweater will do, comfortable shoes if you step out. This is a pleasant, unhurried evening: walk a quiet block and listen to the hush, drop a book at the library return, or sit by a window with a warm mug and let the muted sky keep you company.",
