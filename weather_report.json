    "weather_report": "As night envelops San Francisco, the air is thick with rain, drumming a steady rhythm against the pavement. The chill hangs in the atmosphere, with temperatures resting around a cool 50 degrees, hinting at a rise to 56, a minor reprieve before the real deluge. The South wind breathes fiercely, sending gusts that rustle leaves and send umbrellas billowing. The forecast promises a relentless downpour, with chances of thunderstorms dancing through the early morning. Tomorrow won\u2019t fare much better; expect a string of showers and intermittent rumbles of thunder throughout the day, as the clouds cling stubbornly to the skyline, wrapping the city in a damp embrace.\n\nThe visibility is tempered, veiled by the marine layer that blurs the outlines of familiar sights, the Golden Gate Bridge rendered a ghostly silhouette. Instead of seeking the sun, residents might find solace in cozy corners of local caf\u00e9s, where warm drinks might thaw chilled fingers and the scent of fresh pastries wafts like a warm hug. Layered clothing is recommended\u2014think sweaters beneath a waterproof jacket, with sturdy shoes at the ready for puddle-laden streets. Embrace the rhythm of the rain; perhaps take a stroll with an umbrella, where each droplet is a note in nature\u2019s symphony, reminding you that even the most subdued days hold their own charm.",
