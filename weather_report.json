    "weather_report": "As night drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a gentle coolness that settles around 47 degrees, coaxing the evening into a tranquil embrace. The breeze, soft at just a whisper, dances from the north-northeast, adding a crisp touch to the stillness. The forecast hints at a sunny Thursday ahead, with a high near 59 degrees that will wane to a chillier 56 in the afternoon, promising a day that glimmers with potential.\n\nAt this hour, the golden glow of the city lights sparkles against the encroaching darkness, their reflections twinkling like distant stars woven into the urban tapestry. The marine layer remains elusive tonight, hinting at fog's presence hovering close but not yet enveloping the Golden Gate or the vibrant downtown skyline. Tomorrow\u2019s promise of sunshine invites outdoor pursuits\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the bay\u2019s soft lapping against the shore serenades those who venture out, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, allowing for a warm drink paired with the soft morning rays. In this season of fleeting warmth, layers are key: a light jacket or sweater to ward off the evening chill, balanced with a cozy scarf for extra comfort. What awaits is a day painted with the quiet beauty of San Francisco, waiting for you to step into its canvas.",
