    "weather_report": "As the new year unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the morning light reveals a city wrapped in the gentle embrace of a soft marine layer, a signature of this coastal enclave. The sky hangs low, draped in a quilt of muted gray, reflecting the day's promise of mild temperatures. Although it is partly sunny, the lingering clouds suggest an ambiance that is both serene and contemplative, inviting the kind of introspection that only the new year can inspire.\n\nIn this atmosphere, the temperature hovers at a comfortable 57 degrees, but with the afternoon drawing near, it is expected to dip to about 55. A light southeast wind whispers through the streets, carrying a trace of the bay's briny breath. For those venturing outside, a layered outfit will serve well\u2014a light sweater or jacket, perhaps paired with a scarf to ward off the coolness that accompanies the clouds. Whether you choose to wander the waterfront, savoring a quiet walk along the Embarcadero, or explore the artistic corners of the city, today beckons softly without the rush of the sun. Embrace the subdued beauty around you, as the city invites a slower pace, perfect for moments of reflection and simple pleasures amidst the fog's embrace.",
