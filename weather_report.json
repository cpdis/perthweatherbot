The day wore a heavy lid of cloud from midday on, and the sun never really had its say; UV exposure was minimal, the light subdued and silvery at best, with edges of the landscape softened by the overcast and showers.\n\nIt\u2019s a night for soft layers and a light waterproof if you step outside, and shoes that don\u2019t mind wet sidewalks. The mood is calm rather than cheerful, but not unfriendly: a good time to brew something warm, read a few unhurried pages, or sort tomorrow\u2019s to-dos while the house settles. If you\u2019re out early, expect the gray to linger and the air to feel cool and clean; drive unhurried, lights on, and let the day come to you.",
