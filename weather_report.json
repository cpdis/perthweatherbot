    "weather_report": "Rottnest wakes under a polished, salt-bright sky; the light is already crisp enough to throw hard edges on the dunes and turn the sea into hammered glass. With the forecast holding clear through midday and early afternoon, expect generous sunshine and excellent visibility. The UV index climbs quickly here even in spring, likely high around the middle of the day, so the sun will feel honest and insistent on bare skin.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant day made for unhurried errands of the spirit: an easy bike roll along the coast while the breeze is still a murmur, a short snorkel in a sheltered cove before the wind ruffles the surface, or simply lingering at a bench with coffee, watching ferries stitch the horizon. Dress light and breathable; add a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and broad-spectrum sunscreen, and consider a long-sleeve layer for the midday hours. By early afternoon, retreat to patches of shade, read a few pages, or wander tide pools without hurry\u2014the kind of day that rewards being outside but measured, letting the bright blue do most of the talking.",
