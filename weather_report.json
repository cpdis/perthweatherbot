    "weather_report": "As the early morning drifts forward in Subiaco, the gentle sound of raindrops lingers in the air, whispering through the streets and lightly kissing the leaves of the eucalyptus trees. A soothing patter accompanies the dim dawn, softening the edges of the world as the sun hesitates behind thick, ambling clouds. The embrace of the sky is a misty grey, drawing a veil over the promise of sunlight, leaving the land with a muted glow and a dampened shine. The UV index nestles low today, permitting only brief, stolen glimpses of light through the breaks in the clouds.\n\nIn these delicate hours, the atmosphere is one of serenity, offering a quietude that hums like a gentle prelude to the symphony of a modest day. A day made for introspective comfort, perhaps, wrapped in a light waterproof jacket or a cozy sweater, allowing the cool air to play around your collar. It is a morning to wander slowly under an umbrella down the quaint streets or to settle into the nook of a favorite caf\u00e9, coffee in hand, to enjoy the tap-tap of rain on the window as an ever-evolving background score to conversations or contemplations. A day inviting not in grandeur but in its calm, fostering moments of peace set against the subtle dynamism of the rain.",
