    "weather_report": "In this radiant afternoon, Downtown San Francisco basks under a gentle sun. The air is crisp, the sky a deep blue canvas unmarred by clouds, presenting a picturesque backdrop against the silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge. With temperatures reaching a pleasant 68 degrees, the warmth invites one outdoors, yet by the afternoon, a slight chill will usher in as the mercury nudges down to 64. A mild breeze, swaying in from the west at 9 to 15 mph, creates a refreshing dance, carrying with it the faint scent of the bay.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clarity remains, devoid of the characteristic fog that often drapes the city. Tonight promises a restful ambiance, with lows settling around a comfortable 52. Though a softer wind will ease into the night, occasionally gusting to 29 mph, the overall atmosphere calls for a light jacket or a cozy sweater as you traverse the streets or enjoy a quiet dinner al fresco. This splendid weather serves as an open invitation to stroll through local parks, perhaps visit a quaint caf\u00e9, or take a leisurely walk along the waterfront, embracing the vibrant urban landscape that glows in the late afternoon light.",
