    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night lingers quietly beneath a partly cloudy sky, wrapping around the cityscape with an embrace of cool air. The temperature rests delicately around 44 degrees, inviting a snug layering of warmth as a gentle breeze whispers through. As dawn approaches, the sun will rise unapologetically, heralding a cheerful day ahead, where golden rays will bask the city in welcoming warmth, pushing the high to a comfortable 60 degrees by midday. The clear skies will shimmer, with a hint of briskness carried by occasional gusts that could sway a street sign or two.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, the fog, like the soft brush of a painter's stroke, gives way to clarity. It may linger along the outskirts, hinting at the ocean\u2019s presence but allows the majestic Golden Gate Bridge to emerge unencumbered\u2014a magnificent sight for any morning wanderer. With such pleasant conditions, it\u2019s a fine opportunity to step outside and embrace the day, perhaps with a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or a quiet moment with coffee on a sun-kissed terrace. A light jacket will serve well, offering just enough warmth against the gentle currents rolling through. For the day ahead, the focus is on serenity and enjoying the beauty that San Francisco so effortlessly offers.",
