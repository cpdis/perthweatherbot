    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle hush blankets the city, with whispers of rain lingering in the air. The clouds play coy, partly obscuring the stars but leaving little hints of clarity in the cool night sky. The mercury dances around a chilly 44 degrees, with hints of a rise to 46 promised as the night deepens. A brisk, northeastern wind rustles through the streets, brushing past the warm glow of urban life, while the chance of precipitation hangs in the balance at a modest 30%. \n\nAs dawn approaches, a sliver of optimism breaks through the forecast. Morning might greet you with scattered raindrops, but this Sunday will reveal hope in the form of sunshine that emerges by the afternoon, allowing the temperatures to hover around a comfortable 56 degrees before giving way to a slight decline. The air will remain fresh, carried by a playful breeze that occasionally flirts with gusts up to 24 mph. Dress in layers\u2014think a cozy sweater paired with a windbreaker\u2014to embrace the mild morning chill and allow for comfortable transitions into the promise of a sunnier afternoon. On this day, perhaps consider a stroll through the neighborhood, exploring little-known caf\u00e9s or charming bookshops, alongside the locals who enjoy the invigorating breeze. The promise of sunshine awaits, beckoning you to savor the city in this tender moment between rain and clarity.",
