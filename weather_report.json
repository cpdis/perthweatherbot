    "weather_report": "Wembley sits under a clean, forgiving sky this early afternoon, the morning\u2019s few clouds long since swept away to leave a bright, steady sun. The light feels cheerful rather than fierce, with a gentle UV that warms the face without biting, and the air has that clear October crispness that sharpens edges and colours. Visibility is excellent; the day looks honest and uncomplicated.\n\nExpect the afternoon to stay mostly bright and settled, a graceful slide toward cooler air once the sun tilts. It\u2019s a day for light layers: a soft sweater or a tidy jacket, sunglasses for the glare, and a dab of sunscreen if you plan to linger. It would suit a slow walk to run an errand, a sandwich at a caf\u00e9 table, or a quiet sit on a bench with a book, letting the sun do small, restorative work. Open a window for a short airing, hang the washing, or take the long way home; it\u2019s pleasant without asking much of you beyond unhurried company.",
