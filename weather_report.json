    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a thick tapestry of clouds rolls in, draping the skyline in varying shades of gray. Showers and thunderstorms are upon us, setting a somber yet captivating mood. The air is alive with the unmistakable scent of impending rain, coupled with gusts that whisper their own raucous tales. Visibility is limited, as the marine layer hovers low, veiling the Golden Gate in a soft, shrouded embrace, while the hills of Marin fade into obscurity. As the rain falls steadily, the streets glisten, reflecting the overhead gloom; this is not a day for sun-soaked strolls but for listening to the symphony of raindrops, perhaps from a cozy caf\u00e9 window with a warming cup in hand.\n\nTonight, the showers will persist, easing only slightly as the temperature finds a mild comfort around 50 degrees. It\u2019s wise to wrap up in layers, choosing a waterproof jacket to fend off the persistent drizzle. Wool or cashmere might serve well beneath, guarding against the cool air that will seep in with the night. For those undeterred by the weather, an evening stroll beneath an umbrella could prove soothing, as the sound of rain mingles with quiet city life and the flickering lights reflect off the damp pavement. A comforting evening awaits, perfect for unhurried conversations or savoring the art of quiet solitude indoors.",
