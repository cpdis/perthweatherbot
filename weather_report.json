With skies this clear, visibility is sharp and the night is uncomplicated. UV is essentially nonexistent now, of course, and the scene invites a quiet dog walk or a moment on the steps to trace constellations before turning in.\n\nYesterday\u2019s forecast showed a clear afternoon, and the pattern looks set to linger into today: a bright, uncomplicated Sunday with plenty of sun and a soft winter angle. Expect a gentle UV bite by midday\u2014low to modest for the season\u2014more a nudge than a hazard, though sunglasses will earn their keep. Dress in layers you can shuffle: a warmer jacket for the early hours, easing to a light sweater by late morning. It\u2019s the kind of day that rewards small errands done on foot, coffee carried to a sunlit bench, a tidy-up in the yard, or washing the car while the sky stays flawlessly blue. Pleasant, unhurried weather, as clear in its intentions as a fresh page.",
