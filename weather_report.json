    "weather_report": "As the late afternoon light begins to surrender to the encroaching clouds, Downtown San Francisco sits veiled in a muted, tranquil gray. The air is thick with the promise of drizzle, casting a subdued atmosphere over the bustling streets. A slight chill drifts in from the south, coaxing pedestrians to pull their jackets a bit tighter around their shoulders. It\u2019s a day that feels like the city is holding its breath, the temperature hovering around the mid-fifties, hinting at the rain that is likely to wash over the scene later in the evening.\n\nAs twilight approaches, a sense of introspection may settle in, the shadows lengthening beneath the dimming skies. The drizzle expected to begin shortly adds a melancholic layer to the usual vibrancy of the city, suggesting that warm tea or coffee would be a comforting companion. A gentle wind whispers through the streets, carrying the scent of the ocean mingled with the earth \u2014 a reminder of the bay's proximity. Layering up with a cozy sweater beneath a light rain jacket would serve well against the evening chill. This is a time best spent exploring cozy cafes, where the warmth inside invites quiet reflection or intimate conversations, all while the rain softly dances against the windows.",
