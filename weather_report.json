Whatever sun slipped through earlier was fleeting, and now the light is muted and pewter, with UV all but gone. The air feels calm and a little solemn; edges blur, shadows lose their bite, and the night arrives without any ceremony. Expect the sky to stay mostly closed, a steady gray companion rather than a threat, with no great drama in the offing.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of night for light layers\u2014a cardigan or a thin jacket\u2014and comfortable shoes if you\u2019re stepping out. A short, unrushed errand fits the mood: a walk to pick up something simple for breakfast, returning the library book that\u2019s been quietly patient, or a slow loop around the block to clear the mind. Indoors, a tidy-up, a pot of tea, and a small plan for tomorrow feel just right. The weather won\u2019t dazzle, but it invites you to move gently, speak softly, and keep your ambitions close to home.",
