    "weather_report": "The dawn of 11th March 2025 began with a velvet stillness in Subiaco, the canvas of night gradually giving way to the insistent nib of daylight. A clear sky prefaced the stewing promise of a splendidly sunny day. Brightness held court significantly making the day one of clarity, almost as if the heavens had decided to take a holiday and in their absence, had left the guardianship of the world to the sun. Unfurled ribbons of sunlight cascaded down, radiating a captivating luminescence onto the serene landscape of this sleepy locale.\n\nThe tone of the day hinted at a pleasingly pleasant weather ahead - a seamlessly gentle blend of the sun's warmth and a breathy, caressing wind to balance it. The UV index remained friendly, ensuring an upbeat mood was soon to become omnipresent. It was a day that merited delightedly light clothing - a soft, pastel sundress or crisply ironed linen shirts - comfortable companions to a radiant sun hat and perhaps, a pair of trusted aviators. How marvellous it would be to find a cosy spot in a park, preferably under the dappled shade of an accommodating tree and whittle the hours away with a favourite book or perhaps even sketch the easy languidness of a vernal Subiaco afternoon.",
