    "weather_report": "In the tranquil suburb of Subiaco, the morning emerges from the cradle of night with a gentle yet persisting drizzle, painting the world outside in soft watercolor hues. The moderate rain, like a maestro conducting a symphony, begins in the early hours and continues its rhythmic patter onto the rooftops, whispering secrets from cloud to leaf. The June air, damp with nostalgia, carries with it a tender chill that snakes around your collar and weaves through the trees, creating an aura of introspection. As you prepare to step outside, it's essential to clothe yourself in layers, perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, and grasp an umbrella as a steadfast companion. \n\nToday's skies, burdened by their watery cargo, forego the solace of sunlight, leaving the UV index at bay, thus casting a gentle veil over the day's activities. It's a time to relish the serene cadence of rain, an invitation to embrace indoor pursuits with gratitude. Perhaps, find solace in the corners of a local caf\u00e9, with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the drumming rain, or wander through a bookstore where the scent of pages becomes a warm embrace against the cool air. For those drawn to more active endeavors, a swim in the community pool offers a delightful contrast to the chilly embrace of rain, where the lapping water becomes your sanctuary. Today, Subiaco's weather crafts a canvas for quiet reflection and subtle pleasures, painting the town in tones of tranquility and gentle contemplation.",
