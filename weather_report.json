    "weather_report": "A gray quilt has been drawn over Katy this morning, and it looks content to linger. From midmorning through noon the clouds hold fast, keeping the sun to a pale suggestion behind the curtain. Expect a soft, even light with little glare and a low UV index; colors will look subdued, edges a little gentler than usual, and visibility otherwise steady. It\u2019s not a dramatic day, just a muted one, the sort that smooths out distractions.\n\nDress in easy layers\u2014a long-sleeve shirt and a light jacket or cardigan should suit the cool, hushed feel\u2014and save the heavy gear for another time. The weather invites errands done unhurriedly, a quiet walk around the block to stretch the legs, a stop at the library, or a late-morning grocery run. If you\u2019re staying in, this is fine light for sorting a drawer, writing a note, or simmering something simple on the stove while the sky keeps its calm.",
