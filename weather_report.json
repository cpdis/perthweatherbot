    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere bears a somber cloak of clouds, heavy with the promise of rain. The cool, muted light filters through a sky draped in shades of gray, casting a reflective melancholy over the city. Though scattered hints of sunlight may occasionally peek through the clouds, their fleeting nature provides little reprieve against the encroaching precipitation. Having already ushered in a damp chill, the afternoon is set to deepen with a steadfast rain expected after four o'clock, saturating the streets with new whispers of life.\n\nIn these moments, one might consider warmly layering up in a lightweight waterproof jacket, perhaps complemented by a comfortable pair of shoes, prepared for the inevitable puddles that will form. The increasing winds, whispering up to 24 mph, suggest that a sturdy umbrella may be wise as evening approaches, heralding a more substantial deluge. It\u2019s a day best spent indoors, perhaps tucked within the cozy confines of a favorite caf\u00e9, sipping a rich brew while observing the city dance through its rain-soaked reveries. One could also lose themselves in the pages of a well-worn book, content to let the world outside blur into a watercolor of grey and movement.",
