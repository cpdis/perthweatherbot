    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Richmond settles under a low quilt of cloud. The morning\u2019s light rain rinsed the streets and the sky never truly brightened; gray hung on, the sun more rumor than presence and the UV gentle enough to forget. The air feels clean but dim, a pewter wash that softens edges and quiets color. Expect the overcast to linger into evening, the day more contemplative than bright, with any leftover damp more like a passing mist than a downpour.\n\nA warm coat, a soft scarf, and comfortable water-resistant shoes fit the mood; keep a small umbrella in your bag just in case. It\u2019s good weather for a short errand loop, a quiet hour in the library stacks, or a gentle stroll to catch the moment when shop windows outshine the sky. Later, let home take over\u2014simmer something simple, sort the mail, and let the gray outside help you focus on small, tidy victories.",
