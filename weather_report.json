    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of fog lingers in the morning light, cloaking the skyline in a ghostly embrace before yielding to the anticipated brightness of the day. The air carries a crispness, invigorated by a gentle north wind that whispers through the streets, hinting at a retreating chill as the sun tries to assert itself above, promising a partly sunny afternoon. Yet, as the daylight wanes and evening draws near, the weather will shift dramatically. Rain is poised to tap softly against windows after ten, heralding the arrival of clouds and a soothing evening drip as the city stirs into its cozy night.\n\nDressing for today calls for layers, a light sweater or stylish jacket to combat the morning chill, with perhaps a scarf to ward off any bite from the breeze. A sturdy umbrella may find its way into the day\u2019s itinerary in anticipation of the evening showers. As the late afternoon beckons, one might stroll through the quieter streets, relish a coffee at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, or visit a local gallery, while the city prepares for its fresh wash of rain\u2014a perfect backdrop for reflective thought or simply watching the world move softly through its fog-draped corners.",
