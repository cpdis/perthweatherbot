    "weather_report": "As the curtains of evening draw close in Subiaco, the melancholy patter of rain has tiptoed into the past, leaving only softly scattered clouds as remnants of the day\u2019s minor tempests. The air, touched by the lingering moisture, carries a subtle coolness, inviting tranquility. Broken clouds, like tattered tapestries of gray, hover across the sky, casting gentle shadows down below, whispering promises of clearer skies as the night deepens. With the sun having retired behind the western horizon, its fiery ardor is replaced by a calmer mood, making the late hours perfect for a leisurely stroll or a contemplative sitting on a veranda with a comforting book as a companion. \n\nDress in layers, perhaps bringing a light sweater to counter any cooling of the evening air, and carry an umbrella just in case those clouds remember how to weep. The low-key ambiance seems to suggest simple, mindful activities: a casual walk to reflect on the day\u2019s memories or perhaps a quiet dinner at an intimate restaurant that offers solace and serene joy. The conditions are mild enough to encourage stepping out without more than a soft precaution. No scorching sun will trouble the skin but cherish the gentle whispers of the evening breeze that promise subtle serenity. As you revel in the sanctuary of the night, know that the day has left a veil of muted promise, forecasting neither worries nor troubles, but a rich canvas painted in subtle hues of respite and calm.",
