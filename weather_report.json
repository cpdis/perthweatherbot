    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Shenton Park arrives polished and cloudless, the sky a taut blue sheet turning slowly to honey. The day has been unabashedly sunny; midday UV would have bitten quickly, and even now the sting lingers, so a hat, sunglasses, and a dab of sunscreen still make sense if you\u2019re out for a while. The air feels dry and clean, edges crisp, with a light breeze that keeps the warmth companionable rather than harsh.\n\nExpect the clear theme to hold through sunset and into a mild, starry evening. It\u2019s pleasant weather for breathable fabrics and easy shoes, with a light layer handy once the sun slips away. These are good hours for ordinary comforts: a loop around Lake Jualbup, a quiet errand on foot, watering the garden, or supper on the balcony while the light fades. If you saved your exercise for later, this is the forgiving window; if you were out at noon, your skin has earned a rest.",
