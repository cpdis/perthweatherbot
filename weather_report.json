    "weather_report": "Morning in Floreat arrives polished and bright, the sky a clean pane of blue with not a cloud to soften the light. Expect the day to stay sun-drenched into early afternoon, with brilliant visibility and crisp horizons. The sun will be fierce; the UV index will surge to very high levels around midday under these clear skies, so the light will feel sharp and relentless in the open, softer and pleasant where there is shade.\n\nDress for radiance: light, breathable fabrics, a wide-brim hat, strong sunglasses, and a faithful coat of sunscreen; carry water and favor the shady side of the street. This is a good window to finish outdoor errands, hang the washing, or take a short, unhurried ride through tree-lined streets before the heat gathers. By lunchtime, let the day slow: a quiet table at a cafe or an hour in the library suits the glare, then perhaps a gentle check of the garden from the porch rather than toiling in it. As the afternoon wears on, keep to cool rooms and patient tasks; later, when the edge softens, a brief stroll will feel like a small reward.",
