    "weather_report": "As evening unfurls upon Downtown San Francisco, the air is imbued with a gentle chill, whispering of rain that won't quite take hold until later. The sky hangs mostly obscured, a blanket of clouds softening the city\u2019s contours and dimming the brilliance of urban lights. Tonight, a stray shower may dance through the streets, though the likelihood remains slight, teasing our senses with just a hint of moisture that evaporates before leaving its mark. With temperatures settling around a cool 52 degrees, a light wind stirs at 2 to 13 mph, sweeping in from the southwest, urging you to consider an extra layer as you step out.\n\nTomorrow promises a more substantial turn as rain showers take center stage. A predominantly cloudy canvas will yield to moments of brightness, inviting a fleeting glimpse of the sun, only to retreat into the embrace of gray. Expect the day to cool to around 55, squeezing the last remnants of warmth from the afternoon. As you prepare for the day ahead, honor the fluidity of this weather\u2014layers are key. A well-chosen light raincoat will serve you well, paired with a comfortable pair of shoes suited for trickier footing on the wet pavement. While the forecast may not promise ideal conditions for a stroll along the bay, it is well-suited for cozying up in a local caf\u00e9 or unwinding with a good book indoors, where you can let the rhythmic sound of rain create a soothing backdrop for an evening well spent.",
