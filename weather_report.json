    "weather_report": "In the early hours of a gray San Francisco morning, a whisper of precipitation dances in the air, casting a shroud of dampness that clings to the city. Soft clouds blanket the sky, hinting at the promise of rain with temperatures nudging around fifty-five degrees that will slowly rise to the fifty-seventh mark. An invigorating wind from the west-southwest has picked up, rustling through the streets with gusts that reach up to thirty-one miles per hour, creating a brisk ambiance that may nudge you to pull your coat a little closer.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the chance of rain lingers, especially before the sun fully rises. The skies will remain mostly cloudy, shedding a soft light over the iconic cityscape. With temperatures expected to hover near fifty-nine, then gently dip in the afternoon, it may feel considerably cooler against the backdrop of the ever-watchful marine layer cloaked in mist, offering a delicate ballet between clarity and haze. This weather calls for a blend of comfort and resilience; a warm scarf and a sturdy umbrella will serve you well. In the midst of this elusive calm, consider meandering through the fog-laden streets or perhaps enjoying a quiet morning coffee in one of the vibrant local caf\u00e9s. Such a day is perfect for introspection or for catching up on that book you've been meaning to dive into, as the city exhales in gentle anticipation of the rain.",
