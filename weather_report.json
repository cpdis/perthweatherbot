Although the city remains void of fog tonight, a subtle chill lingers, urging residents to embrace layered attire\u2014a simple, lightweight jacket paired with a cozy scarf could make all the difference against the cool breeze. \n\nCome Saturday, the sun will stretch its golden arms across the skyline, promising a cheerful day ahead with temperatures peaking around 62, easing slightly later in the afternoon. The north wind will intensify, rustling the leaves and sending a hint of refreshment through the streets. It\u2019ll be a splendid opportunity to enjoy a leisurely walk along the waterfront or perhaps indulge in a quiet moment at one of the many inviting caf\u00e9s. Whether it\u2019s sipping artisan coffee while watching the city weave its daily tale, or simply soaking in the sunny warmth, the day beckons with a freshness that speaks to the soul, inviting both the delight of exploration and the solace of reflection in this vibrant urban landscape.",
