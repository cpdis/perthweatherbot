    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night air carries a crisp clarity, the kind that invites late-night contemplations and starlit wanderings. Currently, the temperature hovers around the mid-forties and will gently warm to near 48 as nighttime stretches peacefully into dawn. The north-northeast breeze brushes past, a soft whisper of coolness\u2014perfect for those wrapped in lightweight layers, perhaps a soft scarf entwined with a favorite jacket, feeling warm yet unburdened.\n\nAs Thursday unfolds, the city will greet the sun with a vivid embrace, promising a high of sixty-three, though afternoon will bring a slight descent as temperatures settle. There is little hint of fog to obscure the skyline, with the morning sun's clarity allowing for a delightful panorama that beckons one to explore the charming streets. It feels like an ideal time for a leisurely stroll by the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s, where one can savor the morning\u2019s first cup of coffee while watching the world awaken. With such inviting conditions, one might find pleasure in slight adventures, whether that be visiting the historic pier or simply absorbing the artful bustle of the city more closely.",
