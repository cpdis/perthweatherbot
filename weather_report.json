    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past midnight, San Francisco lies draped under a thick shroud of clouds, wrapping the city in a muted embrace. The rain, a gentle but persistent companion, dances against windows, whispering secrets of the night to anyone who dares to listen. The air is cool, with a bracing chill that hints at the moisture swirling through the atmosphere. Early risers will face a day steeped in gray, as the forecast promises no respite from the rain that\u2019s expected to linger throughout, even intensifying as the hours slip by.\n\nWith rainfall amounts likely to accumulate significantly, the bustling streets of Downtown may be washed into a quieter, more contemplative rhythm. Visibility will be compromised, particularly when looking out towards the usual landmarks, where the marine layer will blanket views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the hills beyond. Those venturing out should consider comfortable layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy raincoat paired with water-resistant boots and an umbrella to combat the relentless drizzle. It might be an ideal day to savor the joy of steaming coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9, losing oneself in a book or engaging in quiet conversation, embracing the slower pulse of the city. Whether meandering through art galleries or indulging in culinary delights inside, today holds the promise of stillness amidst the natural cadence of rainfall and clouds.",
