    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco evokes a contemplative spirit, as the city is enveloped in a thick veil of rain-soaked clouds. The persistent sound of droplets tapping against windows and pavements fills the air, casting a gentle reminder of nature\u2019s rhythm. As temperatures settle around the mid-50s, the winds from the south urge you to zip up and draw your collar close, for the chill bites subtly yet insistently.\n\nAs night descends, the rain continues to weave its narrative\u2014a nocturnal tapestry of shiny streets reflecting the softened glow of streetlights. Clarity is surrendered to the fog, merging land and sea into a misty embrace, where the iconic Golden Gate Bridge lurks in its shrouded majesty. With visibility compromised, one might find the evening best suited for the intimate corners of a caf\u00e9 or the inviting warmth of a bookstore, where the world feels a tad more approachable. A cozy sweater, a reliable umbrella, and an adventurous spirit in seeking shelter could be the perfect attire for this soggy urban experience. The rain may conspire to dampen outdoor plans, but in its persistent fall lies an invitation to pause, reflect, and indulge in the simple pleasures of warmth and comfort.",
