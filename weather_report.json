    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a clear, sunny sky, promising a day that feels refreshingly crisp and invigorating. A gentle northwest breeze carries a hint of coolness, setting the stage for high temperatures that will dance around the 59-degree mark before softly descending into the afternoon. As the day progresses and the sun bathes the city in its luminous embrace, you might feel the temperature dip slightly, settling into the mid-50s\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll along the bustling streets, where the vibrancy of city life thrives.\n\nTonight, the air will turn cooler still, with clear skies and nighttime temperatures grazing the 46-degree point. A north northwest wind will whisper through the streets, its briskness serving as a reminder of the seasonal transition. For those venturing out, light layers\u2014a cozy sweater or a light jacket\u2014will offer comfort without the bulk, ideal for enjoying an evening coffee or catching up with friends over a relaxed meal. With such splendid weather, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or a slow walk by the waterfront could weave delightful threads into your day\u2019s tapestry, while the absence of fog allows the stunning vistas of the Golden Gate and city skyline to be fully appreciated.",
