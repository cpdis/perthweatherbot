    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a clear, tranquil night, the sky polished and still, with stars unblinking over quiet streets. Toward dawn the clarity holds, promising a bright, uncomplicated morning and plenty of sunshine once the sun edges up; UV will build after sunrise, so plan shade and a hat if you\u2019ll be out later. It feels pleasantly cool now, the sort of air that suggests a light jumper or cardigan if you\u2019re stepping onto the veranda, then breathable layers for the early commute. This is good weather for small, steady things: set the kettle for tomorrow\u2019s first cup, lay out what you need for the morning, or take a brief, unhurried walk to clear the mind. At first light, a gentle stretch on the patio, a quick sweep of the garden, or an early grocery run will fit the mood of a crisp, cloudless start.",
