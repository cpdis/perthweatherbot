    "weather_report": "As the early light of day breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a soft haze hangs in the air, attesting to the moisture gathered overnight. The skyline, veiled by a marine layer, resonates with the promise of rain later in the day. While morning breezes gently whisper through the streets, they carry with them the scent of impending showers, setting the stage for a transformation from a mostly sunny morning into a more somber, rain-soaked afternoon. Current temperatures hover at a cool 50, yet a gradual shift is expected, paving the way for a high that flirts with 59 before sliding back down into the evening chill. \n\nAs the clouds thicken and the certainty of rainfall increases, those venturing out may wish to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or cardigan paired with a water-resistant jacket to keep the dampness at bay. The sweater will serve well against the brisk breeze, and the jacket will be essential as the skies open up later this evening. This transitional weather invites opportunities for cozy pursuits: consider revisiting your favorite caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or if the rain holds off long enough, enjoy a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the tranquility of the bay meets the rhythm of droplets that may soon dance upon the pavement.",
