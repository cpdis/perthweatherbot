    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a gentle veil of clouds, creating a soft, muted canvas above. The air is crisp, hovering around 46 degrees, with early hints of warmth promising to rise as the sun takes charge. By midday, expect sunshine to dominate the skies, transforming the cool morning into a pleasantly breezy afternoon, tempering the high near 62 degrees. The northeast winds will flirt with you at about 9 mph, occasionally gusting up to 20, adding a touch of invigorating chill to the serene atmosphere.\n\nCurrently, the horizon holds a subtle haze, suggesting the remnants of a marine layer that might still linger near the coast, particularly toward the Golden Gate Bridge. It invites a contemplative stroll along the waterfront, where the reflections of the city dance upon the bay\u2019s gentle ripples. As the day progresses, the clarity should improve, revealing the landmark beauty of this iconic place. A light jacket will suffice for any outdoor activity, perhaps a relaxed coffee on a sunlit patio or a leisurely walk through one of the city\u2019s many stunning parks. For those seeking a sense of connection with nature, the crisp air and warm sun provide the perfect backdrop for moments of quiet reflection or simple joy.",
