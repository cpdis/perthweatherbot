    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a flawless blue canopy at midday, the sun crisp and insistent, shadows trimmed to sharp edges. It is very sunny now and, in this spring light, the UV is likely fierce through the early afternoon before softening later. The air feels clean and open, the sort of clarity that makes colors pop and the day seem newly washed. Expect the sky to stay clear through the afternoon and into early evening, trading glare for a mellow, honeyed glow.\n\nDress for brightness: light, breathable layers, sunglasses with real intent, a brimmed hat, and a generous sweep of sunscreen. Carry water and let your pace be unhurried. This is a good afternoon for small errands on foot, pausing under shopfront awnings, or for hanging the washing and tending balcony herbs. If you\u2019re restless, save the longer walk or a gentle cycle to the grocer for mid to late afternoon when the light eases and the streets feel unhurried.",
