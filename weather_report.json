    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a soft drizzle\u2014a steady rain that kisses the pavement, creating a gentle rhythm against the night. The air hangs pleasantly cool, hovering around the low fifties, with a sultry warmth whispering promises of a slight rise as the hours slip by. The clouds, heavy and brooding, have woven themselves into a thick veil, obscuring the stars and wrapping the city in a blanket of moisture. The chance of precipitation stands unwaveringly at one hundred percent, ensuring that this night is an intimate one, perfect for cozy indoor pursuits.\n\nWhile tomorrow beckons with the possibility of sunlight peeking through, rain continues to be the dominant theme. Expect only a flirtation with brightness as temperatures gently hover around fifty-eight before retreating. The southwest winds, a mild presence at six to nine mph, may bring a soothing rustle, but their gusts may knock playfully against the eaves, hinting at the day's transition. Dressed in layers\u2014perhaps a light waterproof jacket over a comfortable sweater\u2014and armed with a sturdy umbrella, one can embrace the whimsical weather. The cityscape appears blurry and ethereal, yet inviting; a perfect backdrop for a quiet evening spent with a good book or sipping warm tea in the comfort of home. For those adventurous souls, a stroll through dampened streets, illuminated by the soft glow of street lamps, offers a serene escape, allowing the serenity of the rain-soaked night to wash away the bustle of everyday life.",
