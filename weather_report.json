    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a calm night, the sky mostly clear and clean, with stars sharp at the edges and only a few clouds expected to drift in toward the small hours. The sun is gone and with it the bite; UV is negligible now and will stay that way until dawn, when the light returns quickly and, even with patchy cloud, the UV will build fast through the morning. It feels like a night for ease: a light layer over short sleeves, something comfortable if you wander out for a last errand or to water the pots, windows cracked to let in the cooler air. Set out tomorrow\u2019s things, take a short, unhurried walk around the block, or read a few pages on the balcony. Early risers might enjoy a quiet spin or walk at first light before the day brightens and the sun turns more insistent.",
