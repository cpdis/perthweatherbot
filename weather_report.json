    "weather_report": "As night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a persistent, gentle rain blankets the city, wrapping it in a cool embrace. The clouds hang low, creating a moody atmosphere that might dissuade the unprepared, but for the adventurous, it beckons with an intimate charm. With temperatures hovering around the mid-fifties, the evening is marked by a spiraling wind, whispering through the streets, punctuated by occasional gusts that spin fallen leaves in a playful dance. Visibility is reduced, draping everything in a soft, diffused light that blurs the outlines of buildings and gives the bridges a ghostly allure.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the rain will linger until the morning rush, yielding to scattered showers and possibly a thunderstorm before breaking into the promise of sunshine. As the day unfolds and temperatures cool slightly, the brisk west wind will add a fresh edge to the air, perfect for those who relish a brisk walk. Whether exploring the diverse boutiques along Valencia Street or indulging in a warm coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9, proper attire will be essential. A well-worn raincoat, sturdy boots to navigate the slick streets, and maybe an umbrella for good measure will enhance the day, inviting you to embrace the city\u2019s inherent beauty even in dreary weather. As nightfall flares to life, consider a stroll along the waterfront\u2014its ethereal charm is magnified when rain meets city lights, turning the ordinary into moments of unexpected pleasure.",
