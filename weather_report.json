    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night reveals itself, blanketing the city in a gentle stillness. The air is cool, whispering a serene promise as it hovers around 45 degrees. A light westerly breeze brushes past, unburdened, as if it carries the secrets of the bay. The dawn anticipates an awakening to a sunlit day, where hues of gold and warmth will herald a high nearing 59. Yet, as afternoon unfolds, the temperature gracefully dips towards 56, inviting a sense of transition. \n\nThe skyline stretches upwards, punctuated by the dim, twinkling lights of the city, hinting at a clear expanse overhead, absent of the fog that often drapes San Francisco in its soft embrace. While the marine layer remains distant, it casts no shadow on the day to come, leaving clarity for those wishing to enjoy the views. As you step outside, consider a light jacket to fend off the early chill, perfect for an invigorating stroll through a nearby park or perhaps a leisurely coffee at a caf\u00e9 where the ambiance hums with soft conversations. The day is poised to offer quiet pleasures, allowing each moment to unfold like the petals of a sunlit bloom.",
