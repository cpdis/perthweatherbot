The sun shines generously, though the clouds are beginning their slow ascent, creating a textured scenic beauty that hints at the day\u2019s impending transformation. Visibility remains high, with distant landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge framing the skyline. Yet, there's a touch of melancholy as the marine layer lingers at the edges, softening the horizon and blurring the line where the sky meets the bay.\n\nAs evening draws near, expect the clouds to gather more earnestly, settling in with a low of about 46\u2014just ample enough for a light jacket or a cozy sweater. Whether it\u2019s a brisk walk through the neighborhoods, a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 for a seasonal brew, or simply enjoying the vibrant art scene in the Mission, today calls for modest plans yet still offers moments of delight. To enjoy the cool, fresh air, consider layering your attire, ensuring comfort as the winds shift gently from the north-northeast.
