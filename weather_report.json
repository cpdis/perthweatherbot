    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle may kiss the city until the break of dawn, giving way to the ever-lurking chance of rain. The streets, already bathed in the muted glow of streetlights, feel the stirring of a soft south wind, lightly stirring leaves and whispers alike. Beneath a mostly cloudy sky, temperatures hover around a cool 54, a sign to grab a light jacket that can fend off the dampness. As the hours move towards morning, the landscape grows shrouded in a veil of clouds, while the air carries a delicate scent of impending precipitation, a reminder of nature's subtle artistry in a place known for its moody weather.\n\nTomorrow, Veterans Day promises a shift, with rain likely to arrive before the afternoon heralds the chance of drizzle again. Clouds will reign overhead, casting a somber yet cozy ambiance across the urban expanse. Expect highs approaching 61, before slipping gently toward 56 as the day unfolds, all while a brisk wind from the west southwest accentuates the atmospheric chill. With a strong likelihood of rain adding a melodic tap against windows, it seems a perfect day for engaging in quieter pursuits indoors. Consider visiting a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm brew while watching the world bloom and blur through the window as droplets race down the glass. Engaging in the simple pleasure of a book or perhaps getting lost in conversation can be deeply satisfying on a day such as this, where the landscapes might seem dreary but offer an intimate backdrop for moments of reflection and warmth.",
