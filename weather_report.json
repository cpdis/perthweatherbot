    "weather_report": "Belmont eases into late afternoon under a mostly open sky, just a few clouds drifting like friendly afterthoughts. The light is generous but softening now, the sting of midday UV already ebbing; earlier would have been bright and rather strong, but at this hour the sun is mellow and the air looks clear and clean\u2014good sightlines, crisp edges, little haze. Expect the rest of the day to stay settled and fair, with gentle color deepening toward evening.\n\nDress for easy comfort: breathable layers, sunglasses still worth keeping on hand, and a hat or a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger outdoors before sunset. It\u2019s the kind of weather that flatters unhurried errands\u2014walk to pick up a loaf of bread, water the garden, or take a quiet loop around the block to stretch the workday out of your shoulders. If you\u2019ve a park bench within reach, bring a slim paperback and let the long shadows do their work.",
