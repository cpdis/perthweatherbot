The night\u2019s chill lingers, with temperatures nudging around 46 degrees, a gentle reminder that winter is firm in its grasp. As the day unfolds, warmer currents promise to coax the mercury up to a cooler yet comfortable 56. Winds whisper softly from the north, carrying with them the clear intentions of a mostly sunny day ahead. \n\nAs the sun rises higher, fog is but a fleeting specter, retreating to the peripheries, leaving behind a crisp clarity that invigorates the senses. It\u2019s a splendid opportunity to embrace the outdoors; a stroll through Golden Gate Park or a quiet moment perched by the waterfront feels particularly inviting. Those venturing out should reach for layers\u2014a light jacket paired with a cozy sweater offers warmth against the morning\u2019s crispness while remaining breathable enough for the midday sun. With the gentle breeze accompanying your jaunt, don\u2019t forget a scarf or a hat, should the wind decide to swirl, just enough to remind you of the bay\u2019s enchanting embrace.",
