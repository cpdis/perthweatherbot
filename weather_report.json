    "weather_report": "Subiaco steps into early afternoon under a friendly scatter of cloud, the sun slipping through with easy confidence and sharpening the edges of shadows. The air looks clean and far-seeing, a clear-window sort of day, with brightness that feels honest rather than harsh. UV will be punchy around the midday hours despite the season, the kind that asks for sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen, and then eases as the light slides toward late afternoon.\n\nExpect the sky to simplify as the hours pass, from scattered to just a few clouds by late day, giving the afternoon a more open, sun-forward feel without turning brassy. It reads as comfortably mild in the shade and a touch warm where the sun lingers. Light layers will suit you best, with a brimmed hat for the stroll and a spare sweater for dusk. Consider a walk to a late lunch, a quiet coffee at a sidewalk table, errands done on foot, or a small ritual like hanging laundry to drink in the breeze. A short spin through Kings Park or a book on a bench before the golden hour would fit the mood neatly.",
