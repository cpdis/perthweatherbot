    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a clean, enamel-blue sky at midday, the kind of late-spring clarity that makes edges sharp and colors ring. The sun is unfiltered and assertive, with UV running very high through the early afternoon, so skin and eyes will need armor: sunscreen, a brim, good sunglasses. The air feels dry and uncomplicated, inviting if you keep to the shade.\n\nThe forecast keeps the day steady and bright, with clear skies carrying through the afternoon into early evening. Expect a pleasant softening of heat and light toward late day; that\u2019s the moment for unhurried errands on foot, a quiet coffee under an awning on Rokeby Road, or a book on a shaded balcony with a glass of cold water nearby. Dress light and breathable, sleeves if you\u2019re lingering outdoors, and save any longer strolls or a lap around the oval for when the sun tilts west and shadows lengthen. It\u2019s a simple, handsome day\u2014best enjoyed in measured doses.",
