    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a scrubbed, blue-black sky tonight; the forecast holds it clear through late evening and into the small hours. The sun has bowed out and with it the UV, leaving a gentle dark with crisp edges and good visibility. If these bare skies greet the dawn, expect a frank, generous light and UV that wakes quickly with the morning, the kind that asks for shade and a brim.\n\nIt feels like a night for light layers: a tee with a soft cardigan if you linger outdoors, easy shoes for a short amble to clear the head. Leave the heavy coat on the hook. Good uses of the hour are simple ones\u2014air the house a little, water the pots, fetch a quiet necessity from the corner shop, or take ten unrushed minutes on the balcony with a page and the night\u2019s hush. If you\u2019re staging tomorrow, set out a hat and sunscreen, and plan the sun-facing errands early before the light turns insistent.",
