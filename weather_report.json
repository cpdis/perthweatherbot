    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Bend under a quilt of broken clouds, the light thinning to a pewter glow with almost no sunshine left to give and a UV index all but nonexistent. The air feels wintry and clean, the horizons softened, details of ridge and pine smudged as if sketched in charcoal. It\u2019s a quiet mood rather than a sparkling one, more candlelit than crystalline.\n\nAs night comes on, those clouds are expected to knit into a full overcast, making the hours ahead calm and muted rather than sharp or bright. Dress for the chill: a warm coat, hat, gloves, and sturdy shoes, with a scarf if you\u2019re out walking after dinner. It\u2019s a good evening for small, ordinary comforts\u2014take a gentle loop around the neighborhood before the sky closes, then duck into a bookstore or a calm cafe, or head home to brew tea, sort the mail, and set out tomorrow\u2019s gear. The weather invites unhurried tasks and the simple pleasure of being indoors while the town grows quiet.",
