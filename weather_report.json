    "weather_report": "The dawn of San Francisco today bathes the city in a gentle golden light, revealing the sunlit contours of its famous skyline. With temperatures hovering in the low sixties, it feels fresh and invigorating outside, the kind of briskness that sharpens the senses. A north-northeast breeze carries whispers of the coastal air, steady enough to tousle the leaves but not fierce enough to chill the bones, only enhancing the day\u2019s inviting nature. As the afternoon approaches, the warmth will linger before gracefully giving way to the cooler embrace of the evening, where a few clouds will dot the sky, adding just a hint of mystery to the twilight.\n\nFor those stepping outside, layering is the answer; a lightweight jacket paired with a breathable sweater will offer comfort in the changing temperatures. The morning air feels clear, with little to no fog obscuring the view, allowing the golden rays to define the city's architectural marvels and natural beauty. This is a perfect opportunity for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the local cafes that are just starting to awaken. Alternatively, finding a spot in a sun-drenched park with a good book could be the ideal way to savor the present moment. Whether it\u2019s exploring the storied streets or simply enjoying the beauty around, today promises to be a pleasant chapter in the city\u2019s ever-evolving narrative.",
