    "weather_report": "This morning in Downtown San Francisco, the sky hangs heavy with the promise of rain, obscuring the once-vibrant landmarks with a sodden shroud. The air feels rich and damp, imbued with the unmistakable scent of wet earth and impending storms. As the clock ticks toward midday, a steady parade of rain is expected to cloak the streets, accompanied by thunder that may rattle windows and fill the air with a sense of unease. The chill lingers around 55 degrees, not quite cold enough to encourage layers but definitely enough to don a light waterproof jacket to keep the moisture at bay.\n\nAs day transitions into night, the showers will continue, inviting the well-prepared individual to find solace indoors. The recommended attire leans toward the practical: perhaps a cozy sweater beneath that waterproof shell, paired with sturdy shoes to navigate the slick sidewalks. While the elements may not favor outdoor ventures today, perhaps an afternoon spent in a snug caf\u00e9, sipping a well-crafted espresso while watching the droplets race down the window, would be a delightful alternative. Or, if venture calls, an amble through the wet streets wrapped in your favorite coat could reveal the city's more subdued beauty.",
