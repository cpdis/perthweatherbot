    "weather_report": "As dawn glides over Subiaco, the skies remain solemnly draped in a palette of muted grays, whispering the dampened echoes of the night's moderate rain. The early hours bring a fresh coolness, the air carrying the earthy scent of the soaked terrain calming the world to its gentle rhythm. This morning belongs to the rain, with sun merely a shy companion today, lurking behind thick clouds with little chance of emerging to grace the day with its luminous presence. The UV index, cloaked in this cocoon of clouds, promises mercy, permitting an unguarded walk beneath the trees if the droplets cease. Expect a day veiled in softer hues, where clarity gives way to a dreamy blurriness, perfect for quiet reflection or losing oneself in a well-loved novel. Dress in layers that shield against the lingering chill, slipping on an enduring pair of wellies to dance between raindrops. This day invites slow-paced wandering through serene moments\u2014perfect perhaps for a dewy stroll through Adelaide Terrace or settling in with a warm mug cradled in your hands, contemplating the pitter-patter symphony that nature conducts outside. Time passes leisurely here in Subiaco; relish its gentleness, pause and breathe in the simple pleasures of a time untethered by pressing pursuits.",
