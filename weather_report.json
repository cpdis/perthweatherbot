    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere embraces a calm clarity, as the soft night reveals itself under a mostly clear sky, temperatures dipping gently to around 42 degrees. A delicate south wind whispers through the streets at a mere three mph, inviting wanderers to take a peaceful stroll through the city, perhaps along the waterfront, where the lights shimmer on the bay, reflecting the tranquil essence of the evening.\n\nLooking forward to Tuesday, the sun will grace the day with its warmth, ascending to a high of 56 before retreating slightly into the afternoon. A light breeze from the east northeast, fluttering at 2 to 7 mph, will offer a pleasant accompaniment to your endeavors. While fog typically swathes the coast, it seems absent for now, allowing the iconic skyline to stand boldly against the bright blue backdrop. A light jacket or sweater would suffice as the day's charm unfolds, making it perfect for a leisurely brunch at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 or a visit to one of the city\u2019s many parks, where the vibrancy of life harmonizes with the crisp air. This day beckons one to embrace the pulse of San Francisco, finding joy in the simple beauty of an everyday moment.",
