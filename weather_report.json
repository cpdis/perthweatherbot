    "weather_report": "As the sun sinks behind the hills of San Francisco, the evening ushers in an embrace of moisture-laden air. Currently, a veil of clouds hangs over the city, hinting at the rain that swept through earlier. The streets may be glistening from a recent shower, yet the night holds a promise of a break in the precipitation, with only a chance of drizzle lingering in the air. The coolness brushes against your skin, a gentle invitation to layer up against the evening chill. Expect temperatures to hover around the mid-fifties, with a brisk wind adding to the crispness of the night.\n\nTomorrow, the skies are set to clear, allowing glimpses of sunny delight. A gentle warmth will emerge, peaking at around 62 degrees, bringing with it the perfect opportunity for gentle strolls through local parks or quiet caf\u00e9s. The marine layer will likely dance just above the bay, casting a mystic glow across the landscape, especially near the iconic bridge. This transitional weather calls for light layers\u2014perhaps a soft sweater to combat the morning's chill, giving way to a lighter jacket for the afternoon sun. Consider a leisurely visit to a nearby art gallery or an unhurried afternoon at a local bookstore, where the quiet ambiance matches the tranquil weather. The city's pulse continues, inviting exploration in its cool embrace.",
