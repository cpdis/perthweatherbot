    "weather_report": "The sky hangs heavy over Downtown San Francisco, a thick blanket of clouds obscuring any promise of sunlight. The rain has begun to fall, adding a quiet rhythm to the city's pulse, with expectations of heavier showers drenching the streets as the day unfolds. The atmosphere is thick with moisture, and the high's barely grazes the mid-fifties, barely nudging upwards as temperatures cling to the chill of the air. As gusts sweep through, they bring a chill that slices through even the sturdiest of layers, underscoring the urgency of dressing warmly\u2014a weathered trench coat, sturdy boots, and perhaps an umbrella, not for style, but for necessity.\n\nVisibility is compromised by the gathering gloom, a thick marine layer rolling in from the ocean, shrouding the Golden Gate and muffling the city's vibrant vibrancy. The typical bright hues of the urban landscape fade into a muted palette, inviting those indoors to revel in the comfort of warm drinks and soft conversations. It\u2019s a day best suited for exploring the quiet corners of local cafes or indulging in the allure of a good book beneath the protective cover of a soft blanket. As daylight dwindles into the night, the rain is set to continue, with expectations of more drumming against windows, creating a cocoon of warmth for those fortunate enough to be indoors.",
