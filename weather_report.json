    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives under a quilt of broken cloud, the sun slipping through like a hand opening and closing over a lantern. Light is bright but softened, the sort of day where edges look gentler, though the UV still bites in the early afternoon despite the interruptions overhead. It feels like a warm, workable day: mostly dry, a little shifting shade, the promise of a sea breeze later to lift the leaves and your mood.\n\nDress for easy movement and sun sense: a breathable shirt, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and sunscreen you actually reapply. If you\u2019re out now, keep to the shadier side of the street; save the linger-and-loaf for mid to late afternoon when the sky steadies and the light grows honeyed. It\u2019s a good day for small errands, a quiet browse in a bookshop, or a late lunch on a verandah. As the breeze freshens, take an unhurried walk through a leafy street or tend to the garden, letting the patchwork sky do its modest theatre above you.",
