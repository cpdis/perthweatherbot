The night sky, mostly clear, offers glimpses of stars peppering the vast darkness, making it a welcoming sight for those who pause to admire the view. With temperatures drifting into the low 40s, there\u2019s a coolness to the air that invites you to wrap yourself in layers, perhaps a warm jacket or a light scarf paired with comfortable shoes for a stroll along the waterfront.\n\nTomorrow promises to be mostly sunny, its brightness tempered by the crispness of late December. The forecast hints at a high in the low 50s, making it a day well-suited for both thoughtful reflection and gentle outdoor activities. As the sun rises, the clarity of the day may reveal the iconic silhouettes of the city framed against clear skies, although there might be a stray whisper of fog hovering at the edges, a characteristic feature of this urban landscape. Such conditions beckon one to leisurely explore, whether it\u2019s a walk through a quiet neighborhood, a visit to a thoughtfully curated caf\u00e9, or an afternoon spent perusing the local bookstores that breathe life into the city\u2019s rhythm. \n\nFor a Sunday adventure amidst the city\u2019s allure, layering clothes will ensure comfort, allowing you to fully embrace the day, whatever it may bring.",
