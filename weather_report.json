    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Katy under a shifting quilt of broken clouds, the last scraps of twilight giving way to a muted, pewter sky. By late evening the ceiling thickens to a full overcast, the city\u2019s lights reflecting softly against it. There\u2019s no sun to speak of now, and the UV index is essentially asleep; even early tomorrow looks reluctant to brighten quickly if the cloud layer lingers. The night feels calm and orderly, the horizon blurred just enough to make the world seem gentler and close at hand.\n\nExpect a quiet, gray-tinged night rather than drama. If you step out, a light jacket or soft sweater will suit the mood; long sleeves make sense for an unhurried dog walk or a last circuit around the block. It\u2019s good weather for small, useful comforts: tidying a room, prepping tomorrow\u2019s breakfast, skimming a few chapters, or making a short drive to return a library book before the week reawakens. The sky may not dazzle, but it invites a slower rhythm and thoughts that don\u2019t have to hurry.",
