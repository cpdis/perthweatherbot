    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco sits under a polished blue, the day steady and cloudless; the sun still lively but softening, its UV slipping from the midday sting to something gentler. Expect the sky to stay clear into evening, the light falling through amber to indigo and the air turning calmly cool, with no hint of rain. It feels pleasant more than punishing. Dress lightly for now, sunglasses and a brim if you\u2019re out before dusk, then a spare layer for the first cool breath after sunset. These are hours made for ordinary comforts: a slow walk to fetch something for supper, watering the garden, a quiet lap of the oval, or reading on the verandah as the day exhales.",
