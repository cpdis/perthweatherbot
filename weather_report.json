The high temperature reaches a comfortable 60 degrees, with a soft, cool breeze whispering through the streets, offering just enough respite against the latefall air. As the afternoon progresses, expect temperatures to dip slightly, inviting a jacket or light sweater for those who venture outdoors. \n\nTonight, clouds will begin to gather, murmuring softly of the chill that will settle in, leading to a low of 46. The winds will remain unassuming, blowing from the north-northeast at around 7 mph, maintaining an airy yet crisp ambiance. The clarity of the day remains unmarred by the fog that often blankets this area, leaving the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge sharply defined against the backdrop of blue skies. For those looking to make the most of this delightful day, an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely visit to a neighborhood caf\u00e9 might be just the remedy, allowing one to soak in the serene charm of the city as it transitions towards evening.",
