    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Katy with a polished, cloudless sky, the kind that sharpens the edges of rooftops and lets the first stars gather without fuss. The air feels clean and unhurried, visibility crisp, and the UV index effectively asleep for the night. Expect that same clear tenor through midnight, a quietly pleasant scene for a short walk with the dog, an unhurried grocery dash, or a little porch time to breathe between holidays. A light jacket or soft sweater will suit the cooler night air; comfortable shoes and an easy pace complete the picture.\n\nIf these clear skies hold, dawn should arrive bright and uncomplicated, the sun stepping in without ceremony. Early UV will remain low at first light, then build to typical winter levels as the morning matures, so sunglasses will earn their keep by mid-morning. Plan for simple, useful errands, a coffee on the patio, or a window-cracked commute with a favorite song\u2014nothing grand, just the small satisfactions of a clear start.",
