    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a rinsed-blue sky, the light already clean and insistent. Forecasts from late morning into early afternoon hold to clear, unblemished skies, the sort that sharpen edges and warm the footpaths. Expect a decidedly sunny day; UV will surge toward the very high around midday, so favor a brimmed hat, sunglasses, airy layers, and sunscreen. It looks pleasantly straightforward, almost crystalline, provided you keep pockets of shade within reach.\n\nNow is a gentle hour for a coffee on a verandah or a stroll beneath the jacarandas before the glare hardens. Run a few errands by foot, hang the washing, or take lunch outside if there\u2019s an awning nearby; if you\u2019re at a desk, crack a window and let the day move through the room. The sky promises clarity rather than drama, a day for simple plans and an unhurried pace.",
