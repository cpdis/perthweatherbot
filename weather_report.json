    "weather_report": "West Perth settles under a clear, quiet sky tonight, the kind that sharpens edges and lets the stars breathe. The forecast keeps it cloudless through late evening and into the small hours, so visibility will be crisp and the air uncomplicated. UV is effectively nil now, and the day\u2019s brightness has slipped into a gentle, inky calm that feels kind to unhurried plans.\n\nOvernight stays serene, and if these clean skies hold to dawn, the sun will stride in quickly; by midmorning in a Perth February, UV typically climbs fast, so plan for shade, sunscreen, and a brimmed hat. It feels like a pleasant night for a slow loop around the block, a quiet sit on the balcony, or tidying the week\u2019s loose ends with a window cracked for the breeze. Dress in light layers\u2014a tee and an easy cardigan if you\u2019re out late; tomorrow, breathable fabrics and sunglasses will be your friends.",
