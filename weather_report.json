    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a polished blue, the kind of clear morning that sharpens edges and quickens errands. At this hour the sun already has some bite, and it will strengthen toward midday; expect a brilliant, cloudless afternoon with long, unwavering light and very high UV around the peak hours. The day looks crisp and uncomplicated, easy to read at a glance: no haze, no threat, just that steady summer glare.\n\nDress light and breathable, with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and generous sunscreen; a loose long sleeve won\u2019t go astray if you\u2019re out around lunch. It\u2019s a good morning for quiet, practical things\u2014walking to the shops before the pavements heat up, airing the house, tending a few balcony plants, or lingering over coffee in the shade. If you feel restless after noon, seek the cool kindness of a gallery or library, then step back out toward late afternoon when the light softens and the streets feel unhurried again.",
