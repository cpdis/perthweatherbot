    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries the scent of impending rain, mingling with the freshness of the coastal breeze. The clouds hang low, wrapping the city in a soft, gray shroud, while the temperature sits comfortably around 56 degrees. If you\u2019re taking a stroll tonight, a light jacket or umbrella will serve you well, for the forecast hints at rain likely, with a 70% chance of a few droplets gracing the pavement as the night deepens. Though the wind is gentle, the atmosphere feels charged with anticipation.\n\nTomorrow brings a subtle shift in the weather. A slight chance of rain lingers in the late afternoon, with a high of 62 degrees, gradually cooling towards an unsettling yet cozy 60. The clouds will continue to dominate the skyline, but a sense of calm accompanies the day, less oppressive than the night. For those venturing out, consider layering your clothing\u2014a light sweater under your jacket will be just right for unpredictable moments. It's a day that invites quiet reflection, perhaps wandering through a nearby caf\u00e9 with a good book or indulging in a leisurely visit to the bustling Ferry Building Marketplace, all perfectly suited to the rhythm of a chilly yet invigorating San Francisco day.",
