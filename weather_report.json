    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is clean and starlit, the kind of stillness that makes small sounds feel important. Forecasts point to a clear run toward the small hours, with only a thin scatter of cloud slipping in before dawn, so the morning should break bright and uncompromised. UV is negligible now, will stay low through first light, then rise quickly once the sun takes command; expect a decidedly sunny feel by midmorning if the sky holds. The air will likely read cool to the skin before sunrise, clear to the eye, and easy to breathe.\n\nDress with layers you can peel away: a light sweater or jacket for the pre-dawn chill, shifting to sleeves you don\u2019t mind rolling up, plus sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen for later. If you\u2019re awake now, this is a good hour for a quiet tea by the window, a stretch, or sketching tomorrow\u2019s list. As the first color washes the streets, consider a slow walk to the bakery, watering the garden, or cycling the back lanes while the light feels new and uncomplicated.",
