    "weather_report": "Evening has folded over Subiaco with an easy calm, the sky mostly clear, only a few wayward clouds drifting like brushstrokes over a darkening blue. The late afternoon and early evening were bright and largely sunny between those clouds, with the UV slipping from mild to negligible as the sun sank; now it\u2019s settled to nothing at all. Air feels clean, visibility sharp, and the night ahead looks steady and quiet under a mostly open sky.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant night to keep it simple: a light jacket or soft sweater will do, and comfortable shoes if you\u2019re stepping out. Consider a short, unhurried walk to shake off the day, a quick run to the corner shop, or a seat by an open window with something warm to drink while the last of the dusk thins out. If you\u2019ve errands to tie up, the weather won\u2019t argue; if you\u2019ve none, the clear night invites a little unrushed looking up.",
