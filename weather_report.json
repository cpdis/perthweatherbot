    "weather_report": "Subiaco under the ethereal canvas of a clear sky presents an inextinguishable allure. It is the wee hours of the second day of March. The enveloping serenity crafts an intricate chiaroscuro of radiance and shadows, inviting a calm just before the city fully springs to life. The day savors an expanse of crisp clarity, unblemished by any dots of threatening clouds.\n\nAs the day poised towards dawn, the weather predictions hold a prism of delightful possibilities. We can anticipate a refreshing embrace of sunlight, designed delicately for those who endeavor to emerge and relish the unfolding day. Judicious layering of light clothing would serve well to both appreciate the warmth of the sun and cater for the cool air of the early morning. A novel waiting to be devoured in a spot mildly kissed by the sun would lend the perfect harmony to blend with the charm of Subiaco's weather. Leisurely strolls, or the warm company of a loved one over a cup of morning warmth, might just be the perfect ode to such a radiantly clear day.",
