    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a pewter lid, the light soft and undecided, streets rinsed in a gentle gray. At this hour the sun is a rumor behind cloud, UV low and unthreatening, and the air feels calm rather than cold. Through the morning the ceiling looks set to hold\u2014muted brightness, few shadows, a day of diffused edges and quiet corners\u2014though if the cover loosens later, the UV will climb quickly despite the softness of the sky.\n\nExpect a largely overcast day that reads more contemplative than grim, pleasant enough for unhurried errands or a steady walk to clear the mind. Dress in light layers: a long-sleeve or a thin jacket you can shrug off if the humidity settles; breathable fabrics will keep you comfortable under the blanket of cloud. This is good weather for small, useful rituals\u2014an early caf\u00e9 stop, a tidy of the desk, a grocery run before the rush, or a stroll to listen to the town wake\u2014letting the gray give everything a quiet gloss.",
