    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a broken quilt of cloud, the kind that lets a few brave stars cut through. The forecast keeps it simple: scattered clouds through late evening into the small hours, no blazing sun to speak of now and a UV index essentially asleep. The air should feel clear enough between the drifting patches, with a gentle, muted glow where the moon finds its windows. It\u2019s a quiet, uncomplicated night, not threatening, not showy, just calm.\n\nDress for an easy after-dinner wander: a light jacket or soft knit over comfortable layers, something you can push up at the sleeves when the breeze stills. This is a good hour to walk the block, unhurried, or to sit on the veranda with a cup of tea and a book you don\u2019t mind drifting in and out of. Windows can be cracked for fresh air while you tidy the kitchen, water the herbs, or finally write that short note you\u2019ve been meaning to send. Let the night breathe, and keep plans simple; the sky, with its scattered veils, is doing the same.",
