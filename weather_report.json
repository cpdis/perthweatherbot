The forecast hints at a slight chance of rain tapering off shortly, leaving behind a partly cloudy sky that cradles the promise of clearer moments. The air whispers of a low around 48, with a west-northwest wind picking up, creating a brisk ambiance that turns the evening into something crisp and invigorating. The chance for rain lingers like a fleeting thought, but now, the city seems to hold its breath, awaiting tomorrow's sun.\n\nFriday dawns with a different disposition. The clouds are expected to part, revealing a sunny disposition that may coax the temperature to a mild 59, slipping subtly into cooler levels as the afternoon stretches on. For those venturing out, layers will be the key\u2014think a cozy sweater beneath a light jacket, perfect for embracing the brisk winds, yet allowing for comfort as the sun breaks through. Ample opportunities await to enjoy the day\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the waters glimmer beneath the sun, or visiting an outdoor caf\u00e9 where warm drinks can stave off the cool sea air. As the day unfolds, embrace the beauty of this urban landscape, where the skyline is momentarily washed free of fog, revealing San Francisco in its vivid splendor.",
