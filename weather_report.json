    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cloak of partial cloudiness drapes the city, offering a serene contrast to the vibrant urban lights below. With a chill in the air that beckons for warmth, temperatures dip around 45 degrees, whispering a reminder that winter lingers still. The breeze, soft and unhurried from the west southwest, carries with it a hint of moisture, suggesting the haunting presence of fog not far away, though the city itself remains mostly clear at this hour.\n\nTomorrow promises a modest improvement in visibility, with the sun making an appearance, albeit shyly. Highs will hover near 54 before gracefully retreating to an afternoon coolness of about 51. The gentle winds will continue, teasing the contents of your layers, encouraging an outfit that merges comfort with practicality\u2014perhaps a lightweight sweater paired with a jacket. With the promise of partial sunshine, a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a quiet pause at one of the city's charming cafes becomes an inviting prospect. This is a day created for mild adventures where one can savor the subtle beauty of the city, its colors muted but not lost beneath the waning light.",
