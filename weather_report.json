    "weather_report": "Perth eases into late afternoon with the light turning pewter and the breeze smelling faintly of wet pavement to come. The sun is muted and shy behind thickening cloud, its bite already spent; UV is low now, and the day\u2019s edges look softened as showers gather toward evening. Expect a gentle, on\u2011again off\u2011again rain to arrive around the commute and linger into night, more a hush than a squall, the kind that darkens the roads and sets the birds to early roosting. It feels mild but cooling, a quietly damp kind of pleasant.\n\nA light waterproof and easy layers will suit you, with shoes you don\u2019t mind meeting puddles and perhaps a small umbrella for company. If you\u2019ve a quick errand, take it now before the first drops; otherwise slip home unhurried, put a pot on, and let the windows tick with drizzle while you sort tomorrow\u2019s bag or finish a chapter you\u2019ve been neglecting. If you need a stretch, steal a short loop close to home between showers, then reward yourself with something warm and simple.",
