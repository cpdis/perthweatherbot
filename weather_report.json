    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a quilt of broken cloud just past midnight, the sky smudged and shy of starlight. Toward dawn the cover thickens to a full gray lid, so first light will be muted, more silver than gold. Expect a soft-focus morning with modest clarity; any sun will arrive filtered and reluctant. UV is negligible now, but after sunrise\u2014spring being what it is here\u2014it will rise quickly even through cloud, so treat midday with respect if you\u2019re lingering outdoors.\n\nDress in light layers: a long-sleeve or thin jacket for the small hours, something breathable beneath for later. It\u2019s a pleasant, understated kind of day\u2014neither dazzling nor dour\u2014made for quiet errands and gentle starts. Put the kettle on, clear a few emails, take a slow loop of the block before breakfast. After sunrise, a library drop-off, a neat supermarket run, or reorganizing a corner of the shed will suit the dimmer light. If the ceiling loosens, claim a caf\u00e9 table under an awning and let the day idle by.",
