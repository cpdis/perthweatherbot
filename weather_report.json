    "weather_report": "Goode Beach drifts into late afternoon under a seamless lid of cloud, the light softened to pewter and the horizon a gentle blur. Sunshine looks unlikely to stage an appearance; the UV is low now and will stay that way as evening folds in, with the sky remaining overcast into nightfall. It\u2019s a quiet, muted sort of clarity\u2014the kind that makes colors hushed and the water look like brushed steel\u2014pleasant in a contemplative way rather than a dazzling one.\n\nDress in light layers with a windproof outer, something you can zip up for the chill that comes as the day exhales. Think unhurried plans: a shoreline amble to listen to the tide\u2019s low conversation, a thermos and a book on a sheltered bench, a few photographs of moody skies, or a gentle jog before the early dusk. If you\u2019ve chores to run in town, this is the weather that gets them done without hurry or glare, then rewards you with a quiet cup and the sound of the sea.",
