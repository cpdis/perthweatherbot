    "weather_report": "Early evening in Bend arrives under a flawless, glass-clear sky; the sun has slipped below the ridge and left a cool, cobalt afterglow. With daylight fading fast, don\u2019t expect much more sunshine tonight and the UV index has fallen to nearly nothing. The air feels clean and crisp, the horizon sharp as cut paper, and the first stars will come on like pins of light.\n\nThe rest of the evening looks serene and dry, the clarity unbroken. It\u2019s pleasant in that simple winter way if you\u2019re dressed for it: a warm jacket, long sleeves, and something for your ears if you linger. A short stroll to watch the sky deepen, a quiet errand on foot, or a few minutes on the porch taking in Orion would suit the hour. If you\u2019re staying in, open a curtain and let the clear night frame whatever you\u2019re doing; it\u2019s the kind of weather that invites unhurried plans and an easy pace.",
