    "weather_report": "As the night deepens toward early morning in Subiaco, the sky wears a cloak of broken clouds, lending an air of mystery to the sleeping city. There's a serene quality to the atmosphere, even with the clouds mingling at various altitudes, suggesting a day in a state of flux. Today will be one of gentle light and shadow play rather than a vivid pageantry of sunshine. The sun may not assert its presence fully; yet, there's a modest warmth in the sky's embrace. It's a day for subtle elegance, for layering comfortably, where soft textiles mirror the patterns above: a light sweater perhaps, or a graceful scarf to ward off the chill of morning breeze.\n\nA stroll through the quaint lanes as dawn approaches could awaken the senses, or perhaps an amiable book in a cozy nook by the window, where you can watch nature's shifting tapestry overhead. Sip your coffee slowly, let its warmth spread, just as the day's activities should unfold at a leisurely pace, unhurried and contemplative. It's a day made for thoughtful pauses and gentle catches of breath, for savoring the subtle joys of the everyday.",
