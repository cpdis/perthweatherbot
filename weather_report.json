    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Bend, the sky reads like clean slate: quiet, cold, and star-pricked. Expect the morning to open clear with bright, uncomplicated sunshine, then gather a few polite, wandering clouds by late morning. It should feel crisp and high-desert bright, the kind of light that sharpens edges and makes distant ridgelines pop. UV stays low early and only nudges to modest levels by late morning, enough to warrant sunglasses if you\u2019re out. The day looks largely calm and dry, with good clarity and that winter hush that invites you to breathe a little deeper.\n\nDress in confident layers: a warm coat over a sweater, hat and gloves for the early hours, and sunglasses in a pocket for when the sun takes charge. A short walk to watch the town wake, a coffee on a bench where the light spills across the sidewalk, or a few errands while the streets are quiet would suit the mood. By mid-morning, a gentle spin to the market or a loop around a nearby park feels right\u2014nothing heroic, just small, steady pleasures in a bright, cool day.",
