    "weather_report": "As darkness descends over Downtown San Francisco, the evening unfolds under a canopy of mostly cloudy skies, whispering hints of cooler temperatures ahead. A gentle south-southwest breeze lingers softly, barely stirring the air, while the world below glimmers with a mosaic of city lights. With temperatures settling to around 49 degrees, one might consider slipping into a light sweater or a cozy jacket \u2014 perfect for meandering through the streets or finding solace in a quiet caf\u00e9.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, the dawn promises a slight chance of drizzle, but more likely it will usher in a mostly sunny canvas painted with hues of blue, gradually warming to a high close to 60 degrees. As the day matures, the afternoon air may hint at a brisk chill, nudging temperatures downward to around 56 degrees. Fog may still weave through the outskirts, particularly along the coast, softening the outlines of land against the water, but the clearer skies will invite you outside. A walk along the Embarcadero or a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park could serve as perfect companions to a crisp, refreshing day, allowing you to embrace the unique charm of San Francisco's autumn reflections.",
