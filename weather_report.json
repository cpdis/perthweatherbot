    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air bears a crisp chill reminiscent of ocean breezes that meander through the streets, while the golden glow from streetlights dances across the damp pavement. Low clouds have begun to blanket the city, hinting at the partial cloud cover predicted for the night ahead, with a low around 46 degrees whispering reminders of the season's cool embrace. The winds are gentle, barely stirring the air around us, allowing the familiar contours of the hills and the distant shimmer of the Golden Gate Bridge to blur softly into the twilight.\n\nTomorrow promises a gradual shift, with partly sunny skies emerging to greet a high near 55. Yet, as the day unfolds, expect the temperature to dip slightly in the afternoon, transforming the warmth of midday into a gentle, cooling touch. Dressing in layers will serve you well; a light jacket will be your companion against the chill of the morning and evening, as the brisk breezes whisper of their maritime origins. Amidst this inviting climate, there lies an opportunity to wander the city \u2014 perhaps taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or sipping a warm coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9, delighting in the ever-changing canvas of San Francisco's skyline as it subtly reveals and conceals itself beneath the low-hanging clouds.",
