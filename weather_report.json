    "weather_report": "The streets of Downtown San Francisco are cloaked in a soothing gray, the warmth of the day yielding to an unyielding rain that whispers on rooftops and streets. Patches of thick cloud hover ominously, hinting at the downpour that awaits. As evening approaches, the wind picks up, rustling the city in a vibrant yet restless dance, with gusts that sing at 51 mph, echoing the energy of a city that never really sleeps. The forecast promises an unrelenting cascade of rain, with the heavens opening wide, heralding a night punctuated by heavy downpours and perhaps the rumble of distant thunder.\n\nIn such weather, one might favor layers\u2014a sturdy waterproof jacket, perhaps a scarf to fend off the brisk touch of the southeast winds, and shoes resilient enough to navigate the slick streets. It\u2019s a fine evening for indulging in the comforting embrace of a cozy caf\u00e9, a warm drink in hand while the world outside swirls in a symphony of droplets. Alternatively, the thrill of a bookstore or an art gallery beckons, offering a retreat from the storm\u2014a chance to soak in beauty while the weather tells its own story just beyond the glass.",
