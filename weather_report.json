As the clock ticks past two in the morning, a whisper of warmth sneaks in, promising the mercury to edge towards a comfortable 57 degrees. The west-southwest wind, blustering at times, dances through the air with gusts that can nearly take your breath away, adding an element of spirited chaos to the otherwise tranquil night. \n\nAs dawn breaks, the rain may relent for a fleeting moment, allowing the city to breathe under layers of mottled clouds. The day promises to remain mostly gray, with skies hinting at occasional peeks of sun, though the moods might continue to shift with the whims of that persistent, swirling marine layer.
