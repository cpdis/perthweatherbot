    "weather_report": "As the sun casts a soft glow over Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon carries a hint of warmth, tempered by the briskness of a west-southwest breeze. The city stands mostly sunny, its splendor momentarily unmarred by the encroaching clouds that hint at the rain likely to come later. As dusk approaches, clouds drift lazily across the horizon, framing the iconic Golden Gate Bridge with a hint of mystery. By early evening, you'll feel the shift as rain begins to fall, transforming the vibrant streets into a wet sheen, adding a reflective beauty to every corner.\n\nTonight promises a heavier embrace of cloud cover as temperatures hover around the low fiftys, possibly nudging slightly higher as warmer air makes its way in. The chance of rain gauges at a strong ninety percent, inviting the wisdom of sturdy footwear and perhaps a light jacket, or even an umbrella if you're venturing out into the night. For those seeking a peaceful reprieve from the daily bustle, an evening stroll beneath the raindrops can be serene, while the cozy ambiance of a caf\u00e9 or bistro may provide the perfect refuge. As the city prepares for a drenching, remember that the charm of San Francisco often blooms in the aftermath of rain, leaving trails of new conversations and fresh perspectives coursing through its streets.",
