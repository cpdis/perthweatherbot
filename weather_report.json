    "weather_report": "As the early hours of Wednesday unfold in Downtown San Francisco, a veil of patchy fog mingles with the crispness of a winter night, cloaking the city in an ethereal shroud. The air carries a briskness that whispers of the changing seasons, with temperatures dipping delicately to around 47 degrees. Those stirring from their slumber might encounter a fleeting fog until morning breaks fully, giving way to the promise of partly sunny skies that brighten the horizon. As the sun rises, the city will see areas of fog dissipate before 10 a.m., leaving in its wake a high that hovers near 58 degrees. \n\nIt\u2019s a serene morning perfect for a contemplative stroll through the quiet streets or perhaps a leisurely coffee break in one of the cozy cafes nestled among the iconic buildings. As the day wears on, temperatures will begin to drop gently, casting a subtle chill into the afternoon air, prompting a light jacket or a warm sweater for comfort. The north wind, gentle yet persistent at about 7 miles per hour, adds a refreshing note to the midday atmosphere. Given the shifting visibility and the charm of a fog-kissed San Francisco, today\u2019s adventures might best lie in the quieter corners of the city\u2014discovering an art gallery or perusing the shelves of a local bookstore, where the rich history of the city whispers from every page.",
