    "weather_report": "Perth drifts through a clear, quiet midnight, the kind of sky that makes the city feel weightless; stars hold their places and the air has that gentle, dry clarity that invites deeper breaths. The hours toward dawn look just as clean, with a crisp horizon likely to bloom into a bright, uncomplicated morning. Expect the light to sharpen quickly after sunrise; with skies this clear, the UV will rise fast and grow assertive by late morning, even in spring\u2019s polite warmth.\n\nIt should be a pleasant day if you dress by the clock: a light layer for the early chill, then something breezy, a hat, sunglasses, and reliable sunscreen for the midday glare. Windows open for a brief airing, a quiet walk to watch the city wake, coffee on a balcony if you have one; later, errands on foot or a small bout of gardening before the sun gets bossy. The day promises high visibility and a steady mood, better suited to simple tasks done without hurry than to anything grand.",
