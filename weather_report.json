    "weather_report": "As the clock softly ticks past midnight, Subiaco finds itself cradled under a damp embrace, with gentle droplets painting a delicate glaze over the tapestry of the night. This gentle rainfall is predicted to linger through the night, weaving into the early hours with its soft whispers upon rooftops and puddles forming in alleys. While the clouds hang low, and the prospects for the sun's radiant debut appear dimmed, the atmosphere shimmers with a moist freshness that speaks of quietude and renewal. With the opaque sky acting as a gentle filter, the day's colors may become pale and subdued, and the UV index will likely remain inconspicuous, inviting only a faint shadow of the sun's warmth.\n\nIn such tranquil conditions, one may wrap themselves in the cozy comfort of a light waterproof jacket or a favorite umbrella as a companion. The understated beauty of a gentle drizzle suggests a contemplative mood perfect for pursuits of the mind or soul \u2013 perhaps a novel eagerly awaiting its pages to be turned, or a quiet cup of tea serenading one with its steaming calm. For those drawn outside, walking under the canopy of raindrops while the world softly sleeps can offer a symphony of solitude and reflection. As the town breathes with the rhythm of rain, there's a cinematic grace to the morning, where the ordinary is transformed into something touchingly enchanting.",
