    "weather_report": "As the velvety curtain of night slowly ascends over Subiaco, the forecast promises a celestial spectacle of minimal clouds. This clarity should lend itself to a beautiful display of constellations, so star gazers ought to seize the opportunity. The atmosphere carries promises of another peaceful day, with the suggestion of a gentle breeze gracing the blankets of the few clouds in the sky. As we slip into the solitude of the early morning, don't expect the sun to peek over still for some hours, but rest assured when it does, it promises to share its pleasant, non-overbearing warmth. \n\nFor today, I'd advise residents to embrace the subtle kissing of the sun with a light cardigan, enough to take the edge off the morning chill. Sunglasses would be a valuable daytime companion, but hold back on the sunscreen for it seems a hat will be protection enough. It will be a morning perfect for a leisurely walk in the park, and later, perhaps enjoy the company of an engrossing book in one of Subiako's many charming bistros. Just imagine ending the day watching another serene sunset, rocking on a porch swing, drinking in the euphonious sounds of the night as it tucks in another picturesque day.",
