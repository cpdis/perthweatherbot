    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the weather adopts a somber hue, draped in a thick, cloudy blanket which suggests an impending downpour. Rain is confirmed, with temperatures hovering around a cool 57 degrees, descending to about 54 as the afternoon lingers. The relentless south wind sways gently at around 10 mph, though its presence feels muted against the weight of the sky. The air is heavy with moisture, and with a 100% chance of precipitation looming, one can't help but feel that this weather calls for shelter over exploration. \n\nAs evening approaches, the rain may relent somewhat, offering a slender chance of clearing before dawn, with a low of about 49 degrees. The evening will remain mostly overcast, an ideal backdrop for cozy indoor pursuits or quiet, contemplative strolls beneath umbrellas that shuffle in the rhythm of falling droplets. Those venturing out would do well to don warm layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy jacket accompanied by a soft scarf\u2014while seeking the warmth of inviting cafes or the snug embrace of a well-stocked bookstore. In such weather, a quiet afternoon spent enjoying a hot drink while listening to the soft patter of rain against windows feels like the perfect antidote to the chill.",
