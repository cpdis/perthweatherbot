    "weather_report": "Night has settled softly over Subiaco. The sky is scrubbed clear and still, a quiet, starry dome; the air reads clean and a touch cool. Forecasts keep it cloudless through late evening and into the small hours, so clarity stays high and streetlights feel sharper at the edges. The sun is long gone, so UV is essentially absent; if this clear spell greets the morning as well, expect a bright, uncomplicated start and a brisk climb in UV once the sun gets some angle.\n\nComfort tonight calls for a light jacket or sweater, and perhaps an extra layer if you linger. It\u2019s a good evening for small, ordinary pleasures: a slow lap around the block, watering the herbs, a few pages on the veranda, or sorting tomorrow\u2019s list by an open window. If you\u2019ll be out early, tuck a brimmed hat and sunscreen into the bag. For now, Subiaco feels unhurried and precise, the kind of clear night that makes you walk a little slower on the way home.",
