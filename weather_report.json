The high of around 62 degrees offers a comfortable embrace, perfect for a light sweater or a casual jacket. The streets are bathed in golden light, yet there is a whisper of a breeze from the west, as if the city itself is taking a breath before the evening turns, letting you feel the transition in the air.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the clouds to gather like old friends reuniting, heralding the chance of drizzle tonight. With a low dipping to about 54 degrees, gentle layers are advisable\u2014perhaps a cozy scarf or a medium-weight coat that allows for movement. The prospect of rain looms with a moderate chance, enticing evening walks under umbrellas or cozy gatherings in your favorite caf\u00e9. Given the clarity of earlier hours, it presents a splendid opportunity for a quiet stroll, admiring the contours of the city and the reflections on the bay before the deluge. Tonight, the dampness will soften the sharp edges of the city, creating a serene backdrop for whatever quiet pursuits you choose to embrace.",
