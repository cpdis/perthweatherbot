    "weather_report": "As the clock silently ushers in the early hours of the morning, fog envelops the San Francisco skyline, slowly unfurling with the whispers of impending rain. Tonight, the air carries a chill, a reminder of the season's approach, with clouds hanging low, casting a grey hue over the city. Drizzle is likely to kiss the ground between the witching hours, setting the stage for a day tinged with dampness. Tomorrow promises a steadfast rain, saturating the landscape with its persistent cadence, while the temperature hovers in the brisk realm of the low sixties. \n\nIn this atmospheric embrace, one might find solace indoors, either curled up with a good book, savoring the delicate aroma of freshly brewed coffee, or perhaps indulging in the simple pleasure of watching movies, while outside, the rain serenades the earth. Dress warmly, layering against the chill, bringing a cozy scarf along to fend off the biting wind that could nudge through even the coziest of sweaters. Finding refuge in a local caf\u00e9 or the charm of a favorite bookstore could make for a perfectly enjoyable day, tucked away from the dreary skies where stories unfold just as beautifully as the weather transforms.",
