    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the weather maintains a cool demeanor, echoing the city\u2019s maritime heritage. The afternoon unfolds with a partial embrace of sunlight, teasing the contours of buildings and casting long shadows across the streets. A brisk west wind stirs with a gentle force, reminding passersby of the coolness that frequently graces this urban enclave. The high sagely hovers around 57 degrees, retreating slightly as the day wanes and the chilling air edges in, drawing temperatures down to the low 40s for the night.\n\nThose wandering the city\u2019s vibrant lanes might encounter more than just a breath of fresh air; they may notice a soft murkiness settling along the horizons, hinting at a veil of fog seeking refuge in the nooks and crannies of the architecture. This marine layer, though not overwhelming, suggests a quiet evening ahead with partly cloudy skies cradling an unpredictable chill. For attire, light layers would suffice\u2014perhaps a comfortable sweater or jacket that can be easily removed should the sun briefly reclaim dominion. As the day huddles into evening, thoughtful residents might opt for an invigorating walk along the Embarcadero, pausing to sip a warm drink while observing the shimmering water, their reflections mingling with the gentle chaos of the city, perfectly poised between its historical allure and modern clamor.",
