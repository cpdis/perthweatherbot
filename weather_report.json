    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the sky is a canvas painted with clarity, a sharp contrast to the customary fog that often wraps the city in its embrace. Tonight promises mostly clear skies, inviting the moon to cast its gentle glow on the streets below. The cool night air carries a hint of the ocean, with temperatures lingering comfortably around fifty-two. An occasional gust of wind rustles through the trees, reminding all who wander outside of the vibrant life that stirs within the city.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, sunlight is expected to take center stage once more, ushering in a day marked by warmth and brightness. With a high around sixty-six, the afternoon will gently transition many hearts toward a cooler embrace of sixty-three degrees. The west-northwest wind, gentle yet refreshing, will accompany pedestrian explorations of the city, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or savoring a cup of coffee at a quiet cafe. For attire, a light sweater or jacket is advisable as the temperatures dip slightly towards evening, making it a fine day for discovering hidden gems of local artistry or perusing bookshops in the Mission District, where the air will remain crisp and the atmosphere engaging.",
