    "weather_report": "As the afternoon settles over Subiaco, the sky stretches out like a perfect canvas. The earlier few clouds have dispersed, leaving behind a clear sky that promises to bathe the landscape in gentle sunshine for the rest of the day. With the temperature likely to be pleasantly warm, it\u2019s an ideal setting for a leisurely stroll through the town's historic streets or a relaxed afternoon in one of the area's charming parks. The sunlight is abundant enough that one might want to consider a hat and sunglasses to shield against the afternoon glow, yet mild enough to feel warm and welcoming against the skin. Though the UV index might be lingering at moderate levels, it's wise to carry some sunscreen for prolonged outdoor jaunts. Today whispers of unhurried adventures and simple pleasures, inviting moments of quiet enjoyment with a good book on a sunlit bench or a serene siesta in the garden, perhaps accompanied by the soft rustle of leaves in the summer breeze. The day invites you to embrace its clarity and warmth, allowing both body and spirit to unwind gracefully in its gentle embrace as the afternoon unfolds.",
