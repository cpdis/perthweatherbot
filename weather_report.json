    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds with a delicate interplay of sun and clouds, offering a rather tranquil yet cool atmosphere. While the high hovers around a modest 56 degrees, one can sense a chill in the air as afternoon descends and the temperature gently decreases, bringing a hint of briskness. The wind, a soft north-northeast whisper, caresses the streets, adding to the day's quietly reflective charm. With clouds gathering in anticipation of rain, the sky wears a grayish hue, suggesting that the sun may soon be obscured, paving the way for a potential drizzle after 4 PM.\n\nAs for the visibility, it feels fresh but slightly hazy, with the marine layer hunched over the bay, lending a soft focus to the iconic bridge and the city skyline. Dressing for such a day requires a thoughtful layering; perhaps a light sweater over a long-sleeved shirt, coupled with comfortable shoes for a leisurely stroll. Later, as the evening approaches, be prepared for the possibility of rain, so an umbrella or a light rain jacket might be prudent. In this serene yet shifting weather, a walk through the local parks or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 could provide a delightful way to savor the day, perhaps even finding solace in the quiet drama of the clouds above.",
