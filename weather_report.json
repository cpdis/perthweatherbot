    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this December morning, Downtown San Francisco awakens beneath a canopy of gentle clarity, the city\u2019s contours emerging sharply against the cool air. The forecast hints at a day bathed in sunshine, with temperatures gradually lifting to a comfortable 63 degrees by midday, then softly descending to the upper 50s as the afternoon wanes. The brisk north wind carries the whisper of the Golden Gate and the distant Pacific, although no fog blankets the horizon, leaving a crisp blue expanse above.\n\nAs the sun ascends, it will illuminate the streets, inviting urban explorers to wander through neighborhoods rich in character. It's a perfect day for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, indulging in the flavors of a cozy caf\u00e9, or perhaps visiting a local art gallery. Dressing in layers is prudent; a light sweater or jacket will provide warmth against the morning chill while remaining comfortable enough as the sun bathes the city in its gentle embrace later on. Embrace the tranquility of a Sunday in the city\u2014perhaps with a book in hand at a well-loved park or a quiet moment in a favorite nook, enjoying all that the dawn brings.",
