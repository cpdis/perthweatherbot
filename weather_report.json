    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a crisp clarity pervades the air, underlining a promising day ahead. With temperatures slipping to a cool 47 degrees overnight, the morning feels refreshing and invigorating, as a gentle breeze whispers through the streets. Anticipation hangs in the atmosphere, hinting at a sunny disposition as the sun ascends, soon to bathe the city in a warm glow, reaching highs near 62. Visibility stretches far, offering stunning vistas that invite exploration, though the cool late afternoon weather will encourage you to bundle up a little before heading out.\n\nDressed suitably for the climate with layers to embrace both warmth and comfort, a light jacket will serve you well\u2014perhaps one that shields against the brisk wind. The absence of fog signifies a rare clarity, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the city's charming parks. A pleasant cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 could cradle your hands as you soak in the views, or if adventure calls, consider popping into a nearby gallery; the city\u2019s artistic pulse is just a short walk away. Today holds the promise of quiet delight, a canvas waiting to be filled with the simple pleasures of life in San Francisco.",
