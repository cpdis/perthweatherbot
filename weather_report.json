The sky, draped in a heavy cloak of clouds, lends a subdued cast to the cityscape, where the distant silhouettes of the Golden Gate and the urban horizon dissolve into a wash of grey.

With the temperatures slightly rising through the night to about 55 degrees, an umbrella and weatherproof layers will be essential for venture beyond the doorstep. The damp atmosphere may invoke a cozy retreat indoors, where one might engage in savoring a warm cup of tea while enjoying the sound of rain against the windows, or perhaps seeking out a hidden gem of a caf\u00e9 to linger in next to fellow patrons escaping the chill. For those brave enough to brave the elements, a leisurely stroll through the neighborhood, with the promise of catching a glint of raindrops on the pavement, could offer a refreshing perspective of the city's quiet resilience against the weather's whims.",
