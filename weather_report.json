    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a patchwork sky, the sun slipping in and out of broken cloud like a shy performer behind the curtain. Through late morning into early afternoon those clouds will linger, letting through generous, dappled light without the furnace glare; the air should feel clean and open, colors a touch muted, edges of buildings and jacaranda branches nicely defined. Even with the softened sunshine, midday UV in late summer can bite, so expect a day that looks gentle but still asks for respect.\n\nIt feels like a pleasant, workable day: warm enough for comfort, tempered by cloud, better for ambling than basking. Choose breathable layers, a hat and sunglasses, with a quiet film of sunscreen on the skin. This is a good morning for errands on foot, a slow coffee in a shaded courtyard, or a visit to the library where the light at the windows turns pages a paler gold. If you\u2019ve time, thread a short walk through nearby streets or a garden before the noon brightness hardens, then keep the afternoon light\u2014laundry on the line, a careful prune of the herbs, or a gentle loop to the shops while the sky continues its on-and-off conversation with the sun.",
