    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under an unblemished sky this afternoon, the light clean and glassy, shadows sharpening as the day leans toward evening. Sunshine is full-throated and unapologetic; earlier it had that fierce, springtime bite, and even now it asks for respect. Expect it to stay clear straight through twilight, the air steady and visibility crisp, with a gentle easing of heat and a softening glow as the sun drifts lower.\n\nDress for light and ease: breathable layers, sunglasses, a hat if you\u2019ll be out a while, and a dab of sunscreen for late-day errands. As it cools, a thin outer layer will be enough. It\u2019s pleasant weather for ordinary pleasures: a slow wander to pick up a few groceries, a quiet loop on the bike before dinner, watering the garden while the light goes honey-gold, or reading on a porch where the breeze can find you. Clear skies promise a simple, satisfying evening.",
