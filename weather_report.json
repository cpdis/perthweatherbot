    "weather_report": "West Busselton slips into late afternoon with a clean, glassy sky and sun that still feels confident on the skin. The air is bright and salt-sweet, the horizon sharp, with only the faintest suggestion of evening cloud to come. UV remains lively for a while yet, easing as the sun tilts toward the bay, so it\u2019s a good hour to seek dappled shade between spells in the open. Expect the evening to stay mostly clear, a gentle sea breeze smoothing the heat and leaving the light honeyed and forgiving before dusk.\n\nDress light and breathable, add sunglasses and a brim, and keep a whisper of sunscreen for the next hour or two; slip a soft layer over the shoulders if you linger after sunset. It\u2019s perfect for finishing the garden watering, hanging the last load of washing to catch the breeze, or a quiet pedal to the shops and back. A slow stroll along the foreshore, an iced coffee on a bench, or reading on the veranda while the day exhales would suit the mood.",
