    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into a clear, untroubled night: the sky polished to a dark sheen, stars with a crisp edge, the air reading as steady and uncomplicated. The sun is long gone, so UV is essentially nil; the world feels glassy and quiet rather than harsh. It\u2019s pleasant in that understated way summer nights can be, with visibility clean and the mood unhurried.\n\nThe forecast holds the sky clear through late evening and into the small hours, so expect continuity rather than surprise. Dress lightly, with a spare layer at hand if you tend to chill when you\u2019re still. This is good weather for the small rituals: a slow loop around the block to unkink the day, watering the herbs before bed, sorting tomorrow\u2019s bag on the veranda, or a short ride to return that thing you meant to drop off. If you\u2019re awake toward midnight, step outside for a minute\u2014the night has that honest, uncomplicated clarity that makes even a quiet street feel well drawn.",
