    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is tranquil, cradled by wisps of sunlight filtered through a gentle haze. The high climbs to a modest warmth, while cooler breezes drift from the west, adding a refreshing bite to the day. As the early afternoon progresses, temperatures will ease into a comfortable cool, cloaked in layered clouds that hint at the presence of fog\u2014particularly near the Golden Gate, where the marine layer seems to linger just beyond the city\u2019s embrace.\n\nTonight, the sky will settle into a partly cloudy cover, allowing for a moment of reflection beneath the stars, with temperatures dipping to a crisp 44 degrees. As you contemplate your attire for this day of subtle contrasts, consider a light jacket layered over a long-sleeve shirt, perfect for navigating the interplay of warmth and chill that characterizes this unique cityscape. With such splendid weather, an afternoon stroll through the quieter corners of the Mission or a cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 could prove enchanting. Embrace the afternoon and evening, each moment a reminder of the beauty woven into San Francisco's ever-changing sky.",
