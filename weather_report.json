    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, as the clock ticks toward the quiet hours, the sky will reveal a tapestry of deep blues punctuated by the flickers of distant city lights. The air, cool and crisp, will settle at a low around forty-six degrees, accompanied by a gentle northwest breeze that could tease out the collar of your jacket. Expect clarity tonight, perhaps a slight chill in the air, but no fog to obscure the view or dampen spirits. \n\nAs we awaken to Christmas Day, a gentle sun will rise, weaving light through the crisp morning air that gradually warms to a high of around fifty-five degrees. Although the day will start bright, expect temperatures to dip toward afternoon, cloaking the afternoon in a soft embrace of coolness. Dress in layers, with a warm knit and perhaps a light scarf, perfect for a stroll through the city\u2019s inviting streets. Consider indulging in a warm beverage at a cozy caf\u00e9, or taking a leisurely walk along the waterfront to soak in the beauty of the bay, where the sun will dance on the water\u2019s surface, a gift in itself on this festive day.",
