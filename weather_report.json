    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a rinsed-blue midday sky, the morning\u2019s pure clarity now softened by a few easygoing clouds. The sun feels forthright and unwavering, lending sharp edges to buildings and a pale shimmer to the streets. Visibility is excellent, the air dry and clean, and with November leaning toward summer the UV will be fierce through the afternoon; it\u2019s the kind of day that looks friendly at a glance but insists on respect.\n\nExpect the sunshine to dominate with only brief veils of cloud. It is pleasant in the shade and a touch abrasive in full glare, so dress light and breathable, add sunglasses and a brimmed hat, and don sunscreen like second nature; keep water close at hand. A quiet lunch in a shaded courtyard suits the moment, or a short, leafy walk by the river before the sun\u2019s bite grows impatient. Hang a load of washing and let the day do the work, tend a few herbs on the balcony, or slip to the library for an hour\u2019s cool calm before running small errands. The day invites simple, unrushed tasks, done thoughtfully between sun and shadow.",
