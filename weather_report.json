The air, still and contemplative, offers a slight rustle through the streets, as a soft southeast wind whispers through the city's iconic skyline. As the sun begins its ascent, the morning holds a subtle promise of clarity, albeit with a brief flirtation with drizzles that may tease the early risers during the dawn\u2019s first light.\n\nAs day unfolds into the afternoon, expect a transformation \u2014 the clouds will part to reveal patches of brilliant sun, illuminating the city\u2019s charm as temperatures peep above the horizon towards a pleasant 60 degrees, dipping again to a cooler 56 by late afternoon. While today will be predominantly sunny, there may be residual wisps of fog lingering by the bay, a reminder of the marine layer that often shrouds the Golden Gate in mystery. For those venturing outside, a light jacket layered over a comfortable shirt is advisable, blending practicality with an air of effortless style. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink would be ideal to savor the day. The weather, with its temperate mix of sun and a hint of coolness, beckons both adventurers and casual wanderers to embrace the simple pleasures of the day ahead.",
