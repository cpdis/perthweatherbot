    "weather_report": "As the clock gently ticks into the early hours of August, Subiaco nestles under a velvet cloak of darkness, spangled with stars, serenely untouched by even the faintest wisp of cloud. The night's stillness wraps around you like a silk scarf, whispering promises of the pristine day to come. The dawn will break with a clear sky, the canopy above as azure as a Roman fresco, warming invitingly as the sun arches across its path. There is no threat in this day's air, no hint that you will need anything more than protection from a gaze so bright, so vivid, that it rivals the vibrancy of Van Gogh's palette. A good pair of sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen ought to guard you from the sun's spirited embrace, allowing you to savor the simple pleasures. The streets of Subiaco call for a leisurely stroll, the early morning hours ideal for wandering among the shadowy vaults of trees lining your path, or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a soulful cup of espresso. As the sun reaches its zenith, you might find solace in the shade of a cherished corner of a well-worn bookshop, or near the gentle lapping waters of a nearby garden fountain. Today's perfect clarity beckons you to explore and relish each whisper of a breeze that dances through your day, as gentle and inviting as a familiar tune played softly on a violin.",
