    "weather_report": "Perth is easing into a clear, golden late afternoon, the sky rinsed of cloud and the light turning honeyed at the edges. Sunshine remains bright but softening; the UV is ebbing now after a sharper bite earlier, so a hat and sunglasses still make sense if you\u2019re out before dusk. The air feels clean and open, a day of simple clarity that invites unhurried steps and small errands finished on foot.\n\nExpect the evening to stay cloudless and calm, pleasant rather than balmy. Short sleeves are fine for now; bring a light layer for after sunset. It\u2019s a good time for a gentle riverside stroll, watering the garden while the heat slips away, or a relaxed supper outdoors with a book nearby. If you\u2019ve been indoors, catch the last of the light from a balcony or front step and let the day run to embers without hurry.",
