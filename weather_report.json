    "weather_report": "As the clock drifts gently past two in the stillness of the night, Subiaco rests under a canopy of stars woven into a clear firmament. With no clouds to interrupt the celestial display, it's a perfect night for those with a hunger for stargazing, or perhaps a quiet moonlit stroll. As dawn approaches, one can almost hear the rustling of daybreak, promising a day kissed by sunshine in its purest form. Anticipate the sun's first rays breaking over the horizon, illuminating the streets, bringing warmth and a soft glow to the day ahead. The clarity of the sky hints at the simplicity and grace of the hours to come, unburdened by the worries of rain or shadow.\n\nToday's weather whispers of perfection\u2014inviting yet without the oppressive intensity of summer. It's the kind of day that gently nudges you to slip into your most comfortable casual attire. A light sweater might suffice until the sun\u2019s gentle persistence encourages you to shed an extra layer, revealing a tee, sleeves rolled, arms bared to soak in the gentle reminder of spring's embrace. Consider a languid morning on your balcony with a cherished book, pages fluttering with the breeze, or a leisurely walk to a local market, the sky an unobtrusive companion. There is a soothing tranquillity to the air, inviting both reflection and leisurely conversation over coffee in a sun-dappled caf\u00e9. The world outside is rendered in soft pastel hues, and it's a scene that whispers for you to pause, savor, and simply be.",
