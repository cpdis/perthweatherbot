    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft embrace of clouds drapes the city, whispering promises of rain to come. A light chill creeps through the urban landscape, suggesting a low around 48 degrees, while a gentle south wind carries the faint scent of moisture. The forecast hints at a high probability of rain tomorrow, nudging the city into a cautious anticipation of a wet Sunday. The night air feels thick with the impending drizzle that may begin as early as 10 PM, hinting at a delicate dance between clouds and city lights. \n\nFor those contemplating an evening stroll, layered clothing is advisable\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a light raincoat to shield against both the cool air and the chance of the first drops falling from the sky. The urban sheen under the streetlights hints at a playful interplay of shadows and reflections, providing a unique backdrop for a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or a moment of introspection at the waterfront. While the fog does not blanket the city just yet, it looms on the horizon, its presence felt but not fully realized, offering a serene yet enchanting nocturnal atmosphere.",
