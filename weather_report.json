    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a hush after midnight, the sky mostly clear with only a few wisps drifting past the stars. The air feels clean and unhurried, and toward the pre-dawn hours those few clouds linger, thin and forgettable. Sunrise should arrive with a gentle, unbroken light and a high, open sky\u2014bright rather than blazing at first. Expect good clarity and a sun-forward day once it gets going; the UV index is negligible now, modest at dawn, and will rise quickly by midmorning.\n\nIt\u2019s a night for a light layer on the shoulders and unhurried thoughts. Come first light, trade the jumper for breathable clothes, a brimmed hat, and sunglasses; sunscreen becomes wise not long after breakfast. Mundane comforts fit the mood: set out your day\u2019s errands, read a few pages, then an early stroll beneath the purple confetti of jacarandas, a quiet coffee run, watering the garden or a short bike spin before the sun turns insistent. Later, favor shade and simple tasks, letting the bright hours pass like a polished coin.",
