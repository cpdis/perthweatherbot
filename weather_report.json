    "weather_report": "Bend wakes under a quilt of overcast, the sky a quiet slab of pewter that mutes the edges of town. Early light will be slow to arrive and filtered when it does, with little in the way of sunshine and a very low UV bite. Expect the morning to stay gray and steady, the view soft around the margins, the kind of clarity that feels calm rather than bright. It\u2019s a gentle, contemplative start, not harsh, not hurried.\n\nDress in comfortable layers and a warm jacket; a beanie and light gloves won\u2019t go amiss against the January chill. With the day leaning subdued, this is fine weather for unhurried errands, a lingering cup at your favorite cafe, a quiet hour at the library, or a short walk along the river to watch the town wake in muted colors. Photographers might enjoy the flat, forgiving light; runners and dog-walkers will find the air agreeable if not sparkling. If you stay in, put on a record and tend to small projects\u2014the kind of morning that rewards patience more than ambition.",
