    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a quiet midnight with a clear, polished sky giving way to a few strays of cloud toward dawn. The air feels clean and settled, the kind that sharpens distant sounds and makes the streetlights glow a little warmer. Expect the early hours to stay mostly open and gentle; by first light the clouds may loiter but not spoil the day, just adding texture to a brightening sky. Sunshine should be crisp at sunrise and more assertive as the morning wears on; UV is negligible overnight and will build after sunup, so plan shade and sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger outside later.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant start: light layers will do, a soft jumper for the cool before dawn, sunglasses and a hat for the hours after breakfast. If you\u2019re awake now, this is good time for a quiet chapter by the window or a slow stretch on the balcony; early risers might take a brisk walk for coffee as the sky lifts, water the garden, or ride in before the traffic begins. Keep plans simple and unhurried, and let the clear air do some thinking for you.",
