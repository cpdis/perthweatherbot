Through the early to late afternoon, light showers are likely to wander through\u2014more a courteous tap on the shoulder than a soaking\u2014so the sun will spend most of the day as a pale rumor behind the grey. UV is tempered by the cloud but still lively around lunchtime; a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray if you\u2019re out for a while. The air sits mild with a damp edge, clarity softened rather than obscured, rooftops and trees rendered in gentle, pewter tones. Dress for changeability: breathable layers with a light waterproof or trench, shoes that won\u2019t fuss over wet pavements, and a compact umbrella. It\u2019s a day for ordinary comforts\u2014finish errands before the first sprinkle, sink into a caf\u00e9 window seat with a slim novel, slip into a matinee, or potter at home with a simmering pot and an open window. Come evening, the streets will shine and the world will feel rinsed and calm.",
