    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into evening under a polished, cloudless vault. The late-day sun was bright but gentle, falling cleanly across terraces and stone; now the light has thinned to a cool blue, and the UV has eased to almost nothing. The air feels tidy and transparent, with edges crisp and sounds carrying a little farther than usual, the kind of clarity that makes street lamps look deliberate and the first stars quietly confident.\n\nThe rest of the night should remain serenely clear and dry, pleasantly cool without a bite. Dress in light layers\u2014a breathable shirt with a cardigan or light jacket for after dark\u2014and comfortable shoes if you\u2019re inclined to wander. It\u2019s a fine time to step out for a slow errand, walk the dog around the block, or coast a short loop on the bike before closing the day. If home is calling, crack a window, tidy the kitchen at an easy pace, and read a few pages while the sky deepens.",
