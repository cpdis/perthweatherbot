    "weather_report": "In Cottesloe, the day unfolds with a lingering drizzle, a subtle whisper of rain that has pattered lightly since morning's earliest hours, casting a soft balm over the bustling coastal suburb. The gentle rain continues its serenade, conjuring images of umbrellas casting circular shadows on rain-glossed pavements and the soothing scent of petrichor rising from the earth. As clouds gather, obscuring direct sunlight, the sun plays a reticent performer, offering only muted glimpses through the veiled sky, rendering the day pleasantly mellow rather than bleak. While the UV index isn't pressing, making sunburn a distant worry, the charm of the day lies in its tranquil greyness, a perfect backdrop for introspection or an intimate, low-key day. Dressing warmly in cozy knits layered under water-resistant attire would be wise, with boots ideally suited for the occasional puddle. \n\nEmbrace the house's welcoming warmth, perhaps savoring a steaming cup of tea or coffee while perched comfortably by a window, listening to the rain's gentle murmur that often accompanies moments of contemplation and creativity. Alternatively, an afternoon stroll beneath a sturdy umbrella, with a wander through the less-trodden paths of your local gardens or streets, could add a romantic air, reminding you of scenes from novels where the weather was not an impediment but an integral part of the narrative. Today's quaint and peaceful drizzle invites one to enjoy the simple things in life, framed perfectly by nature's percussive show.",
