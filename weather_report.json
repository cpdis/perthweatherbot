    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco arrives under a clean, unmarred sky; the light is turning honeyed and the air feels open and uncomplicated. The forecast stays clear through early evening, promising a bright, untroubled sunset and a gentle slide into a starry night. It has been a decidedly sunny day; the UV index would have been very high at midday, now easing toward low as the sun sinks and the color of things warms.\n\nFor the next hour or so, a hat and a touch of sunscreen still make sense; after dusk, a light layer will be enough as the heat loosens its grip. These are good conditions for small errands on foot, a quiet spin to pick up bread, watering the herbs, or letting the day drain away on a balcony with a book. With the sky so clear, a slow loop through the neighborhood or a simple supper near an open window feels right, unrushed and sure of itself.",
