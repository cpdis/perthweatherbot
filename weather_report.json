    "weather_report": "Ocean Beach spends the late afternoon under a brushed canvas of scattered clouds, the sun slipping in and out with a soft, silvery glow. It feels calm and gentle rather than stark; the light is flattering, the horizon clean, with the ocean throwing back little shards of brightness when the sun finds a gap. Earlier, under those broken clouds, the UV likely nudged to the moderate side; at this hour it eases, though a few bright bursts still ask for some care if you linger.\n\nExpect the pattern to hold into early evening: intervals of sun, then a brief dimming as a cloud sails past. Dress for changeability\u2014light layers, a breathable shirt with a thin sweater or wind-cutting shell at the ready, sunglasses optional but welcome. It\u2019s a good time for ordinary pleasures: a slow walk along the waterline, a bike ride to pick up something for dinner, a chapter on a bench, or a small errand done on foot before the shadows lengthen.",
