    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a clean, generous blue this early afternoon, the few morning clouds long since melted to the horizon. The sun feels candid and unwavering, casting sharp-edged shadows and making colors pop; the air reads as clear and untroubled, with little haze to soften the view.\n\nExpect the bright spell to hold through the afternoon with barely a whisper of cloud. UV is already assertive for early spring, running moderate to high through the peak hours, so treat the light with respect: sunscreen, sunglasses, and a brimmed hat are wise companions. It\u2019s a day for light layers\u2014cool in the shade, comfortably warm where the sun finds you. Ordinary pleasures suit it best: take lunch outdoors, let laundry dry on the line, wander a quiet block to run an errand, tend a few plants, or read in a courtyard while the light is kind. As evening approaches, keep a light sweater handy for the first hint of cool.",
