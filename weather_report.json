    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft, persistent drizzle begins to blanket the streets, heralding the arrival of heavier rains that will drench the city through the night. The air is cool, hovering around the low fifties, wrapping residents in a cloak of humidity that hints at the robust rainfall to come. The clouds loom over with a heavy presence, shrouding the iconic skyline, while the southeastern winds, though gentle in their embrace, playfully disrupt the stillness with occasional gusts.\n\nTomorrow promises a continuation of this atmospheric theater, with the rain likely lingering throughout the day. Expect the temperature to remain stable around the upper fifties, slowly reflecting the chill of the advancing front. The visibility may waver, obscured by the thick, gray marine layer that hangs visibly in the air, casting an ethereal haze over familiar vistas. It\u2019s a day best suited for cozy indoor pursuits, perhaps a stroll through a local gallery, immersing oneself in the crafts and creativity that thrive in these moments, followed by sheltering in a caf\u00e9 where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the gentle patter of rain on window panes. Dressing warmly with layers of sweaters and waterproof outerwear will be advisable, ensuring comfort amidst the satisfying rhythm of a city breathing in the rain.",
