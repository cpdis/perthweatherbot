    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Busselton the sky is largely clear, the night airy and unhurried; by the small hours it stays open and starlit before a quilt of broken cloud drifts in near dawn. The air feels clean, visibility crisp, and the world quiet enough to hear the ocean think. Early light will filter through that patchwork, giving the morning a gentle, pearly start.\n\nAs the day opens, expect generous sunshine between passing clouds and a quick climb in brightness; in early summer here the UV will surge after breakfast to very high levels, so plan shade, a wide-brim hat, and sunscreen if you linger outdoors. It\u2019s a pleasant, cool-to-mild start favoring light layers now and breathable fabrics later. Good hours for a slow walk along the foreshore before the sun grows insistent, to water the garden, or to fetch a loaf from town while streets are still yawning. By midday, keep outdoor tasks short and unhurried; save a longer errand for late afternoon shade, or read by a window while the day hums outside.",
