    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the sky is draped in a soft haze, promising rain before dawn. With temperatures hovering around 52, then gradually lifting to a milder 54, a gentle south-southwest wind whispers through the city at 7 to 18 mph, occasionally gusting up to 29 mph. The air is heavy with the scent of impending rain, carrying a 90% chance of precipitation, though light\u2014less than a tenth of an inch\u2014suggests a delicate drizzle rather than a downpour. As the hours glide by, the clouds gather in quiet symphony, preparing for a nighttime serenade of soft drops.\n\nAs morning dawns, Thursday welcomes the city with sunny skies, where the sun\u2019s warmth is expected to rise to approximately 62 degrees, cooling slightly to around 60 in the afternoon. This transition beckons a day of clarity, as the fog recedes and the city\u2019s architectural charms emerge. Attire for this whimsical weather should embrace layers; a light jacket or sweater is advisable for the cooler hours of the early morning and late evening. With the sun brightening the day, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely visit to one of the many local caf\u00e9s could be perfect for savoring a warm beverage while basking in the lively yet soothing atmosphere of San Francisco. As the day unfolds, let the sunshine inspire simple pleasures\u2014perhaps a quiet read in the park or a wander through the farmer's market, letting the delightful energy of the city infuse your spirit.",
