    "weather_report": "North Perth wakes under a quilt of overcast, the light gentle and evenly spread, shadows erased into a soft matte. Sunshine will be scarce, with the sun a shy rumor behind the ceiling of cloud; the UV looks muted under this blanket, though spring has a way of slipping through, so sensitive skin may want a light touch of protection. The air feels quietly pleasant and the view clear enough, but with that painter\u2019s gray that makes edges look a little softened.\n\nFrom late morning into the afternoon the overcast is set to linger, a calm, dry, unhurried day rather than a sparkling one. Dress in light layers\u2014a comfortable tee with a thin jacket or long sleeve\u2014and leave the heavy shades at home. It\u2019s a fine morning for ordinary rituals: a stroll to the bakery, a loop around Hyde Park, browsing a bookshop, or tending a simple task in the shed. The kind of day where you ride the bike to a nearby errand and let the muted light do the thinking for you.",
