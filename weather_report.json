    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Netley with the streets lacquered by earlier showers and the sky pressed down in a soft, pewter lid. The sun is long gone and with it any hint of UV bite; what remains is a calm, damp air that smells faintly of salt and leaf. Light rain has come in fits, giving the lamps a halo and blurring the edges of things. It\u2019s not a clear night so much as a muted one, the horizon rubbed with charcoal, the Solent murmuring somewhere beyond the veil.\n\nExpect the rest of the night to stay mostly cloudy with the chance of another light patter or two, more nuisance than drama. It\u2019s a pleasant sort of gloom if you\u2019re dressed for it: a light waterproof with a hood, easy layers, shoes that don\u2019t mind wet pavements. This is weather for unhurried errands and small satisfactions\u2014wipe down the bike, sort tomorrow\u2019s bag, take a short stroll between showers to hear the rain ticking on hedges, then drift home to finish that half-read article. The day wasn\u2019t built for sun or spectacle, but it carries its own quiet charm if you move with it rather than against it.",
