The sky, once mostly sunny, has given way to a soft blanket of clouds, thickening in preparation for the rain that is expected to arrive shortly after nightfall. Temperatures are gently waning, resting around fifty-six degrees, yet will nudge upward as the night progresses. A faint breeze from the south-southeast whispers through the streets, stirring the anticipation of precipitation\u2014a promise underscored by a 100% chance of rain, with expected light showers contributing to a moist, refreshing cityscape.\n\nThe looming clouds herald a shift, yet the clarity of the day still lingers. The fog, a classic companion in these parts, may not blanket the city just yet, but its approach is imminent, as the marine layer begins to creep in. It would be wise to don a cozy layer or two, particularly something water-resistant, as you navigate this evening's endeavors. For those seeking warmth and shelter from the impending drizzle, an indoor activity\u2014perhaps a soothing evening at a local caf\u00e9, where the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee envelops you\u2014is a fitting choice amidst the backdrop of the season\u2019s chill. As the night unfolds, let the rhythm of San Francisco carry you into its embrace, wrapped in both warmth and awareness of nature's gentle touch.",
