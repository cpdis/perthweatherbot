    "weather_report": "In the early hours, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a soft shroud of clouds, with temperatures lingering in the low forties, a stillness only broken by a gentle east-northeast wind whispering through the streets. As the day unfolds, the promise of rain looms, casting a gray hue over the cityscape. By the afternoon, the clouds will thicken, and with nearly certain precipitation expected after four, it would be wise to keep an umbrella close at hand. The air will remain cool, with a high near fifty-four, making layers a sensible choice\u2014perhaps a lightweight jacket over a sweater, shielding against the dampness that will soon saturate the atmosphere.\n\nAs you navigate this typically moody San Francisco day, consider activities that embrace the indoor charm of the city. Explore the local cafes, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the comforting sound of raindrops on the window. Visit a bookstore and lose yourself among the shelves or catch a film in a cozy theater, where the solace from the rain can be fully appreciated. While the forecast may not herald the sunniest of days, there\u2019s beauty in the embrace of a rainy San Francisco afternoon that invites introspection and escape.",
