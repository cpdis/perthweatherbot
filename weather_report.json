    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Katy with a clean, unblemished sky, the kind of clarity that sharpens the edges of stars and quiets the streets. It feels calm and dry, a touch crisp without being unfriendly. With the sun long gone, there\u2019s no burn to worry about; the UV index is effectively asleep. The night looks trustworthy: clear now and holding that line toward midnight, the sort of night where porch lights look warmer and distant trains sound nearer.\n\nExpect this calm to carry into the small hours, setting the stage for a bright, uncomplicated sunrise and a likely sunny start; UV will stay low early and only matter once the morning stretches its legs. Dress with a light jacket or an easy sweater; a scarf if you plan to linger under the stars. Good moments tonight are small and ordinary: a slow loop around the block, checking the holiday lights, stepping out with a warm mug, setting out tomorrow\u2019s coffee kit, or hauling the recycling to the curb while the sky stays glass-clear.",
