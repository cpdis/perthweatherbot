    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the early hours are cloaked in a gentle veil of clouds, whispering tales of the cooler night air. The temperature will dip to a modest 46 degrees, inviting a soft tickle of a northeast breeze that drifts lazily around 7 mph. As dawn creeps into the city's embrace, expect the clouds to part and reveal a sunlit canvas, where temperatures will rise to a satisfying 58 before settling around 54 by the afternoon. This gradual transition suggests a day where the golden light glistens on the bay, though the cool air lingers, serving as a reminder of autumn's grip.\n\nAs the sun climbs, fog may still nestle low, particularly in the fringes near the Golden Gate. Its presence might hint at the marine layer that often embraces the coast, softening outlines, blurring edges, but not enough to dull the day's promise. For those venturing out, layers will be your allies: a light jacket over a casual shirt is ideal, ready to shed as you wander among bustling streets or meander through local nooks. This is a day beckoning you to explore\u2014perhaps a quiet stroll along the waterfront, savoring warming coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, relishing the ease of a chilly yet bright day.",
