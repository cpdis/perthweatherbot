    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of mostly sunny skies stretches across the horizon, nurturing an atmosphere that feels refreshingly cool, yet inviting. The temperature gently drifts near the low sixties, perfect for a brisk stroll or simply basking in the warmth of the sun. However, the anticipated drop as daylight begins its descent hints at a subtle chill, prompting a choice in attire that balances comfort and style\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a cozy sweater as you explore the city's charming streets.\n\nAs evening approaches, a shift is expected; the skies will gradually transition to a more muted glow, clouds gathering and wrapping the city in their embrace, ultimately bringing temperatures down to the low fifties. The gentle northwest winds whisper against the backdrop of the approaching nighttime ambiance, carrying with them the essence of the sea, a reminder of the coastal city's ever-present marine layer. It might be the ideal time to indulge in a quiet cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or perhaps find yourself wandering through the dimly lit streets, absorbing the unique character of the neighborhoods draped in evening shadows.",
