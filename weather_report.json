    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a soft, showery hush; the streets look lacquered, and the sky is the color of tin. Light rain is likely to slip through around dawn and linger into the morning, so the sun will be shy for a while and the UV low at this hour; if the cloud thins later, expect the UV to rise quickly even with only brief blue gaps. The day feels muted rather than gloomy, with decent visibility but a damp sheen on everything that softens the edges of distance and slows the pace of early errands.\n\nDress for drizzle and cool air: a light waterproof layer, closed shoes that won\u2019t mind puddles, and a compact umbrella for hands-free wandering between awnings. It\u2019s a good morning for simple comforts\u2014an unhurried coffee at a quiet cafe, sorting the week\u2019s notes at the kitchen table, or a tram ride to tick off small indoor errands while the showers pass. If you\u2019re set on fresh air, wait for a lull and take a short walk through the neighborhood; the gardens will smell clean and generous.",
