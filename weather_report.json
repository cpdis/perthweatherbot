    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a milky noon, the sun softened behind a thickening veil of cloud. It feels mostly dry for now, but light rain is likely to drift in from early afternoon and linger toward the commute, turning the light pewter and the air a touch cool and damp. Sunshine will be limited to brief, silvery breaks; UV is moderate around lunchtime when the sun slips through, then easing to low as the showers take hold. The day will look soft rather than crisp, edges blurred by cloud, with good visibility but little sparkle.\n\nDress for changeability: light layers with a waterproof you won\u2019t mind carrying, comfortable shoes that can take a splash, and sunglasses only if you\u2019re chasing those fleeting bright spells. If you\u2019ve errands or a stroll in mind, now is the moment before the sky closes in; later, think a quiet caf\u00e9 table, a library run, or tackling the sort of home task that pairs well with the patter of rain and a steady playlist. It\u2019s a gentle, get-things-done kind of day.",
