    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself cloaked in a damp, brooding atmosphere, with rain lingering in the air like an uninvited guest. The temperature rests in the low 40s, a chill that, combined with the murky clouds overhead, offers little more than a hint of brightness. Tonight, the whispers of rain are anticipated to intensify before the early morning hours, punctuated by a refreshing southeast wind that meanders through the streets. \n\nCome Wednesday, rain remains in the forecast, although it will grace the afternoon light with a gentle curiosity of fleeting sun. The day will unveil itself with a high flirting near 55, gradually surrendering to a cooler embrace by day\u2019s end. Visibility may remain poor, obscured by a thick marine layer, which hangs low like a wide ribbon of fog slithering across the hills. For those venturing into this quaint urban landscape, a warm jacket layered over a comfortable sweater would be prudent, perhaps a hat to deflect the impending drizzle. It might be a backdrop for a reflective stroll along the Embarcadero, where one can sip a hot beverage and watch the city lights shimmer through the haze as they intertwine with the distant sound of waves\u2014an ordinary day transformed into a quiet retreat amidst nature's touch.",
