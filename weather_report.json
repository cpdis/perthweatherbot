    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a soft tranquility blankets the city, ushering in a night of partly cloudy skies and a gentle chill settling around 49 degrees. The lingering light casts a muted glow across the urban landscape, the skyline standing proud yet calm, while a faint north wind whispers through the streets at around five miles per hour. The air feels crisp, tinged with the promise of a clear day ahead.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with golden sunshine, expected to rise near 63 degrees before taking a more subdued plunge to approximately 58 by afternoon. It will be a day to embrace the warmth, adding layers might be wise at first, but as the sun rises higher, lighter apparel will suffice. Beneath the expansive blue, the city beckons gentle pursuits\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through Dolores Park, where laughter mingles with the scent of fresh coffee, or a thoughtful visit to the nearby art galleries, where creativity dances in the light. The absence of fog tonight heralds clarity\u2014ideal for reflections on the bay and thoughtful conversations in cozy caf\u00e9s as the evening lingers on.",
