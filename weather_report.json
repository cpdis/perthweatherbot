    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco glows under a clean, untroubled sky, the sun still bright and crisp on pavements and leaves. Expect a clear, sunny close to the day, with only a few light clouds meandering in toward evening and no hint of rain; the air looks transparent and the light has that gentle gold at the edges. UV is easing but still has some bite this hour, softening as the sun tips down.\n\nIt feels quietly pleasant. Dress in breathable layers with sunglasses and a hat for any lingering sun, and tuck a light layer under your arm for after dusk. Good hours now for small, ordinary pleasures: a slow errand on foot, a meander through the neighborhood to stretch the day, watering the garden while the light mellows, or settling on the veranda with a book as the sky shifts from amber to blue-gray.",
