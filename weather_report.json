    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a gentle warmth graces the air, with bright sun spilling over the city like liquid gold. The morning feels crisp yet promising as temperatures flirt with the low sixties, offering an inviting embrace to those willing to venture outside. As the day unfolds, a mild drop to the late fifties may cover the city like a soft blanket. The light, playful wind whispers through the streets, barely noticeable, yet it adds to the ambiance of a day that refuses any notion of gloom.\n\nThe sky remains an expansive canvas of blue, unmarred by the usual fog that sometimes hugs the coastline. While wisps of marine layer linger quietly at the horizon, they seem to retreat, allowing the landmarks\u2014the Golden Gate Bridge and the storied skyline\u2014to shine undisturbed. This weather calls for a relaxed wardrobe; perhaps a light jacket will suffice for those wandering near the waterfront, while others can opt for comfortable layers that adapt to the pleasantly easing warmth. It\u2019s a splendid day for a stroll through the local parks or a leisurely visit to the nearby cafes, as sunsets over the bay promise a spectacular display, setting the scene for tranquil evening gatherings or solitary reflection under the fading light.",
