    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean, unblemished sky, the kind of blue that makes edges sharper and colors a touch more earnest. The morning is already bright and set to stay that way through late morning and into the early afternoon, with clear skies and crisp visibility. Expect the sun to feel increasingly insistent; UV will surge to very high around midday, so shade becomes a friend and lingering in direct light is best kept brief. The day reads as pleasant if you keep the sun at arm\u2019s length\u2014dry, sparkling, and uncomplicated.\n\nDress lightly and let the fabric breathe; add sunglasses, a broad-brim hat, and a confident sweep of sunscreen before stepping out. A short walk to the shops, a quiet coffee at a shaded table, hanging the washing while the light is good, or a tidy of the garden in the cooler corners all fit the mood. If you\u2019re heading out later, bring water and favor the tree-lined side of the street; the afternoon will be pure, bright, and a touch relentless.",
