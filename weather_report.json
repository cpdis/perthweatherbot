    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle hush blankets the city. The current temperature sits comfortably cool, hinting at the crispness that characterizes the early hours. The night sky, partly cloudy, whispers promises of clarity as the day unfolds, though the cool air is laced with the familiar essence of the bay. There is no dense fog to obscure the view; instead, a mild marine layer may linger at the fringes, ready to retreat as the sun kisses the horizon.\n\nBy midday, the sun is expected to embrace the concrete jungle, lifting the temperature to a pleasant 62 degrees. While it may dip slightly as afternoon approaches, the northeast winds will offer light dances, encouraging movement without chill. Dressing in layers will serve well\u2014opt for a light sweater or jacket to ward off the morning's brisk embrace, shedding it as the warmth rolls in. This is a day ripe for strolls along the waterfront or afternoon visits to cozy caf\u00e9s, where sips of coffee can be savored while observing the commotion of life. An invigorating hike through nearby parks may also beckon, with the sun illuminating the paths and invigorating spirits.",
