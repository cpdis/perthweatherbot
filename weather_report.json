    "weather_report": "A soft gloom envelops Downtown San Francisco this morning, with the forecast hinting at a symphonic performance of rain and thunder throughout the day. As the skies darken, hints of rain are suggested by droplets lingering in the air, thickening into a steady sheet before ten. The cityscape, with iconic landmarks shrouded in mist, takes on an almost ethereal quality, as clouds weave a tapestry of gray above.\n\nAs the afternoon unfolds, expect temperatures to concede the gentle embrace of warmth, sliding downward as the winds call forth the chill of the sea. The chance of precipitation looms at a staggering ninety percent, echoing the dramatic punctuation of thunderclaps and flashes of lightning that may grace the skies before the night settles in. Dress in layers: a water-repellent jacket paired with a cozy sweater, and don't forget sturdy, waterproof footwear to navigate the slick streets. As you contemplate the day ahead, perhaps lose yourself in the comfort of a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm beverage, or take a stroll beneath the canopies of trees, watching the rainfall mingle with the earth. While the weather may not lend itself to grand plans, it invites a reflective pause, a moment to embrace the beauty of a tempestuous city, cloaked in shades of gray.",
