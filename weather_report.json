    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself under a canvas brushed with scattered clouds, giving way to a somewhat serene evening. The temperature hovers around a cool 50 degrees, teasing the edges of warmth throughout the night, with a gentle north-northeast wind whispering through the streets at 14 to 23 mph. The atmosphere carries a hint of briskness, the kind that invites layers but also encourages a stroll beneath the stars.\n\nAs Wednesday dawns, the forecast promises sunlit expanses, with temperatures rising slightly to a pleasant 62, then retreating to the mid-fifties by the afternoon. The morning might greet the early risers with a clear vista, though the familiar marine layer may encroach as the day matures, veiling some of the distant hills. With the winds shifting to a calmer northeast, it is a delightful day best suited for leisurely activities. Don comfortable layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket or sweater\u2014to navigate the changing temperatures, and consider a mid-morning expedition to one of the city's many local caf\u00e9s, where the warmth of freshly brewed coffee lingers invitingly. A meandering walk along the waterfront might reveal the sparkling bay and the grace of the iconic bridges, especially as the sun bathes them in its golden glow. In the midst of such a splendid day, life feels as though it is weaving together moments of simplicity and beauty.",
