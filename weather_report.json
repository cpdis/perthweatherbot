    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is mostly open, a few small clouds idling like afterthoughts. The air feels calm and clean, the kind of quiet that sharpens distant sounds and makes streetlights seem warmer. UV is essentially absent at this hour, and the night looks clear enough for an unhurried stroll or to crack a window and let in a cooler breeze while you finish a chapter or sort out tomorrow\u2019s list. A light layer or soft cardigan will be enough if you step outside.\n\nThis gentle clarity is likely to linger into the early morning, promising a bright start with only scattered cloud to lend texture to the blue. As the sun climbs, expect stronger light and a UV that builds from mild to notably punchy by late morning if the clouds stay scarce; sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen will be wise, with breathable layers you can shed as the day warms. It looks like a pleasant day for ordinary errands done on foot, a coffee sipped outdoors, or a tidy-up of the balcony plants before the afternoon grows brighter.",
