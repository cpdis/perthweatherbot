    "weather_report": "Midday in Busselton arrives bright and unblinking: a cloudless vault, hard blue from shore to paddocks. The forecast holds to this clarity through the afternoon into early evening, so expect unfiltered sunshine and sharp horizons. UV will be strong through the early afternoon, the sort that turns a quick errand into a sunbath, easing as the sun tilts west. The air feels clean and dry, with colors a touch more vivid and shadows neat as a ruler.\n\nDress light and breathable, with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; sandals or easy sneakers will suit the pavements and the jetty boards alike. It\u2019s a good day to let a load of washing drink the sun, fetch a few groceries without lingering, or slip into the library for a cool half hour. Save the longer stroll along the foreshore or a gentle spin on the bike paths for late afternoon, when the light softens and the day turns from brilliant to kindly.",
