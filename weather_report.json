    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere hangs heavy with impending rain, cloaking the city in a blanket of gray. The damp chill of the air signals a day best navigated with layers\u2014a sturdy jacket layered over a warm sweater, perhaps accompanied by a scarf to ward off the brisk northeast winds. The chance of precipitation looms at a striking ninety percent, with drizzles anticipated to grace the streets soon, whispering the promise of a cozy evening indoors. \n\nAs the daylight wanes and clouds thicken, visibility appears limited, hinting at the presence of a marine layer veiling the landscapes to the north, obscuring the familiar contours of the Golden Gate Bridge. While the rain may cast a gloomy shadow over outdoor plans, this is an opportune time for quiet reflection or gentle pursuits. One could settle into a nook at a local caf\u00e9, the warmth of a hot beverage in hand, or meander through leisurely indoor spaces such as art galleries that invite exploration without the interruption of refrains from the outside world. The city's charm persists, even shrouded in mist, revealing beauty in its somber tones.",
