    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds, Downtown San Francisco is graced by a serene clarity, with sunlight illuminating the city\u2019s intricate fabric. The chill of the day clings gently, with temperatures hovering just near 54 degrees, gradually falling to a cooler embrace of 51 as the evening approaches. The golden hues of the sun play off the familiar silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge, while a light west-northwest breeze whispers through the streets, offering a soft consolation against the chill.\n\nTonight promises a mild retreat into partial cloudiness, where a low of around 42 casts a tranquil shadow over the stillness of the evening. The absence of fog allows for an intimate gaze across the bay; visibility stretches invitingly across the shimmering waters. For those venturing out, layering would be a wise choice\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a sweater, balanced with comfortable shoes for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. Seize the day by visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink, or meander through the vibrant streets, appreciating the unique charm that this city perpetually offers in its quieter moments.",
