    "weather_report": "Rottnest Island eases into late afternoon under a pewter sky, the sun mostly hidden and the UV mercifully low. Showers are gathering offshore and should slip across the island around sundown, softening the edges of the horizon and laying a salt-bright sheen on the paths. It feels gentle rather than grim: muted light, a bit of breeze, air that smells of seaweed and wet limestone. Expect a mostly grey, lightly rainy evening with only brief, pale glimmers of sun between clouds.\n\nDress for calm damp: a light rain shell over easy layers, comfortable shoes that won\u2019t mind puddles, and perhaps a cap to keep drizzle off your glasses. It\u2019s a good time for unhurried errands by bike before the rain sets in, a sheltered wander past the quokkas and tea-trees, or a quiet hour with a coffee near the jetty while the showers patter through. After dusk, lean into the coziness: a simple supper, a book, the soft thrum of rain on the roof.",
