    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco lies under a shroud of clouds, hinting at an impending drizzle. Rain, a light companion to the night, brings an atmospheric hush, settling in around the cool edges of 52 degrees. The city awakens to the promise of fog, a gentle and familiar presence lingering especially around the Golden Gate, where its tendrils stretch softly toward the bay. As the day unfolds, clouds will dominate, suggesting a muted skyline, with temperatures gradually falling in the afternoon, stirring a need for warmth.\n\nOn this damp Tuesday, those venturing outside should prepare for the light chill and dampness, perhaps choosing layers\u2014a cozy jacket paired with comfortable trousers. The likelihood of rain remains, merging seamlessly with the fog, creating a soft backdrop perfect for a leisurely stroll along Embarcadero, where the muted colors of the waterfront bloom gently into a palette of gray and blue. Alternatively, one might find joy in a quiet caf\u00e9, sipping a warm beverage while watching the city's rhythm from a window, where the drizzles dance and the fog weaves tales\u2014quite a delightful way to embrace this quintessentially San Francisco day.",
