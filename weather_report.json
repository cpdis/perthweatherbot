    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a gentle hush blankets the city, a transition of moods caught between the playful sun and the impending rain. The air is crisp, with temperatures delicately shifting as they flirt with cool breezes from the south. While glimpses of sunlight punctuate the cloud-draped sky, a robust 40% chance of rain looms, suggesting that this afternoon could transform from a somewhat inviting outing into a gentle shower. The Golden Gate stands watch, cloaked in a shroud of mist, with hints of fog whispering over the bay, particularly toward the bridges, reflecting the promise of rain yet to come.\n\nAs evening embraces the day, the atmosphere deepens with the certainty of rain, set against the backdrop of a mostly cloudy sky. With temperatures settling around a comfortable 51 degrees, the thick, plush clouds bring a lively energy, painting the horizon with shadows and reflections. For those venturing out, a warm jacket and perhaps an umbrella will serve as good companions. The tranquil streets beckon quiet exploration\u2014perhaps a stroll through the dimly lit neighborhoods where the scent of fresh coffee mingles with the promise of evening meals. Alternatively, one might find solace in the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9, indulging in a book as rain serenades the city.",
