Tonight\u2019s skies are partly cloudy, creating a tranquil scene that promises respite from the usual tumult. As the temperature hovers around a mild 45 degrees, the ambiance feels crisp yet inviting, perfect for a brief walk or an evening spent sipping warm cocoa while gazing at the twinkling city lights.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the day will unfold with a partly sunny demeanor, promising a high near 58. As the sun peeks through the clouds, the temperature is expected to modestly dip to around 55 in the afternoon, inviting a gentle breeze from the south-southeast. The fog, a familiar companion in these parts, remains coyly at bay, but not entirely absent; expect only a whisper of the marine layer that occasionally embraces the coastal vistas. This clarity, however fleeting, beckons one to layer up comfortably\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a jacket paired with a casual scarf. The day is ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, visiting quaint bookstores, or exploring the unique cafes tucked away in the Mission District. Engage in the simple pleasures that the city offers, with the crisp air and gentle sun providing the perfect backdrop for a pleasant day ahead.",
