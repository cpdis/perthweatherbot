    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the sky feels sealed, a pewter lid lowered over quiet streets; the air has that soft, mineral scent that announces rain on the way. Expect a grey morning at first light and a drift of light showers by mid-morning, the sun mostly a rumor behind the overcast. UV stays low early and, unless the ceiling thins, remains muted; if a brief opening appears later it may sharpen quickly, but for now the day looks subdued and gentle on the eyes, with edges softened and colors dulled to calm tones.\n\nDress for a cool, damp start: a light waterproof or trench over breathable layers, closed shoes you don\u2019t mind getting speckled, and an umbrella that fits the bag. This is a morning for ordinary comforts and short errands\u2014an amble to a bakery, a quiet perch by a cafe window, a library run, clearing the inbox while the rain ticks at the panes, or a short stroll under shop verandas between showers. Runners and early cyclists will appreciate a cap and a thin shell; everyone else can keep a compact rain layer handy and let the day unspool at an easy pace.",
