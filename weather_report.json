The sun is a rumor behind the cloudbank, giving the day a soft, silvery cast with a low, forgiving UV index. Edges blur a little at the horizon; the air feels cool and slightly damp, the kind of gray that hushes traffic and makes the river look thoughtful.\n\nThe rest of the day leans toward mostly cloudy, with the chance of a stray sprinkle keeping the pavement honest. It\u2019s not harsh, just gently uninviting unless you dress for it: a waterproof shell over a warm layer, trousers that don\u2019t sulk at brushy puddles, shoes with grip, and an umbrella you won\u2019t mind carrying. Good weather for modest ambitions\u2014an amble to a neighborhood bakery, a lap through the library stacks, unhurried errands, or a tidy-up at home with the window cracked to let in the cool, clean smell of rain. If you need movement, a short, steady walk between showers will suit the mood.",
