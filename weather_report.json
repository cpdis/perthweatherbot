    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco feels tempered, the light turning silvery as clouds gather; a light shower looks set to drift through early afternoon before the sky loosens into ragged, broken cloud toward evening. Sunshine will be scarce and fleeting, more a shy gleam between curtains than a blaze; UV still has a little bite around lunchtime when the sun slips out, but cloud cover should blunt it as the day wears on. The scene is gentle rather than grim: damp pavements, color-saturated leaves, and cleaner air once the rain brushes through. A light waterproof or compact umbrella is wise, with breathable layers and shoes you don\u2019t mind getting sprinkled. Thread errands between showers, linger over a coffee or late lunch by a window, browse a bookshop or small gallery, then take a short stroll after the rain when the streets exhale and the jacarandas toss a few violet petals into the gutter. By late day, expect calm, diffuse light and an easy tempo.",
