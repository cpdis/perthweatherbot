    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle curtain of clouds wraps the city, promising rain in the early hours. With temperatures hiccuping around the 43-degree mark and expected to rise slightly, there\u2019s a damp chill in the air. The southeast wind whispers its presence, nudging the remnants of daylight into twilight, while the prospect of a light drizzle looms just beyond the horizon. You might sense the city's heartbeat quieting, enveloped by a soft haze that hints at moisture but is yet to fully manifest.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, expect the rain to make its debut, gently falling after the morning hours. Though partly sunny intervals may dance through the clouds, that high of 55 degrees will wane as the afternoon progresses. It's a day best approached with layers; a reliable jacket should keep you cozy against the breeze while a light sweater will serve well as warmth gives way to coolness. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the distant clinks of evening sails mingle with the calming sound of waves, would be a fitting escape. Or venture into one of the cozy caf\u00e9s for a warm drink, where the outside drumming of rain becomes a soothing backdrop to quiet conversation.",
