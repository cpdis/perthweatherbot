    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a serene clarity, punctuated by a gentle whisper of wind from the south-southwest. The evening chill wraps around you like a soft blanket, inviting a moment of quiet contemplation beneath a starlit sky. As the temperatures settle around 46 degrees, the air feels crisp, yet comfortably refreshing, perfect for wrapping up in a light jacket or a cozy sweater.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise to cast a bright golden hue over the city, warming the streets to a pleasant high near 58, though a slight afternoon descent toward 55 will remind us of the lingering winter chill. The absence of fog suggests an untroubled horizon, perfect for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or sipping coffee in an outdoor caf\u00e9, basking in the mild light. As the day unfolds, the north wind may raise a gentle shiver, indicating the need for layers, but nothing too burdensome. For those contemplating the day\u2019s routine, it\u2019s an ideal time to explore a hidden gallery or revisit that favorite bookstore, embracing the city's artistic spirit under a clear sky.",
