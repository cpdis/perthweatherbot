    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the night, Downtown San Francisco finds itself perched on the edge of a mild drizzle, with only the faintest traces of rain making their presence known before dawn breaks. As temperatures hover around the mid-forties, a gentle northeast wind tugs at the edges, hinting at the chill lingering in the shadows of the city. A sparse scattering of clouds drifts lazily across the horizon, offering reassurance that the sun will soon reclaim the stage. \n\nAs day unfolds, the promise of a sunny spell arrives, beckoning the mercury to rise toward the comfort of fifty-seven degrees. The sunlight will unfurl across the skyline, casting a warm glow upon the streets, turning the damp remnants of the night into glistening memories. With the winds softening slightly but still noticeable, it would be wise to bundle up in a light jacket, perhaps layered with something a touch cozier for the brisk morning air. Amidst the brilliance of the day, a stroll along one of San Francisco\u2019s less trodden paths could offer an opportunity to embrace the beauty of the city waking up\u2014whether it\u2019s exploring a quaint cafe in the Mission or wandering through the serenity of Golden Gate Park, today encourages moments of quiet reflection and simple joys.",
