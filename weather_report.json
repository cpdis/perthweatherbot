    "weather_report": "Midday settles in with a pewter light over Rottnest, the sun pressed thin behind a quilt of cloud. Any sunshine will be brief and soft, with UV likely subdued under the overcast, edging toward moderate only if the cloud thins. The air feels cool and salt-bright; horizons are smudged and the water carries that bruised, blue-grey sheen that comes before weather. Expect showers to build into moderate rain through mid-afternoon, easing to lighter, lingering bursts toward evening, with a restless onshore breeze tugging at sleeves.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for comfort over bravado: a light waterproof shell over breathable layers, long pants, and shoes with grip; a hood will serve you better than an umbrella near the coast. If you\u2019re out, keep to the leeward paths for a short wander before the heavier showers arrive, then retreat to somewhere warm for a quiet hour with a book, a sketchpad, or the simple sport of people-watching. When the rain slackens later, step back out to admire the polished rocks and the softened palette of sea and sky, or take a few gentle photographs of the island in its moody afternoon suit.",
