    "weather_report": "The air tonight in Downtown San Francisco carries a gentle crispness, reminiscent of a peaceful evening. With temperatures settling into the low 40s, a subtle chill lingers, inviting a cozy wrap of layers\u2014perhaps a soft sweater beneath a light jacket. The skyline is laid out in a tapestry of city lights under a clear sky, each twinkling beacon a reminder of the charm that rests within this urban landscape. There's a notable absence of fog, the typical marine layer kept at bay, making way for an unobstructed view of the stars peeking through the cool night.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the radiant sun will usher in a day that feels like a gentle embrace, with temperatures inching towards the mid 60s. The clear, bright sky promises ample opportunity for modest outdoor pursuits\u2014a stroll along the Embarcadero or quiet moments in one of the city's lovely parks. As the sun makes its ascent, the breeze will lightly whisper through the trees, urging a casual elegance in attire; perhaps light layers that can be shed as the warmth envelops. This is a day that beckons to be embraced, where coffee on an open terrace can be savored and moments can be found in the simple charms of everyday life.",
