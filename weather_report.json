The sky is partly shrouded, the low temperature offering a crisp touch at around 48 degrees\u2014an invitation to layer up in a warm jacket or a woolen scarf. The brisk northwest winds are painting an energetic brushstroke at 12 to 18 miles per hour, with gusts audibly asserting themselves, reaching up to 31 mph. As the chance of precipitation lingers at 60%, an umbrella could serve as both a shield and a companion for a stroll through the brisk, rain-kissed city.\n\nTomorrow promises a clearer chapter, as the sun graces the day with a high near 58 degrees, gradually descending to a more subdued warmth in the afternoon. The winds will calm slightly, still holding a noticeable presence. The beauty of the city will be revealed in its detail, inviting exploration beyond the hustle of crowded tourist spots. As the fog settles in its slumber, one might find solace in a corner caf\u00e9, holding a warm beverage, or meandering through the quieter neighborhoods adorned with twinkling lights. This time of evening, with the fading light and rich atmosphere, might inspire an evening spent contemplating the sensations of the day, ideally wrapped in layers that blend comfort with style, against the coolness of the encroaching night.",
