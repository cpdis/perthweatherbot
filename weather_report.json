    "weather_report": "As a quivering mist cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the evening air is thick with the promise of rain, grim but mesmerising. Tonight, Drizzle will weave through the cityscape, softening the outlines of familiar landmarks under a curtain of clouds. The temperature will hover around the cool touch of 47 degrees, whispering a gentle reminder of warmth required to ward off the creeping chill of the south-southwest wind. With an 80% chance of precipitation, expect a light, persistent drizzle that might dampen plans for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or any open-air dining. Instead, the enveloping clouds may leave the Golden Gate Bridge shrouded in mystery, a shimmering silhouette against the night.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the promise of rain intensifies with relentless showers arriving before the day settles in. The skies will remain heavily overcast and the high will barely break 56 degrees, with temperatures gradually dropping in the afternoon. A brisk southeast wind will carry gusts that excite the senses, warning against any rash decisions to explore the hills without adequate layers. The day will beg for cozy interiors, perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 with steaming cups of coffee and the comforting embrace of friendly chat, or curling up with a book while the rain courses down windowpanes outside. Dressing in layers, with a reliable rain jacket and perhaps even a scarf, would invite a sense of comfort in the dismal but intimate atmosphere. For those feeling adventurous, a scenic drive through the city\u2019s misty corners might reveal the hidden beauty of this moody weather, where the stark groom of the streets holds an unexpected charm.",
