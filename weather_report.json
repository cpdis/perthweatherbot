    "weather_report": "In the heart of San Francisco, twilight settles gently into the night, draping the city in a cloak of low-hanging clouds and the promise of rain. The drizzle whispers against the pavement, a rhythmic lullaby, as the temperature begins its subtle ascent, lulling the senses into a cozy embrace. A south wind carries the salt-kissed air from the bay, brushing past with a hint of intrigue, while the looming cloud cover envelops the iconic skyline and softens the sharp edges of the cityscape. \n\nAs dawn approaches, the promise of a gray day unfolds. Drizzle will persist, morphing into a steadier rain, wrapping the streets in a shimmering wet veil. The atmosphere, heavy yet comforting, calls for layers\u2014perhaps a thick sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, accompanied by sturdy shoes to navigate the slick sidewalks. With such weather, the outdoors may feel less inviting; however, the warmth of a local caf\u00e9 offers an excellent alternative. Picture yourself nestled by a window, coffee in hand, watching the world blur slightly through the glass. Perhaps an art exhibit or a stroll through a bookstore will suit the mood, where the indoors can become an oasis while the city dances in the rain outside.",
