    "weather_report": "Floreat settles into a clean, ink-blue night, the sky swept bare of cloud and the heat of day slipping quietly out the door. The sun is long gone, so UV is essentially nil now; what you have instead is clarity, the kind that sharpens edges and invites unhurried breaths. It feels calm and politely pleasant, the sort of evening where footsteps sound softer and time loosens its tie.\n\nThe forecast keeps the canvas clear through late night and into the small hours, so expect an easy, restful stretch. Dress for a gentle cooldown: a light tee with a soft layer at hand if you linger outdoors. If you\u2019re up for it, take a slow walk around the block, let the house air out, or finish those last easy chores with a window open. If you\u2019re planning an early start, set out sunscreen and a hat; under clear skies here, morning light tends to arrive bright and the UV climbs quickly once the sun is up.",
