    "weather_report": "Evening in Subiaco arrives damp and reflective, with light rain brushing the streets and the sky sealed in a dull pewter lid. Sunshine has been scarce and shy; the day never quite brightened, and the UV stayed low, fading to nothing now after dusk. The air is mild rather than cold, but the wet gives everything a softened edge\u2014headlights bloom, stone darkens, and the horizon feels close. Showers linger through the evening and slip into the night, more whisper than drumbeat.\n\nA light waterproof or trench, closed shoes, and a small umbrella will serve you well; pockets for a handkerchief and a bit of patience won\u2019t hurt either. It\u2019s a night for ordinary comforts: a slow errand to the corner shop, an unhurried dinner, wiping down the bicycle, or tidying the week\u2019s scattered notes while the rain ticks at the sill. Not a day for sun-chasing, but a gentle one for keeping your own company and letting the city hush.",
