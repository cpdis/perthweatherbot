    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon offers a refreshing clarity that brightens the city's iconic skyline. The atmosphere feels delightfully calm, with a gentle breath of wind flowing in from the northwest, complementing the gentle warmth that hovers near 63 degrees. As the sun sinks lower, that warmth subtly gives way to the crispness that defines a San Francisco evening, cooling down to around 49 degrees. The forecast promises a mostly clear night, the twinkling lights of the city and stars above reflecting a serene beauty that prompts one to linger outside just a little longer.\n\nWith little sign of fog along the shores or above the skyline, the marine layer isn\u2019t making its usual appearance today. This makes it an ideal afternoon for a leisurely stroll around the waterfront, perhaps indulging in an artisanal coffee while watching boats sail across the bay. A light jacket or sweater should suffice for warmth as the evening progresses, perfect for cozying up alongside friends or enjoying a quiet spot in a park. The day invites simple pleasures, whether it's catching a glimpse of the Golden Gate or simply savoring the vibrant pulse of the city in the fading light.",
