    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the morning begins under a shroud of cloudy gray, with a gentle chill that whispers of moist air lingering in the atmosphere. The temperature, a cool 44 degrees, hints at an impending shift as the day unfolds. Rainfall is expected, a prelude to more robust showers and the possibility of thunderstorms as the daylight progresses. With unsettled skies overhead, the winds will occasionally stir up to 17 mph, presenting a brisk reminder of the day\u2019s tumult.\n\nAs you venture outside, it's prudent to dress in layers; a light waterproof jacket will serve you well against the impending rain, while a cozy sweater underneath will keep the chill at bay. The marine layer may hang low over the bay, obscuring views of the bridge, making it a perfect day for a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or diving into the pages of a good book while the world outside dances with raindrops. There's a certain charm in the sound of rain on pavements; embrace the tranquil ambiance of a city awash in gray. The day is not only about bracing against the elements but finding solace amid it.",
