    "weather_report": "As the first light of dawn approaches, Downtown San Francisco wears a tranquil embrace of clarity, with the sky mostly clear and a refreshing chill in the air. The low temperature that lingers at around 43 degrees nudges those still under covers to rise slowly, perhaps dreaming of sunshine and the gentle stirrings of a new day. As the sun climbs higher, expect a warming touch that nudges us toward a high near 61 degrees, transforming into a comfy afternoon where the breeze whispers softly from the north-northeast.\n\nWhile the forecast hints at a cheerful sun overhead, the typical San Francisco fog remains at bay, leaving the city\u2019s iconic outline exposed to its admirers. This is a day for enjoying the vibrancy of urban life without the chance of unruly clouds or mist. Clad in layers, perhaps a light sweater or a long-sleeved shirt topped with a jacket for the morning chill, one might embark on a stroll through filled streets or find a quiet nook in one of the city's ambient parks. As mid-morning yields to the gentle warmth of the afternoon, it invites opportunities to sip from a cafe terrace or to wander along the waterfront, indulging in the understated cadence of the city awakening around you.",
