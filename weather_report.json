    "weather_report": "As the twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a solid blanket of clouds looms above, signaling the onset of an evening drenched in rain. With temperatures languishing just above the dew point, the air carries a crisp chill that hints at the impending rainfall, which is set to drench the streets throughout the night. The winds stirring from the northwest offer little charm, rustling through the branches while adding a brisk sharpness that grips the skin. The certainty of a 100% chance of precipitation creates a moody ambiance, a perfect setting for cozy evenings indoors.\n\nCome Wednesday, the sun may poke through after the morning drizzle, embracing the city in gentle sunshine, though the high will only venture near 54. The clouds might keep lingering, making the clarity somewhat marred, particularly as the fog nestled along the bay lingers in the distance. Dressing in layers will be essential; a comfortable sweater under a water-resistant jacket will keep one prepared for any lingering dampness as the day unfolds. With the combination of the chill and the promise of a clearer afternoon, those seeking solace might find pleasure in a quiet caf\u00e9, sipping warm drinks and watching the world glide by outside. Alternatively, a visit to the local bookstores or galleries could provide a sanctuary from the weather while indulging in the city's rich cultural fabric.",
