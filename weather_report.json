    "weather_report": "As the night blankets Downtown San Francisco, the air remains distinctly crisp and invigorating, a reminder of the city\u2019s proximity to the sea. Tonight, the sky is clear, with the temperature gracefully settling around forty-two degrees. There\u2019s a soft north-northwest wind whispering through the streets, carrying with it the promise of a serene night. These golden moments on the cusp of dawn, where shadows dance with the emerging light, reflect a tranquil promise for the day ahead.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise gently over the bay, ushering in a sunny day that will warm the city to about fifty-five degrees. Though temperatures will dip slightly in the afternoon, the brightness will wrap the surroundings in a cheerful embrace. For those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater should suffice in the early hours, only to be cast aside as the sun reaches its zenith. The conditions are ideal for a daytime stroll along the Embarcadero, where the waters of the bay sparkle like scattered diamonds under the sun\u2019s watchful gaze. Alternatively, one might find solace in a quiet caf\u00e9, where the warmth of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the aroma of baked goods\u2014a perfect way to savor the calm before the bustle of day unfolds.",
