    "weather_report": "As the morning sunlight timidly begins to emerge through the languid curtain of retreating clouds over Subiaco, it seems the remnants of an earlier light rain still cling affectionately to the day like a gentle whisper of spring. The light, having broken free from its cloudy cocoon, casts a subdued glow over the verdant landscape, hinting at an ambiguous dance between the sun and the fleeting veil of moisture. The air, touched by the lingering mist, carries a cool embrace, perfect for leisurely morning strolls along the leafy paths or simply easing into a contemplative nook with a comforting book. Though the sky wears a muted palette, the mood is one of tranquil expectation, with the possibility of sunshine tipping its hat later in the day. As you step outside, a light sweater worn over your favorite tee seems ideal, a reminder of the softness that lies between seasons.\n\nIn this soft cocoon of morning, let your plans unfold slowly. Perhaps it's the perfect day for tending to your garden, letting the earth slip between your fingers as the sun amiably joins you. Or consider a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9, where the stories of rain and shine are traded over frothy cups of cappuccino. However you choose to spend it, this day, with its quiet revelations and softly shifting light, promises an understated beauty that whispers to those willing to listen.",
