    "weather_report": "Perth leans into late afternoon with a clean, open sky; the light is honeyed and uncomplicated, and the day still holds warmth that feels friendly rather than fierce. Sunshine remains the main act for the next hour or two, with just a few modest clouds set to wander in toward evening. UV has eased from its midday sting, but there\u2019s still some bite if you linger outdoors before sundown\u2014hat, sunglasses, and a lick of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray; later, a light layer over a tee will be enough as the air settles. It\u2019s a pleasant, clear-sighted kind of day: good for hanging the last load of washing, fetching groceries on foot, a slow lap along the river or through familiar streets, or watering the garden while the light fades. Expect twilight to be calm and gently mottled, the sky losing its hard blue for a soft scatter and an unhurried close.",
