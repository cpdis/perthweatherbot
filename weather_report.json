    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush before dawn, the sky mostly clear and pale as a kettle starting to sing. Early light will arrive clean and sharp, then a band of passing showers looks likely to slip in by midmorning, softening edges and leaving a sheen on footpaths. Expect a bright first act with a muted second; the UV will climb quickly once the sun is up, and even with cloud and light rain, brief breaks can still nip at unprotected skin, so a hat and a swipe of sunscreen won\u2019t be wasted.\n\nDress in light layers with a packable rain shell, and shoes that won\u2019t sulk at damp pavements. If you\u2019re up now, a quick stretch of the legs through quiet streets before the sprinkle would feel honest and calm; after that, let the showers steer you toward a warm caf\u00e9 on Rokeby Road, a small grocery run, or a tidy-up of errands that don\u2019t mind a bit of weather. When the rain eases, a short wander through the gardens or a bookstore browse will suit the day\u2019s gentler tempo.",
