    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a partly cloudy sky, its slate gray tint blending with the soft glow of streetlights still flickering in the pre-dawn darkness. The air is crisp and cool, holding the promise of a brisk day ahead. With a low temperature lingering around the lower forties, a light jacket and a scarf will serve you well against the west-northwest winds that rustle the leaves and whistle through the narrow streets, offering a gentle reminder of the season's shift.\n\nBy mid-morning, the sun will rise to greet the city, nudging the thermometer toward a moderate high of 59 degrees. The forecasts hint at a retreat of the marine layer, allowing clarity of vision toward the Golden Gate Bridge, though a whisper of fog may linger in the distance near the coast, creating an ethereal backdrop to your morning stroll. As the day unfolds, the gentle breeze will carry with it a blend of urban smells\u2014fresh coffee from the local caf\u00e9s mingling with the salty tang of ocean air. Dress in layers, perhaps donning a smart cardigan over a tee, perfect for a leisurely walk through the parks or along the waterfront, relishing the way the crispness invigorates your senses. The day beckons for a quiet exploration, maybe a visit to a local gallery or the unwinding by the bay, where the sun dapples the water with golden glimmers, promising a pleasant experience in a city that never ceases to charm.",
