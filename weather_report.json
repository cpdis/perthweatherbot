    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with a brisk clarity, marked by the sun reaching just above the horizon. You can expect the temperatures to hover in the mid-fifties, a subtle drop as afternoon approaches. The gentle north-northeast winds whisper through the streets, stirring a refreshing chill that hints at the morning\u2019s stillness. Tonight promises a continuation of this tranquility, with the skies remaining mostly clear, ideal for those who cherish an unobstructed view of star-lit wonders. \n\nIn these moments of clarity, the city\u2019s vibrancy shines; yet, a hint of the marine layer persists in the distance, a gentle reminder of the ocean\u2019s embrace. The fog may linger offshore, teasing the skyline with whispers of its presence, but for today, it appears reluctant to invade the streets. As you step outside, a light jacket would serve you well, perfect for transitions through the day and into the cooler night. Consider taking a quiet walk through the neighborhood or enjoying a coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where warm conversation fills the air, complementing the crispness of the day ahead.",
