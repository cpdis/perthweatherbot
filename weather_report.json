    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is basking in the gentle embrace of a bright and clear Thanksgiving Day, with the sun casting a warm glow over the cityscape. As the afternoon progresses, temperatures are delicately slipping from the heights of 58 degrees, settling around a more comfortable 55. The light, north-northeast breeze adds a refreshing touch, barely rustling the leaves as it meanders through the streets, creating a serene atmosphere for residents and visitors alike. \n\nAs the sun begins its descent, the evening will usher in a blanket of clouds, with temperatures dipping to about 46 degrees, perfect for those who enjoy a crisp, cool night. With the absence of fog and the clarity of the day, this is an opportune time to relish a walk along the Embarcadero or to sit on a cozy terrace, sipping warm beverages while watching the sunset turn the sky into a watercolor palette of oranges and pinks. For today, dressing in layers will best suit the changing elements\u2014perhaps a light jacket for the brisk breeze and a scarf to enjoy as the day melts into night. Embrace the beauty of San Francisco; take a moment to absorb the tranquility of the city in this perfect blend of clarity and calm.",
