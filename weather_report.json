    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts its gentle light over the city, even as hints of clouds linger in the distance. With temperatures settling around a crisp 55 degrees, the air feels clear and invigorating, though a subtle chill remains\u2014ideal for those seeking a refreshing stroll. The west wind, soft yet persistent, brings a whisper of the ocean, promising a transition to a cooler evening where temperatures will dip to approximately 45 degrees under a partly cloudy sky.\n\nAs the daylight wanes, the scene beckons for leisurely pursuits. A visit to one of the cozy coffee shops nestled among the vibrant streets may serve as the perfect companion to this beautiful but brisk afternoon. Perhaps a light jacket or a sweater will offer comfort against the cooling air, inviting passersby to linger longer in the inviting atmosphere. For those who appreciate the outdoors, a stroll along the waterfront, where the fog has yet to fully embrace the city, could be quite enchanting, allowing one to savor both the serenity and the scenic beauty of San Francisco\u2019s iconic skyline.",
