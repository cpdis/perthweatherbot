    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a scrubbed, enamel-blue sky, the sort of clear that sharpens edges and lifts moods. Even now the sun has some bite, and the day is set to stay cloudless from late morning through the afternoon. Expect brilliant sunshine with a very high, likely extreme UV index around midday; visibility crisp, shadows clean, the air feeling lean and bright rather than soft.\n\nDress light and breathable, with a wide-brim hat, sunglasses, and unapologetically generous sunscreen; a water bottle belongs in hand. It\u2019s a fine morning for a quick coffee walk or to run an errand on foot before the sun leans in. By lunchtime, favor a shaded veranda or the quiet refuge of the library, then let laundry or a few herbs bask in the dry light. When the glare mellows later, a gentle loop through the park or a slow ride to pick up groceries will fit the day\u2019s temperament.",
