    "weather_report": "Across the starlit expanse of Subiaco, the present drizzle seems to be doing a duet with the plights of night and a promise of relief lingers in the air. The soft patter of rain falls lightly but persistently onto the brimming streets in an age-old lullaby told and retold by every droplet. Earlier twilights were host to similar showers; a delicate wisp of mist that turned everything into a tranquil postcard bringing peace to every beholder.\n\nToday, the sun may have hidden behind a gray-cloaked muster of clouds, painting the suburban panorama with hues of tranquility. The invisibility of UV rays adds its rhythm to the melodious composition of a soothing day. The day was a melodrama between visibility and obscurity, although, the world outside remains clear enough to unhindered admiration and exploration, making it an epitome of a day made for lovers of rain. In this soft symphony of nature, wearing something to keep warm and dry would be the most ideal choice. Subtly waterproof jackets, cozy long sleeves, or perhaps layer up those loose cardigans and, don't forget to synchronize it with the rainboots singing the songs of frogs and lily pads. \n\nDespite the weather's playful invitation to stay curled up indoors, there's always the opportunity to enjoy the simple magic of rain. Strolling through the neighborhood streets with an umbrella twirling in your grip or stepping out on the porch with a warm cup of tea and watching the rain splash onto your garden could be wonderfully relaxing. But then, why not just dive into a novel, in tune with the droplets hitting your window, letting the tranquility wash over you and sooth your evening into a serene slumber? \n\nThis overcast evening sky in enchanting Subiaco favors the brave HTML color code , the muted glow of Light Slate Gray, that beautifully encapsulates the tranquility of a rainy evening.",
