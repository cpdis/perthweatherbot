    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a soft, muted light spills across the landscape, revealing a city embracing a gentle embrace of patchy fog. Early morning commuters will find the city draped in a veil of low clouds, lending a surreal quality to the urban scenery. The day promises to be partly sunny, though the cool air will keep temperatures around a rather crisp fifty-eight degrees, potentially dipping into the mid-fifties in the afternoon as the north wind whispers its way through the streets.\n\nTonight, the scene shifts dramatically, as rain heralds its arrival after ten. A thick layer of clouds will cloak the city, warm winds from the southeast hinting at the impending storm. As you prepare for the day ahead, layering becomes essential; a light sweater paired with a water-resistant jacket will serve well as the fog gradually yields to the promise of wet weather. Today is perfect for indoor pursuits; consider exploring one of the city's lesser-known museums, indulging in the rich tapestry of art and history, or sinking into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a good book as raindrops begin to dance on the windowpanes.",
