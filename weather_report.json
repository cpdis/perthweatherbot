    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of an early Subiaco morning, an intimate softness drapes itself over the city. The day has begun under a chorus of light rain, punctuating the calm with its steady rhythm. The hushed hues of the sky, cloaked in clouds, hold close their promises of rain yet to pour. Underneath this comforting blanket, the world waits, holding its breath in the tender quiet before the day truly begins. There's a certain hush - a sacred silence - that falls just after a rain, as if the world itself is taking a moment to savor the freshness. This kind of morning doesn't call for sunglasses, but rather wellies and a raincoat, a hat if you're fond of keeping your hair dry.\n\nAs daylight continues to animate the world, the gentle patter of rain persists, instilling a quiet tranquility in the heart of Subiaco. The day will not be a spectacle of brilliant rays and blinding clarity, but rather a soothing medley of grays and the comforting smell of wet earth. The soul of the day invites you to curl up with a good book, or perhaps take a leisurely stroll under the sheltering eaves of city buildings, letting the rhythm of raindrops serve as the soundtrack. The weather may not sing the tune of a brilliant, sunny day, but it hums a comforting melody of another beautiful day in Subiaco.",
