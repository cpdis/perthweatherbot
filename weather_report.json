    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon sun casts its warm embrace over the city, painting the scene with a brilliant blue that is both refreshing and invigorating. The air is crisp, with a gentle north wind stirring, promising to keep the atmosphere lively without overwhelming. As temperatures hover around a comfortable 61 degrees, a slight descent to the mid-50s invites a suggestion of layers. The absence of fog and the clarity of the day allow for sweeping views across the bay, a rare treat that makes the skyline's edges seem all the more defined. \n\nAs night approaches, a mostly clear sky will transform into a canvas of stars, with temperatures cooling to a cozy 45 degrees, rising slightly through the overnight hours. This pleasant evening will carry a whisper of the east wind, providing just enough chill to warrant a light jacket as you stroll the streets or settle into a favorite caf\u00e9. Tonight offers the perfect opportunity to explore quaint corners of the city or enjoy intimate conversations under the vast, open sky. Embrace the day\u2019s beauty with attire that balances comfort and touch of warmth, and let the San Francisco evening unfold at your own pace.",
