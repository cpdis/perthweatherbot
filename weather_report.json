    "weather_report": "Subiaco has eased into a glass-clear evening, the daylight\u2019s glare long gone and the streets washed in a gentle, unhurried calm. The afternoon looked bright and uncomplicated; now the sky is unmarked and star-hungry, the sort of clarity that makes edges feel sharper and sounds carry. Sunshine is done for the day and the UV has fallen to nothing, leaving the air to cool at its own pace without the bite of radiance.\n\nExpect the night to stay bare and tranquil, with no real cloud to speak of. It feels pleasant in that quietly restorative way; you\u2019ll want a light layer, a cardigan or easy jacket, perhaps closed shoes if you linger outdoors. This is a good hour for a slow lap around the block, a small errand on foot, airing out the house, or finishing the dishes with the windows cracked and the cricket-song drifting in. If you\u2019re unwinding on the veranda, bring a warm mug and let the clear night do the talking.",
