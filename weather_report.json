    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the early hours unveil a mostly clear sky, accompanied by a gentle whisper of a south wind. The air is crisp, a cool embrace as temperatures settle around a refreshing low. As the city stirs to life under the glow of morning light, a sense of clarity pervades the atmosphere. The forecast predicts a sunny day ahead, where vibrant blue skies complement the city\u2019s iconic landmarks. Anticipate a peak temperature near 56, gradually softening as afternoon approaches.\n\nDespite the promise of sunshine, a subtle marine layer lingers, hinting at the characteristic fog that often graces the Bay Area. Observers may notice wisps of low-lying clouds orchestrating a dance just beyond the bridges, an ephemeral reminder of the distinct climate of this coastal city. For those venturing outdoors, layering is advisable; a light jacket or sweater will greet the cool breeze while allowing for comfort as the day warms. A stroll through the quiet streets or a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9 would offer a perfect way to savor this serene morning, before the bustling energy rises with the day.",
