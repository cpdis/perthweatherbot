High temperatures hover around a comfortable 62 degrees, with a gentle northwesterly breeze weaving through the streets. The earlier mists have receded, leaving behind a vibrant canvas stretching from the Golden Gate Bridge to the skyline\u2014a sight that invites both the wandering eye and the wandering soul. \n\nAs the sun begins its descent, the chill will creep in, leading to a crisp night air that settles around 49 degrees. With only a smattering of clouds drifting above, this serene evening beckons you outdoors, perhaps for a quiet walk through the transformed streets where every corner whispers stories of those who walked before. As you venture out, a light jacket will suffice, allowing you to relish the cool air without sacrificing comfort. The only company you might need is a warm drink, best enjoyed while finding a cozy perch from which to watch the city transition into its nighttime cadence.",
