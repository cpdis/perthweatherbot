    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is a deep navy with only a few clouds drifting across it, the kind of quiet that makes streetlights look warmer than they are. Toward the small hours those clouds will gather into a more broken ceiling, so expect a muted, gauzy dawn rather than a blazing one. The night carries almost no UV burden, but after sunrise in mid-December here the UV will ramp up quickly and become strong to very high by late morning, even if the sun is filtered at times, so plan shade, sunscreen, and a brimmed hat. It looks like a pleasant day built of intervals: pockets of sunshine, spells of cloud, decent visibility without that crystal-clear glare. Light, breathable layers will suit the early breeze, with something you can shrug off once the day wakes up. Night owls might enjoy a slow stroll now when the streets are empty and the air feels unhurried; early risers could nurse a first coffee on the veranda and step out for errands or a gentle ride before the sun sharpens and the afternoon asks for patience and a pause.",
