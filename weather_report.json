    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night sky unfolds a tranquil tapestry of clarity, interspersed only by the soft shimmer of distant city lights. The chill of the evening air creeps in, a gentle reminder of the season, with temperatures softly settling into the low forties. A light, north northeast breeze finds its way through the streets, carrying hints of the ocean, yet there is no marine layer to obscure the city\u2019s charm tonight. The golden light from the bridge glimmers, reaching out across the bay, offering a warm contrast to the cooling air.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Friday, expect a gradual unveiling of the sun, casting its gentle rays over the cityscape. The pleasant daylight will beckon those who appreciate the quiet beauty of a mostly sunny day, perfect for exploring the corners of your neighborhood or indulging in a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9. Consider layering up in a light sweater or a denim jacket, ideal attire for both the warm midday sun and the crisp morning air. It\u2019s a splendid day for quiet walks along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to one of the city\u2019s storied parks, while wrapping yourself in the simple pleasures that San Francisco offers.",
