    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a dimmed sky, the light turned down to a pewter hush as showers gather on the late-morning horizon. Expect light rain to slide through around midday and linger into early afternoon, the sun mostly veiled behind a soft grey scrim. The day will feel quietly luminous rather than bright, edges blurred, roads glossed to a sheen. UV exposure should be muted by cloud, though a brief tear in the cover could still deliver a quick, sharp dose\u2014more a blink than a blaze.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for a light rain jacket and shoes that forgive puddles, a compact umbrella tucked at the ready. The air may feel a touch damp, pleasant enough for a gentle errand loop between showers or a slow walk to a caf\u00e9 window where the street can perform in reflections. Consider indoor errands, a browse through a bookshop, a midday train hop for a change of scene, or a late lunch under an awning listening to the softened patter. If the sky brightens for a moment, take it as a small invitation, not a promise.",
