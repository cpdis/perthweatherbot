    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the sky presents a canvas of clarity, albeit with a mild chill that drapes over the city. Tonight invites a mostly clear ambiance, marked by a gentle breeze from the north-northwest, whispering through the streets at about 6 to 15 miles per hour, occasionally manifesting in gusts that playfully tease at 25 miles per hour. The temperature lingers around 49 degrees, a reminder of winter's gentle grip.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, the sun promises to awaken the city with bright, sunny rays, reaching a peak warmth near 64 degrees\u2014but expect the afternoon to usher in a gradual cooling to 61, as if the day is gently wrapping itself in a sweater. While the wind stirs a bit more energetically at 16 miles per hour, with occasional stronger puffs, the overall atmosphere remains inviting. This crystal-clear weather, devoid of fog or marine layer, suggests a tapestry of blue skies, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, a quiet afternoon in one of the many charming caf\u00e9s, or perhaps a visit to a local gallery where art whispers tales of inspiration. Dress in layers, with a cozy jacket at hand, and embrace the simple pleasures of a San Francisco winter\u2019s day illuminated by the sun\u2019s golden glow.",
