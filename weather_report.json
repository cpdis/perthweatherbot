    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, enamel-blue sky, the sun already brightening verandas and jacaranda shade. The air feels dry and clean, with long, sharp visibility and little to trouble the horizon. Through late morning and into early afternoon the sky stays largely unblemished, a day that will warm quickly and glow with unapologetic sunshine. Expect the UV index to surge by midday, the kind that bites faster than you think, making the light both exhilarating and a touch severe in the open.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for breathable fabrics and easy layers, sunglasses and a brimmed hat, sunscreen as faithfully applied as your watch. If you\u2019re heading out, finish the brisk errands before noon, then move at a gentler pace: a short amble to the grocer, a coffee in the shade, a library visit, laundry on the line where it will dry in no time. Gardeners might water early and retreat to the pergola; cyclists can enjoy bright, forgiving streets so long as they keep to the shade when they can. Clear, sunny, and keenly lit, it\u2019s pleasant so long as you pay the sun its due respect.",
