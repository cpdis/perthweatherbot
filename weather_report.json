    "weather_report": "North Perth sits under a soft, unbroken lid of cloud at midday, the sun reduced to a pale smudge and the light turned silvery and calm. Shadows are rubbed out and the day feels quiet and contemplative, the sort of grey that invites a slower pace and a second thought.\n\nThe overcast looks set to linger through the afternoon and toward evening, so don\u2019t expect much in the way of sunshine; UV will be muted by the cloud but not absent, nibbling most in the early afternoon. A light long-sleeve or thin cardigan suits the mood, with comfortable shoes for ambling and perhaps sunglasses for the glare off bright concrete more than the sky. It\u2019s a good day for unhurried errands, a meander around Hyde Park, a lingering coffee by a window, or a detour to a gallery or library where the soft light feels right. Photographers will find the clarity gentle and even, a day that flatters colors without the sting of harsh contrast.",
