    "weather_report": "The gentle nighttime rain blankets Downtown San Francisco, embodying the city's romantic moody essence. As the clock tiptoes past midnight, temperatures linger around the 43-degree mark, softly cradled by an eastward breeze. The skies overhead are draped in a veil of clouds, promising glimpses of softer light as dawn approaches. Yet, before the sun's embrace takes hold, scattered showers may linger, teasing you with the possibility of a brighter afternoon.\n\nAs Wednesday dawns, the transition from ink-black to twilight reveals a hint of promise. Expect rain later in the morning, although these droplets will play a tender background note to a reprise of sun and clouds amidst the cool coastal air. Dress in layers; a light jacket will fend off the chill, while comfortable shoes are advisable for a stroll through the city's vibrant streets. It may be an ideal day for winding through art-filled aisles of a local bookstore or savoring a warm cup from your favorite caf\u00e9, allowing the tender whispers of rain to accompany your thoughts. The day beckons with a balance of coolness and the thrill of sporadic sunshine, a perfect canvas for both indoor refuge and brisk exploration.",
