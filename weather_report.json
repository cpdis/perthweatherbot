    "weather_report": "Subiaco has settled into a pure, unblemished night. The sky is a clean pane of glass, stars etched sharp, and the streets feel spacious and unhurried; no hint of cloud to soften the edges. Right now the UV is essentially absent and the darkness is kind to the eyes, the kind of clarity that makes distant lights seem nearer than they are.\n\nThis calm, clear spell looks set to hold through late evening and into the small hours. Under such open skies, when the sun returns it will be unfiltered and bright, with UV quick to strengthen as the morning matures. The weather feels quietly pleasant rather than bracing: step out in a light layer over short sleeves, and trade that layer for a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a dab of sunscreen once daylight takes hold. Tonight invites simple errands and gentle rituals\u2014a slow lap of the block, watering the pots, airing the house, finishing a page on the porch. It\u2019s honest weather, asking only that you move at your own pace.",
