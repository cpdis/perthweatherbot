    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks towards the night, Downtown San Francisco rests under a velvety sky, the clarity of the air creating a stark but serene contrast to the vibrant lights that twinkle like stars below. The low temperature, gentle at around 55 degrees, suggests a cool embrace, enhanced by a north wind that dances through the streets, gusting with a spirited vigor. Tonight, the atmosphere is an invitation to step outside, perhaps to stroll along the waterfront or share a quiet moment with friends at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where the sounds of the city meld with the joyful rhythm of evening life.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the sun will grace the city with its golden rays, bringing warmth and a high nearing 68 degrees. Expect the chill of the early hours to gradually vanish, leaving the freshly minted day ripe for adventure. A slight north-northwest wind will accompany this sunny promise, ensuring the air remains crisp yet pleasant. Ideal attire for this splendid Monday would be layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a soft shirt, easily shed by afternoon's embrace. With the forecast for blue skies unencumbered by fog, the day calls for mundane pursuits made extraordinary: a visit to a charming bookstore, a leisurely exploration of nearby parks, or simply a quiet moment spent watching the world unfold from a sunny bench. The marine layer is absent, leaving the iconic structures of the Golden Gate and the city's diverse architecture sharply defined against the brilliant backdrop of blue.",
