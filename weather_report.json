    "weather_report": "Midday in Houston arrives under a gauzy sky, the sun coming and going as scattered clouds thicken into broader patches. Light slips through in gentle sheets rather than sharp glare, so the UV feels tempered for December, though the noon sun still asks for a touch of sunscreen and maybe sunglasses when the breaks appear. The air reads clear, the horizon a little softened by the quilt of cloud, lending the day a calm, reflective mood rather than a dazzling one.\n\nExpect this mixed, partly to mostly cloudy character to linger through the afternoon with occasional bright openings. It\u2019s a day for light layers and a pocketable jacket, easy to shed when the sun tilts warmer. Consider an unhurried coffee run, a quiet stroll to mail something you\u2019ve been meaning to send, or a brief lap around the block between tasks. A museum hour, a bookstore browse, or reorganizing a corner by the window would suit the softened light. If you\u2019re out, errands will feel kinder without the blaze.",
