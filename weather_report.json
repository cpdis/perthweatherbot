    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a thick, brooding mantle of clouds, harboring rain that taps softly on rooftops and lingers in puddles. From the heights of Sutro Tower, one can sense the city\u2019s silhouette, softened by the dampness and blurred by the mist that weaves its way through streets and alleys alike. The air is laced with a chill, a reminder that winter still holds sway, and the gusty winds whisper tales of the sea, carrying the scent of rain and a hint of the briny Pacific. Visibility is reduced, as the city appears to huddle under its blanket of gray, the iconic surroundings both familiar and softened, rendering the Golden Gate a mere suggestion in the distance.\n\nAs the day presses on, expect little reprieve from the rain. With each passing hour, the chance of precipitation remains steadfast at 100%, and the temperatures will yield to a steadier coolness. A light jacket or a sturdy umbrella will serve you well if the outdoors beckon. Perhaps a leisurely walk in a nearby caf\u00e9 or a visit to a favorite bookstore would be prudent, allowing you to savor the cozy atmosphere while watching the world outside morph under the drumming patter of rain. Amid this quiet weather, one might find solace in a warm drink, as the landscape quietly sparkles with the freshness that rain brings, leaving a lingering hope for clearer skies to follow.",
