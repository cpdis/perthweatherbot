    "weather_report": "A gray lid hung over Katy through the morning and midday, and by night it has settled into a steady, unbroken ceiling. The sun never truly made an entrance, so the UV stayed muted; now it\u2019s effectively asleep, leaving the neighborhood washed in soft, streetlamp amber and a gentle hush. Visibility is fine but subdued, edges slightly softened, the kind of clarity that invites unhurried steps and quiet errands rather than spectacle.\n\nDress in easy layers: a light jacket or cardigan over long sleeves, comfortable shoes, maybe a cap if a faint mist toys with the air. It\u2019s not a night for basking, but it is pleasant in a contemplative way. Consider a short, reflective walk after dinner, a quick spin to the store for last-minute provisions, or a brief stop at a caf\u00e9 to finish a note, a list, a chapter. Let the evening be practical and calm, with small tasks done well under a calm, pewter sky.",
