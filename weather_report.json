    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds beneath a tapestry of mostly cloudy skies, hinting at the shifting weather ahead. Currently, the temperature hovers around a cool 58 degrees, gradually slipping toward a chillier 55. There's a gentle, southerly breeze stirring, whispering promises of change as the day progresses. As night approaches, the forecast reveals an impending rain, anticipated to arrive around 10 PM, with a 90% chance of precipitation. This will accompany a rise in temperatures to about 54, a stark contrast to the present coolness.\n\nThe day's ambiance evokes a subtle melancholy, with gray hues dominating the skyline. There may be patches of light, but the clouds loom thick, casting a subdued light over the bustling city. The marine layer may drift in from the bay, softening the outlines of the Golden Gate and cloaking San Francisco in a veil of mist that hints at the capricious nature of its weather. For those venturing outdoors, layering is advised\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a sweater, ready to embrace the cooler air as dusk descends. With rain on the horizon, exploring cozy cafes or indulging in a good book in a warm nook may be the perfect antidote to the afternoon chill.",
