Light showers are due to slide in around and after sunrise, softening the morning and muting the edges of the city; expect a hazy, matte clarity with the horizon a little smudged. Sunshine will be a reluctant guest today\u2014brief, pale breaks at best\u2014and with the cloud cover the UV should stay low, nudging toward moderate only if the midday brightens.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for a light waterproof and easy layers, closed shoes, and a small umbrella or hood stashed in a bag. The mood is gentle rather than grim: errands on the tram between passing showers, a quiet hour at the library, or a late-morning coffee while the streets glisten. If the rain eases later, take a brisk loop through the parklands and enjoy the eucalyptus waking in the damp. Drivers can unhurry their commute; cyclists might thank themselves for mudguards. Sunscreen is a modest idea if you\u2019ll be out through lunch, otherwise let the grey do the filtering.",
