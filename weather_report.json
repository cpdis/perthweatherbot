    "weather_report": "Before sunrise, Subiaco sits under a single sheet of cloud, the air damp and expectant. Overcast skies lead the morning and light rain drifts in not long after dawn, softening edges and muting colors. Sun will be shy today; any brightness will be brief and filtered, with the UV index staying low through the morning under the thick cover. It\u2019s a low-contrast kind of start, quiet and a little wistful, the sort of weather that hushes the streets and makes the world look freshly penciled-in.\n\nDress for the mist and spits: a light rain jacket, something with a hood, and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. It\u2019s a good morning for ordinary comforts\u2014an unhurried coffee while the showers patter, a tidy-up of the desk, a short errand run between drizzles, or a gentle walk when the rain eases, just to watch the town wake. If you\u2019re commuting, leave a touch early; if you\u2019re staying put, let the slow light set the pace.",
