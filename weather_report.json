    "weather_report": "Denmark slipped from a blanket of morning grey into a more generous noon, the cloud cover torn into ragged panels that let through a pale, forgiving sun. Light is diffuse and silvery rather than sharp, giving the day a soft-focus clarity where distances remain clean but edges feel gentled. Expect a mix of brighter spells and lingering cloud through the afternoon; sunshine will come and go, and the UV stays low enough that a hat is optional and sunglasses are more for comfort than duty.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of cool that invites layers: a light sweater under a jacket, perhaps a scarf for the breeze, comfortable shoes for unhurried steps. With rain looking unlikely, it\u2019s a good day for steady errands, a meander through a neighborhood market, or a quiet hour by a window in a cafe, warming your hands around a cup while the light drifts across the street. If you\u2019re out on a bike, take it easy and enjoy the breaks of brightness when they arrive; if indoors calls, a museum or a tidy-up of the bookshelf suits the calm, muted mood.",
