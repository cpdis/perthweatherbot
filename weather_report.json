    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a serene and sunlit morning. Bathed in a gentle glow, the skyline stands in stark contrast to the crisp air that lightly brushes against the skin. With temperatures expected to peak around 61 degrees, the day promises a refreshing warmth before the coolness settles in by afternoon. The blue expanse above is predominantly unclouded, exhibiting a rare clarity that invites exploration, while a soft breeze from the north northwest brings an invigorating touch, setting the stage for a day spent outside.\n\nThe absence of fog allows the iconic contours of the Golden Gate Bridge to emerge boldly, undraped by the usual veil of mist. This clarity reveals the city's intricate tapestry of architecture and coastline, beckoning you to embrace the day. As twilight approaches, temperatures will dip, eventually settling around a cool 44 degrees, suggesting a transition from the vibrant warmth of day to the intimate embrace of evening. A light jacket or layers will serve well as the air cools, fostering a sense of comfort. Given these delightful conditions, consider a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city's parks, where the day unfolds with the whispers of possibility.",
