    "weather_report": "As twilight drapes itself softly over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a cool, damp promise of rain. Through the dimming light, the cityscape is cloaked in a veil of moist clouds, reducing visibility and transforming familiar landmarks into shadowy impressions. Tonight, the warmth of the day slips away, with temperatures lingering around the low fiftys, while a brisk south wind rustles through the streets, stirring leaves and creating an atmosphere both alive and expectant. With a 90% chance of precipitation looming, it feels as if the clouds are preparing to release their bounty soon; drizzles may begin as early as ten o'clock.\n\nThe forecast for Wednesday reveals a continuation of this damp theme, with rain expected to persist through the day. The sky will remain a canvas of gray, casting a muted palette over the city. Highs will hover around fifty-nine, cooling by afternoon, as the relentless south winds pick up strength. In such weather, a comfortable jacket layered over a light sweater would be wise, along with sturdy footwear for navigating slippery streets. As this evening unfolds and the rain begins, perhaps cozy indoor activities beckon\u2014a visit to a local bookstore, where the scent of coffee mingles with the pages, or perhaps curling up with a film that mirrors the pensive mood of the night. Whether seeking solace indoors or venturing out into the refreshing rain, one cannot deny the allure of a city wrapped in its own foggy embrace.",
