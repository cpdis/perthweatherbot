    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm prevails. The sky remains mostly clear, embracing a soft chill that invites one to wrap up warmly. With temperatures dipping to around 49 degrees, a light northwest breeze whispers through the streets, hinting at the crispness of the night. The city lights twinkle like distant stars, offering a serene backdrop to an evening stroll, with the famous silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and city skyline quietly observing the world below.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the morning promises a canvas of bright sunshine, teasing the day with a high near 61 degrees. Yet, as the afternoon approaches, the warmth will gently retreat, bringing a cooling fog blanket, typical of this renowned coastal city. Layers will be your ally; a light jacket over a cozy sweater will keep the chill at bay while still allowing you to enjoy the outdoors. A leisurely weekend could unfold with a quiet visit to a neighborhood caf\u00e9 or a peaceful walk along the waterfront, where the mix of sunshine and cool breezes creates a delightful ambiance to savor a moment of calm.",
