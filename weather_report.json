    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco under an unblemished sky, the kind that makes streetlights look small and the stars pin-sharp. The forecast holds it clear through late evening and into the small hours, which means UV is effectively absent now; by contrast, under such spotless skies the daylight period is stark and sunny, with the UV index quick to surge once the sun is well up. It feels gentle and open tonight, the air clean and visibility long, a quietly pleasant end to a day that read bright and simple.\n\nDress lightly this evening with a soft layer over the shoulders; when the sun returns, think breezy fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. These are hours for small, unhurried tasks: a calm lap around the block, watering the herbs, taking the bins out, or finishing a chapter by the open window. Early in the morning, hang the washing and run to the shops before the glare grows bold.",
