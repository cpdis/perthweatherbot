    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a soft, slate-blue sky, the light thinned and pearly, with showers gathering their courage for late morning and into the early afternoon. The day looks cool and a touch wistful; the sun will make only brief, muted appearances, so brightness is low and the UV modest for winter, though a short midday break could still nip at bare skin. The air is clean and rain-laced, edges of the landscape slightly blurred, the world smelling of damp leaf and fresh pavement.\n\nDress for comfort and drizzle: a light waterproof jacket over warm layers, closed shoes, and an easy umbrella you don\u2019t mind opening and closing between passing showers. It\u2019s a good morning for errands under awnings, a slow browse through a bookshop, or a lingering coffee where the windows fog a little. If you crave a stretch, take a short walk when the rain eases; gardeners can enjoy the soil drinking deeply. Keep plans flexible, like the sky.",
