    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a clear, quiet sky at this late hour, the air pared back to its essentials and the streets whispering toward dawn. Forecasts keep the canvas spotless into the early morning, promising a bright, glassy start once the sun lifts; UV is negligible now, but will ramp up quickly after sunrise and run very high through late morning and early afternoon. Expect a day that feels clean-edged and sunny, with light sharpening every surface and heat gathering as the hours lengthen.\n\nIf you\u2019re awake, a gentle stretch or a slow lap around the block suits the cool pre-dawn; otherwise, plan to step out early for errands or a coffee before the sun turns assertive. Dress for contrasts: a light layer before first light, then breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and diligent sunscreen once the day wakes. It\u2019s a good morning to hang the washing early, water the pots, cycle to the shops, or settle by an open window with a notebook, letting the day brighten while you stay a step ahead of the glare.",
