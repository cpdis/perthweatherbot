    "weather_report": "Early morning in Downtown San Francisco reveals a tranquil stillness, with the air fresh and crisp, carrying hints of adventure. Under a clear sky, the city awaits the embrace of sunlight, poised to awaken as the day unfolds. The low temperature resting around 45 degrees offers a gentle chill that invites a cozy ensemble; a layered outfit with a light jacket will serve you well against the subtle whispers of the north northeast wind. \n\nAs the day progresses, expect the sun to grace the skyline, lifting temperatures to a comfortable 60 degrees, though the afternoon may feel a touch cooler as it dips to 56. The maritime influences might tease with whispers of morning fog, lingering in the coastal corners, but the day will mostly revel in clarity, allowing the charm of the Golden Gate and the vibrant city to sparkle in full view. One might find pleasure in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, savoring a warm cup of coffee as the sun ascends, or perhaps explore the hidden nooks of the City\u2019s neighborhoods, where each turn reveals a slice of San Francisco's unique soul. Today carries the promise of a serene, sunlit adventure in a city where the dramatic landscape meets the calm of everyday life.",
