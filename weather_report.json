For those venturing out, layering is advisable\u2014perhaps a light jacket accompanied by a cozy sweater, perfect for the shifting temperatures as one moves from the sunshine into the shade of towering buildings. The culinary scene beckons with the promise of warm coffee or fresh pastries enjoyed at a nearby caf\u00e9, while the streets await exploration; a leisurely stroll through the Mission District could reveal vibrant murals and inviting shops.
