    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a bright, sunlit sky, offering a pleasant respite from the often drizzly winter mornings. Presently, temperatures hover gently around the 59-degree mark, ushering in a mild afternoon that is both invigorating and comfortable. The air carries a crispness, lifted by soft north-northwest winds that ripple through the city, whispering promises of a cozy evening ahead. A slow descent in temperature will bring the evening glow down to approximately 47 degrees, inviting the onset of twilight.\n\nWhile the city basks in sunshine, one may notice hints of fog lingering delicately in the distance, a signature of San Francisco's enigmatic charm. The Golden Gate Bridge stands proud, framed against a backdrop of a brilliant blue sky, with wisps of the marine layer retreating back toward the bay. It is an ideal moment to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a shirt, perfectly suited for strolls through the vibrant streets or picturesque parks. As the sun begins to relinquish its hold on the day, a quiet walk along the waterfront or a visit to an intimate caf\u00e9 would be a fitting way to appreciate an afternoon that harmonizes tranquility and beauty.",
