    "weather_report": "Dusk slips into Bend beneath a patchwork of broken clouds, the last light dim and silvery, with the sun largely absent and the UV index essentially nil. The evening looks contemplative rather than bright; visibility is decent now but softened around the edges, and by late evening a light snow is expected to drift in, muting the streets and lending the night a quiet hush. It\u2019s a chilly, workable evening outdoors for a little while, turning more wintry and slick underfoot as the flakes arrive.\n\nDress in warm, layered comfort: a cozy midlayer under a weatherproof coat, hat and gloves, and boots with some grip if you\u2019ll be out after dark. This is a good hour for a short neighborhood walk before the snow starts, a last errand, then home for ordinary comforts\u2014stir a pot of soup, sort a shelf, write a postcard, or cue up a calm record. If you\u2019ll be driving later, leave early and take it slow; a light dusting can make familiar roads feel new.",
