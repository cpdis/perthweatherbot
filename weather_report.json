    "weather_report": "Northbridge wakes in the hush before dawn, the sky largely clear with only a few faint brushstrokes of cloud adrift. It feels calm and a bit cool, that quiet hour when the streets belong to cats and delivery vans, when breath hangs lightly and the first birds consider their opening notes.\n\nOnce the sun lifts, expect a bright, mostly sunny day with just enough passing cloud to give the light some texture. The air should feel clean and crisp, visibility good, shadows confident. UV is negligible now but will build steadily through late morning; a touch of sunscreen and sunglasses will serve you well if you\u2019re out around midday. Dress in simple layers: a light jacket to start, an easy shirt underneath for when the day warms its shoulders. It looks like a pleasant one for unhurried errands, watering the plants, a short walk with coffee in hand, or giving the car a rinse before lunch.",
