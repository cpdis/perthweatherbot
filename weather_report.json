    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds beneath a canvas of mostly sunny skies, a pleasant invitation for all. The iconic charm of the city is enriched by a gentle west wind that whispers through the streets, carrying the faintest hint of salt from the ocean. As the day brightens, the temperature dances around 62, gradually slipping toward a cooler embrace of 58. While the horizon boasts clarity and the Golden Gate stands proud, the coastal marine layer looms just beyond, hinting at the fog that might drift in later, softening the stark outlines of the bay.\n\nAs dusk approaches, anticipate a gradual shift to a cooler and mostly cloudy evening, descending to a tranquil low around 49. The night air will invite light layers; a soft sweater or a light jacket would serve well against the chill, contrasting the warmth of earlier hours. This enchanting weather is perfect for a leisurely stroll through the Mission District, where vibrant murals guide your path, or perhaps a cozy coffee shop visit in North Beach, relishing a warm drink while the city transitions to evening shadows. With the promise of an engaging sunset, the atmosphere is not merely pleasant; it teases the senses, suggesting the beauty of simple moments in a city rich with character.",
