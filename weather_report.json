    "weather_report": "Midday in Katy arrives under a steady quilt of overcast, the sun reduced to a pale idea behind the clouds. The light is gentle and uniform, the kind that softens edges and mutes the palette of streets and lawns; glare is gone, distance looks honest but subdued. Expect little in the way of true sunshine and a modest UV bite at most, even around lunch. It\u2019s a day that feels calm rather than bright, made for unhurried errands and clear thinking.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon is likely to remain gray with occasional brightening, a ceiling that keeps moods measured and plans sensible. Dress in light layers\u2014long sleeves or a soft sweater, with a jacket you can shrug off if the air steadies\u2014comfortable shoes, and perhaps a cap more for style than shade. Good hours for a lingering coffee, a quiet lap around the neighborhood, returning library books, or giving the workspace a small, satisfying re-order. If you\u2019re outdoors for a while, a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t go amiss, but the day invites steady movement more than basking.",
