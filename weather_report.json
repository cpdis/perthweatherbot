    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the sun currently glimmers with promise, casting a tranquil warmth that begins to permeate the chill of the early morning. It is a day blessedly clear, with visibility that allows one's gaze to wander freely across the glittering waters and dramatic hills. The forecast suggests a modest high around 57, slowly retreating to a cooler embrace of 55 by afternoon, complemented by gentle, yet spirited northeasterly winds that dance about at 8 to 18 mph, occasionally sweeping in with bursts of notable gusts. \n\nTonight, the serene sky will yield to a sharper coolness, drawing temperatures down to a crisp 42 several hours after dusk. As the mercury settles, those venturing out should embrace layers, for a light jacket will serve as a comforting companion against the increasing chill. Perhaps a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely coffee on a terrace would perfectly complement the clear skies and refreshing air. In this moment, with the city blanketing itself in tranquility, it beckons for simple pleasures, an invitation to savor the joys of the day and the stillness of the night to come.",
