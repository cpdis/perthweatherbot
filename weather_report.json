    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco arrives on a page of clear sky, the sun still clean and steady, throwing long, honeyed light across verandas and gum leaves. Visibility is sharp, the air untroubled by cloud, and the day has that open, generous feel that makes everything look newly washed. The UV has eased from its midday bite but can still nip exposed skin for a little while yet, settling toward low as the evening draws in. Expect the clarity to last through sunset and into a calm, star-leaning night.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant one: breathable fabrics and sunglasses now, with a light layer handy for after dusk. A gentle choice would be a slow walk to pick up groceries, watering the garden while the heat softens, or a quiet lap on the bike to a pocket park before the light fades. If home beckons, throw open a window, put the kettle on, and let the day exhale around you.",
