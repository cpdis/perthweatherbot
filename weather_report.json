    "weather_report": "In the tranquil town of Subiaco, the morning has gently ushered in with a chorus of scattered clouds overhead, a mosaic of gray and softness across an otherwise sleepy sky. The early morning mist has already given way to a hopeful light, hinting at a day that has shaken off its dreariness sooner than one might expect. The rain that whispered across the rooftops in the early hours has since subsided, leaving behind a fresh, cool air that still carries the earthy scent of wet soil. As you step outside, a light jacket and comfortable shoes would be the garb of choice, serving as your armor against the lingering, gentle chill. \n\nThe day promises a serene clarity, with clouds breaking apart like a theater curtain drawn back slowly, revealing patches of blue capable of captivating even the most hurried soul. Though the sun may play a shy part in today's performance, its presence will be enough to lend a hint of brightness \u2014 a reminder of warmer days that hang on the horizon. It is a day primed for strolling through tree-lined streets or taking a moment on a caf\u00e9 terrace, sipping something warm, absorbing the quiet beauty of an overcast but mild summer's day. There is charm in this cloud-filtered light, an invitation to search for reflections in puddles or to simply listen to the soft thrumming of the world waking up around you.",
