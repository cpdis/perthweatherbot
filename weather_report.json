    "weather_report": "The afternoon air in Downtown San Francisco is crisp and mainly clear, with a gentle embrace of sunlight illuminating the streets. As the sun arcs lazily towards the horizon, temperatures hover around a mild 55 degrees, tapering to around 52 later on. You might spot wisps of cloud curling above, hinting at the moisture to come. The wind, a soft whisper from the northeast, nudges through the neighborhoods, providing a refreshing touch against the chill that is characteristic of this time of year.\n\nAs evening draws near, anticipation builds for a rainy soir\u00e9e. The forecast speaks of rain arriving after 10 PM, painting the clouds in deeper shades of gray, promising a transition from the pleasant afternoon into a wet night. With a 90% chance of precipitation, it\u2019s wise to prepare for this shift\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a cozy sweater, accompanied by a sturdy umbrella, will keep you snug as the drops begin to fall. Given the conditions, you might consider a leisurely walk through a nearby caf\u00e9-lined street, savoring the warmth of a drink while the sky evolves. With the rain imminent, it\u2019s a perfect time to find refuge indoors, perhaps within the allure of a local bookstore, where the smell of paper mingles with the scent of warm pastries, setting the stage for a cozy evening ahead.",
