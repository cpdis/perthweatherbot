    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil aura envelops the city, with the faint echoes of the urban pulse dimming into shadows. The forecast whispers of a partly cloudy night, the temperature gently cradling around 46 degrees, and a soft northwest breeze teased by the night, weaving through the streets. The layered fabric of city life remains blurred under the subtle embrace of the evening chill, where glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge fade into a delicate obscurity, the horizon blurring, hinting at the presence of fog's lingering caress.\n\nCome Tuesday, the sun will emerge to cast its golden light across the city. A promise of mostly sunny skies hovers, though temperatures will trend down slightly, the midday warmth tapering to around 56 degrees. The day encourages a lightness about attire; a well-fitted coat and breathable layers will serve well, ensuring comfort while strolling along this beautiful urban landscape. In the softness of the sun's return, one might find joy in a leisurely walk through a nearby park, or perhaps the quiet contemplation of a corner caf\u00e9, the rich aroma of coffee complementing the gentle warmth of the sun. It\u2019s a day of simple pleasures, urging an embrace of the beauty within the familiar rhythms of the city.",
