    "weather_report": "After midnight in Katy, the evening\u2019s light rain has left the streets lacquered and quiet, and the sky is a washed slate with no hint of moon or star. The air feels gently cool and a little damp, with visibility softened at the edges. There\u2019s no sunshine to be had at this hour, and the UV index is essentially asleep; the mood is subdued, reflective, and good for unhurried breaths on a doorstep or a lamp-lit page indoors.\n\nGiven the recent pattern of light showers through the afternoon and early evening, expect a muted start to the day: clouds lingering, perhaps a passing sprinkle, and any sun arriving filtered and shy, keeping the UV low unless the ceiling thins later. Dress for the in-between\u2014breathable layers, a light rain jacket, shoes that don\u2019t mind a puddle. It\u2019s a day for quiet, ordinary tasks: a slow coffee before dawn, a short umbrella walk between showers, a tidy-up of the desk, a grocery run when the radar looks friendly. If you\u2019re driving early, leave a little extra time for slick patches and the occasional wavering mist.",
