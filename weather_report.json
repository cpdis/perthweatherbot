    "weather_report": "Bend eases into evening under a quilt of broken cloud, the sun already muted and the UV all but gone. The light feels silvery and restrained, edges softened, with patches of sky opening and closing as the overcast drifts. Expect the same pattern through tonight: a changeable canopy, no great drama, just a quietly mottled sky that lets a few stars blink through and then hides them again. It\u2019s not a crystalline night, but it is a steady one.\n\nDress in simple, cozy layers\u2014a warm jacket and a hat if you plan to linger\u2014something you won\u2019t mind keeping on during a slow errand or a short neighborhood loop. This is weather for ordinary comforts: returning a library book before closing, an unhurried grocery run, tending a pot on the stove while you sort tomorrow\u2019s list, or a brief porch sit to watch the clouds shuffle by. If you need a stretch, a gentle walk is enough; the air invites a measured pace rather than a charge.",
