    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries a gentle chill, inviting the city\u2019s night lights to twinkle in the darkening sky. With temperatures drifting towards the low forties, a knotted scarf and a warm jacket would offer the necessary comfort against the brisk evening breeze. The forecast hints at partial clouds, a soft veil dimming the stars, while the light northwest winds tease the edges of warmth lingering from the day\u2019s activities.\n\nLooking toward the day ahead, Sunday promises a welcoming embrace of sunshine, though temperatures will be modest, peaking near fifty-four before dipping slightly in the afternoon. The morning might emerge with a crisp clarity, where one could find solace in a quiet walk, perhaps along the waterfront, basking in the sun\u2019s gentle caress while savoring a warm brew from a nearby caf\u00e9. The marine layer\u2019s presence is unlikely to ghost the hills, as today\u2019s forecast suggests a clear horizon, making it a splendid time to explore the hidden paths of the city or simply enjoy a leisurely afternoon at a local park. The day holds delightful potential for those who choose to wander into its embrace, dressed thoughtfully against the coolness of the surrounding air.",
