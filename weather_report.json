    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a shroud of rain and cloud, a moisture-laden air reminding us of winter\u2019s quiet insistence. As the temperature gently climbs from the cool embrace of 52 to a mild 54, winds from the south-southeast cause the droplets to dance, urging the evening into a soft, rhythmic lullaby. Those venturing outside should don a warm, waterproof layer, perhaps paired with sturdy shoes to navigate puddles that will gather like tiny lakes on the sidewalks. The steadfast rain promises to provide between a half and three-quarters of an inch, nourishing the earth and ensuring that tomorrow's skies continue the narrative of this season.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Saturday, the symphony of raindrops will carry on, painting the day in shades of gray. The high temperature greets us near 59, with gusts traveling in from the south-southwest, reminding us of the unstoppable force of nature. Clarity wafts on the breeze, but expect the fog to linger, a veil over the iconic skyline. Activities, rather than forcing one into the chill, invite a warm cup of coffee savored beside a window, or perhaps a quiet afternoon engrossed in literature at a favorite caf\u00e9. These moments, despite their restraint, carry an intimate charm that makes them all the more precious.",
