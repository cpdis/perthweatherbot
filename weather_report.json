    "weather_report": "Perth at midday is washed in bright spring light; the air feels clear and the sun has a determined edge. A few scattered clouds are expected to wander through early afternoon before the sky opens to a cleaner blue toward evening, so the day will read sunny overall with good clarity and sharp shadows. UV is likely high through the afternoon, the kind that warms the shoulders before you notice; seek shade when you can, and keep sunscreen, sunglasses, and a brimmed hat close. Dress in breathable layers and comfortable shoes. Let the hours be modest and unhurried: hang a load on the line, take a quiet loop along the river or through a leafy street, fetch a couple of pantry staples on foot, or sit with a book in a pocket of dappled shade and let the breeze turn the pages. As the light softens later, an easy walk home will feel just right.",
