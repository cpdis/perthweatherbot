    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night whispers with the chill of the season, enveloped in a veil of clouds that obscure the skyline beneath a muted blanket of gray. As the early hours pass, a soft rise in temperature hints at the possibility of dampness, with faint traces of rain expected to caress the city before day\u2019s end. The brisk southeast winds carry the scent of the ocean and promise a dynamic atmosphere, marking the dawn of a day where rain finds its voice amidst the shadows of concrete and steel.\n\nBy midday, as the clouds thicken, one can anticipate their footsteps splashing in puddles while the city\u2019s heartbeat thrums on with quiet resilience. The chance of rain looms around 70%, with the afternoon light barely breaking through the blanket of gray, making indoor pursuits more inviting than traipsing through the drizzle. A cozy caf\u00e9, with warmth spilling from its doors, offers a haven against the chill, where one might savor a cup of rich coffee or tea as the world outside languishes under the weight of the clouds. For those who must venture forth, a light jacket and sturdy shoes would be a prudent choice, allowing for both comfort and functionality in the likely wet embrace of the city. It\u2019s a day that calls for reflection, perhaps inviting you to explore the gems found within, rather than the peaks of a fog-laden cityscape.",
