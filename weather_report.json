    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night wears a cloak of clouds, with temperatures hovering around a brisk 46 degrees, the air stirred by gentle breezes from the north-northeast. As dawn approaches, the city remains wrapped in a gray embrace, hinting at the possibility of rain that looms after 4 PM. The promise of a mostly sunny day breaks through the clouds, with a high nearing 59. Expect the warmth to dissipate into a cooler afternoon as the clouds take charge, ushering a 50% chance of rain that could bring a whisper of moisture, perhaps just a trace.\n\nThe first light of day will reveal the signature charm of the Bay Area, where fog often dances strategically around iconic landmarks. As the morning unfurls, one might find the marine layer extending its reach, adding a soft filter to the views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the intricate cityscape. It would be wise to don layers\u2014a light jacket or sweater will suffice, especially as temperatures fluctuate and the threat of a shower could surprise those unprepared. A stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping for a warm beverage in one of the snug cafes, would pair perfectly with today\u2019s transitional weather. Engaging in a leisurely exploration of the city\u2019s nooks and crannies feels fitting, as the day promises to shift from the cool embrace of the morning skies to more clarity, inviting the charm of San Francisco into the heart of all who wander.",
