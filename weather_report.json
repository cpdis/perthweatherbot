    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean, unblemished sky, the morning sun already bright enough to draw sharp edges on verandas and jacaranda trunks. The air feels clear and dry, with that hard blue that promises a day without much in the way of cloud. By late morning into the afternoon the sun will rule the scene; expect strong glare and a UV index that climbs quickly, better met with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and light breathable layers.\n\nIt looks like a day to do the outside things early and unhurried: a stroll for coffee, a quick loop through the neighborhood, watering the pots before they lean. As the light turns fierce, slip into shade for a book, a quiet chore, or a slow lunch, then consider stepping back out when the heat softens and the familiar sea breeze, if it comes, cools the edges. It\u2019s a simple, crystal-clear day\u2014pleasant in the margins, uncompromising at noon.",
