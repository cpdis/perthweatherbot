    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a clean, open sky and just a brush of cloud, the kind that drifts without urgency and lets the first stars come through. Any bite from the sun is long gone now; UV is negligible and won\u2019t trouble you again until after sunrise. The night looks clear to gently mottled, with a few more clouds wandering in later, but not enough to spoil the view or the mood. It feels like a pleasant night to keep things simple: a slow stroll after dinner, a sit on the balcony with a book, unhurried conversation at a quiet cafe. Dress lightly with a comfortable layer you can shrug on if you linger; a cardigan or light jacket will do. Expect the rest of the night to remain calm and partly clear rather than bright, more silver than gold.",
