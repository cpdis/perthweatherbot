    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Subiaco, the skies overhead remain only lightly flecked with clouds. In this quiet moment past eight in the evening, the waning light notes the presence of just a few clouds, hints that earlier, during the late afternoon, the sky welcomed scattered clouds like gentle brushstrokes across a sunlit canvas. The day has leaned towards clarity, with the sun's rays still warm in memory though now tempered by the cool embrace of the evening. The air still carries a hint of the day's vigor that, while no longer requiring the shade of a sunhat, calls for a comfortable sweater for a stroll beneath the star-flecked canopy. Given these conditions, a light dinner outdoors or a gentle walk sounds appealing, both offering moments to appreciate the day as it fades. The ambiance suggests a time perfect for shared conversations lingering over the transition from day to night or perhaps simply basking in the tranquility of the present, accompanied by subdued amber glows from street lamps beginning to flicker into their nightly duty, preserving the aura of a day well witnessed.",
