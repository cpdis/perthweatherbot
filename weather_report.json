    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a pale, honest sky, the kind that lets early birdsong carry. A few light clouds drift at dawn, more decoration than omen, and the air feels clean and open, the streets etched with clear edges as the light begins to gather.\n\nThrough the morning, expect a bright, mostly sunny day with only passing wisps overhead. It will feel pleasantly mild at first, warming as the sun takes charge; UV will climb quickly into the high range typical for late November, so lean on shade and sunscreen once the day is underway. Dress in light layers and breathable fabrics, and reach for a hat and sunglasses. It\u2019s a good morning to step out for a quiet coffee, water the garden before the glare hardens, tune a bicycle and take a brief spin along calm streets, or run a few errands while the light is still kind; later, let the afternoon do its shining while you read near a cool window.",
