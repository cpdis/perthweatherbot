    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Downtown San Francisco, the night sky remains draped in a thick tapestry of clouds, conveying a sense of quietude before the day unfolds. The temperature is mild, hovering around the low fifties, inviting a gentle wrap of a light sweater or a cozy jacket for those venturing out into the tranquil morning air. As the sun rises, the promise of a mostly sunny day becomes apparent, with temperatures expected to touch the low sixties before gently retreating to a cooler embrace by afternoon. A subtle northwest breeze will weave through the streets, contributing to a pleasant, invigorating atmosphere.\n\nDespite the forecast of brighter skies, a lingering marine layer is likely to keep the iconic coastal fog hovering at bay, perhaps curling around the tips of the Golden Gate and caressing the city\u2019s famous hills. It's a day for local explorations; perhaps a stroll through one of the city's vibrant neighborhoods or a leisurely visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 to savor the rich flavors of a fresh-brewed coffee. The clear patches of blue that begin to peek through the clouds promise a day that is more charming than typical San Francisco chill\u2014ideal for outdoor activities, whether it's wandering along the waterfront or simply enjoying the changing light as it dances upon the bay. Dressing in layers will serve you well, allowing for comfort as the temperatures transition throughout the day.",
