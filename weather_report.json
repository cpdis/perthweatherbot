    "weather_report": "Today, Downtown San Francisco basks in abundant sunlight, though a brisk wind stirs the cold air, reminding us of the season\u2019s chill. The temperature, reaching a comfortable high around the mid-fifties, may descend into the evening, with a few degrees slipping down when the sun bids farewell. A serenade of clouds plays on the edges of visibility, although they fail to obscure the iconic skyline that stretches towards the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead, the brightness seems to illuminate the air, casting soft shadows that frame the streets below.\n\nAs the day wanes, the freshness in the atmosphere adds a touch of crispness, enticing you to layer up in a cozy sweater or light jacket, especially if you plan to linger outdoors. With the wind at your back, consider a casual stroll along the Embarcadero, where the glittering bay mirrors the vibrant energy of the city, or perhaps a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, sipping a hot beverage as the evening unfolds. While fog may linger at the fringes\u2014a gentle reminder of the marine layer's presence\u2014today is painted in clear, sunny strokes, perfect for embracing the last light of a late autumn day.",
