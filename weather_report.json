    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives under a clean, insistent light, the sky an uncomplicated blue and the air clear enough to make every leaf and brick look freshly drawn. Shadows sit crisp and compact; there\u2019s a sense of calm brightness rather than glare, a day that invites you outside without fuss.\n\nThe forecast holds that clarity through the afternoon into early evening, with sunshine leading the show and only a modest breeze to keep it honest. UV will be punchy for this time of year, so favor a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and light breathable clothing; short sleeves for walking, a thin layer for when you pause in the shade or as the late light loses its warmth. It\u2019s a fine day for ordinary rituals: a stroll to fetch bread or flowers, airing the house, hanging laundry, a quiet circuit of the neighborhood, or a quick pedal to the shops before the sun tilts and the light turns amber. Expect simple, agreeable weather and views that stay sharp from now to dusk.",
