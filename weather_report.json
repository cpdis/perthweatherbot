    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with a soft, charcoal sky and a hush to the air. The sun is gone and with it any bite of UV, leaving the streets under low, pearly cloud that blurs the edges of things and halos the lamps. It feels gentle rather than bleak, the kind of evening where you hear your footsteps and the town breathes a little slower.\n\nLight rain is expected to slip in later tonight and wander through after midnight, more a patient tap on the awnings than a deluge. It won\u2019t be sunny or crisp, but it will be quietly beautiful in its own damp way. A light rain jacket, closed shoes, and a small umbrella will suit you fine. If you\u2019re out, an unhurried meal close to home or a quick errand before the showers arrive; if you\u2019re in, fold laundry, sort the week\u2019s notes, or read three unimportant pages that turn into ten. The night encourages small, domestic victories and an early tram if you must travel.",
