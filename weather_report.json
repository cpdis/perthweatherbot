    "weather_report": "Denmark settles under a washed-grey sky this afternoon, pavements dark and gleaming from the midday showers. Sunshine is scarce, at best a fleeting silver through cloud; the UV index stays low, slipping toward negligible as the light thins. The air feels clean and damp, edges of buildings softened by fine drizzle and low cloud, with visibility more muted than murky. Expect on-and-off light rain to loiter into the later hours before relaxing to a quiet, overcast evening.\n\nIt\u2019s a contemplative sort of day\u2014gentle rather than grim\u2014inviting patience and small comforts. Dress in easy layers with a light waterproof and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles; tuck a compact umbrella in your bag and a soft scarf at the collar. For the late afternoon, a slow errand nearby, a brief museum stop, or a caf\u00e9 window with a notebook suits the mood. Between showers, take a short neighborhood walk and let the damp leaves do their work on the senses; back home, oil a bicycle chain or put a simple soup on while the rain taps out a rhythm.",
