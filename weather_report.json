    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a delicate interplay of sun and clouds, suggesting that the day remains refreshingly brisk yet tinged with the possibility of a light shower. As the mercury climbs, expect a pleasant high around 60, though a gradual dip to about 56 whispers of the typical maritime influence. The west winds weave through the streets, carrying a gentle breeze, while the chance of rain flirts at 30%, hinting at only a drizzle to grace the pavement, most likely before dawn.\n\nAs daylight succumbs to twilight, the atmosphere will shift to a partly cloudy canvas, the temperature retreating to a cool 48. A similar wind dance continues, with gusts stirring enough to remind you of the Bay\u2019s unpredictable nature. It\u2019s likely you will find yourself enveloped in a serene blend of coastal air, accompanied by a chance of brief rain. Given these conditions, a well-layered outfit\u2014a comfortable sweater or jacket\u2014would suffice as you explore the city. Perhaps a casual stroll through one of the many charming neighborhoods, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to watch the world pass by, would be the perfect way to absorb the day's quiet complexity and anticipation for the evening ahead.",
