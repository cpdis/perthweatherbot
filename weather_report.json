    "weather_report": "In downtown San Francisco, today presents a moody tapestry of shifting weather\u2014a blend of fleeting sun and impending rain. As you step outside, the city greets you with a tentative warmth that contrasts the chill creeping in from the south. The high, hovering around fifty-nine, whispers of a brisk afternoon that will settle into a cooler embrace of fifty-one by nightfall. The clouds linger, ready to coalesce into rain later, particularly once the sun dips below the horizon, wrapping the streets in a cloak of gray. A chance of rain showers still dances lightly in the air, an invitation for umbrellas later in the day, while gusts of wind playfully tussle with the leaves, suggesting a restless atmosphere.\n\nWith signs of the marine layer still softly clinging to the edges of the Golden Gate, visibility isn\u2019t crystal clear, but the city\u2019s characteristic beauty still shines through the haze. It\u2019s a day to wear layers\u2014perhaps a warm sweater beneath a light jacket, ensuring comfort against the chill and sudden winds. As the clock ticks toward evening and the scent of rain becomes more pronounced, consider a stroll through nearby cafes, a perfect setting to sip on warm drinks while the city\u2019s lights start to twinkle against the encroaching clouds. Perhaps a gentle walk towards the waterfront, where the distant sound of waves mingled with the patter of raindrops offers a soothing rhythm to a day still steeped in the unique charm of San Francisco.",
