    "weather_report": "Adelaide wakes to a crisp, lucid morning, the kind that makes edges look sharper and colors a shade truer. Skies lean mostly clear now and are expected to stay bright through midday before a brush of scattered cloud wanders in during mid-afternoon. Sunshine will feel honest rather than fierce; the UV should rise to a moderate bite around lunch under the clear spell, then ease as the light softens later. Air clarity looks excellent, the sort of day where distant hills stand up straight and shadows have clean outlines, with no hint of rain.\n\nDress in easy layers\u2014a light jacket or knit over a tee\u2014add sunglasses, and keep a dab of sunscreen for the midday stroll. It\u2019s a pleasant day for unhurried errands on foot, a coffee outside in a patch of sun, or a quiet hour with a book on a park bench before the clouds drift in. If you\u2019re feeling domestic, wash on the line should dry steadily; if you\u2019re out, a gentle spin along the river paths or a meander through the Botanic Garden suits the mood of the sky.",
