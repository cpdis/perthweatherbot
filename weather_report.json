    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco opens clean and bright, a few polite clouds drifting without intent while the sun sharpens edges and brings the streets into focus. Expect the day to stay mostly sunny and clear through the late morning into early afternoon, the light vivid and a touch brassy as UV rises quickly to very high levels. It feels pleasantly warm rather than oppressive, the kind of day that invites you out but asks you to respect the midday glare.\n\nDress in light, breathable layers with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; keep water close and favor shade in the heart of the day. It\u2019s a good morning for unhurried errands on foot, a gentle spin to the shops, or hanging the washing so it dries in no time; later, claim a quiet corner under a tree with a book or a late coffee while the afternoon light softens.",
