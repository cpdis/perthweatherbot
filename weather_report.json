    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco arrives clear and uncomplicated, the sky rinsed to a clean blue that promises more light with every minute. The air feels gentle now, but the sun already has intent; by late morning through midafternoon the UV will climb quickly, so a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are wise companions. Visibility looks crystal, edges crisp and colors honest, with no cloud expected to wander in; it\u2019s the sort of spring day that sharpens the mood and invites unhurried errands on foot.\n\nExpect sunshine to rule through lunch and beyond, warm without the heavy hand of summer. Dress in light layers you can peel back: a breathable shirt, easy trousers or a skirt, and something light for the early shade. It\u2019s a fine day for ordinary pleasures\u2014walking to pick up a loaf, tending a few pots, hanging fresh laundry, or cycling the quiet back streets to a late-morning coffee. If you\u2019re staying out, favor a patch of dappled shade and keep water close; the day will reward those who move at its bright, steady pace.",
