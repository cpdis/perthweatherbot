    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean, unblemished sky, the kind of blue that makes everything seem freshly etched. Through the late morning and into early afternoon the sun will blaze without interruption, the air dry and clear, edges crisp, shadows inky and short. UV levels will run very high to extreme around midday; even in brief moments, the light has bite, so bring a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a generous layer of sunscreen. Light, breathable clothing will feel kindest, and a bottle of water within reach will seem like good company.\n\nIt\u2019s a day that invites simple, quiet errands on foot before lunch\u2014posting a letter, a slow browse in a bookshop on Rokeby Road, a coffee taken in the shade. By the hottest hours, let the sunshine be admired from indoors: catch up on reading by a bright window, sort a drawer, or phone a friend. As the light softens later, a gentle wander through Kings Park or a meander past calm terraces will be lovely, the sky still polished and the air carrying a hint of evening relief. Hang the washing and it will dry quickly; water the pots early or late, and let the day simply hum along.",
