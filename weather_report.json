    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco arrives with a hush and the soft patter of light rain moving in around sunrise, keeping the sky a gentle slate and the air a little cool and fragrant. Expect the morning to stay damp and mostly overcast, with only shy, filtered light slipping through at times; sunshine will be scarce early and the UV index low, edging only modestly higher if any brief breaks appear later. The day looks muted rather than wild, the kind of grey that softens edges and keeps the streets unrushed.\n\nA light waterproof layer and closed shoes will serve you well, with a compact umbrella for the intermittent showers; carry sunscreen only as a just-in-case for a brighter midday crack in the cloud. It\u2019s a good morning for small, practical comforts: an unhurried start at home, a tram-quiet commute with a book, or a short walk between showers to enjoy the clean, rain-washed scent of the neighborhood. Save anything sun-seeking for another day; this one asks for patience and a steady pace.",
