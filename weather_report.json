    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere hangs heavy with a gentle chill, a prelude to the night. The skies are mostly cloaked in clouds, casting a muted gray over the city\u2019s iconic skyline, while the winds whisper softly from the north-northeast at around seven miles an hour. With a low around 46, a light jacket or a cozy sweater would be wise, inviting a sense of comfort against the evening crispness.\n\nTomorrow promises a shift as the sun attempts to break through the clouds, teasing a glimpse of brightness before the possibility of rain looms after 4 PM. The day begins with the potential for some pleasant moments; expect temperatures to flirt with the upper 50s. The air might feel a bit damp, hinting at the anticipated showers, and the chance of precipitation rests delicately at 50%. One can envision a leisurely stroll through the streets, pausing at a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, perhaps indulging in a leisurely afternoon spent at the conservatory or along the waterfront, before the skies weave in their rainy threads. With potential for fog and a marine layer creeping in, it\u2019s prudent to prepare for the shifting moods of the day, cloaking your outfit in layers to embrace both the warmth and the cooling touch of the impending moisture.",
