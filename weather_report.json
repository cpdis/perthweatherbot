The horizon gleams under a veil of blue, suggesting a mostly sunny morning; yet hints of the famous marine layer linger, casting shadows across the skyline and hinting at the cool embrace of autumn. For those venturing out, the brisk air carries whispers of the slight drizzle that may dance upon the city this night, bringing with it a promise of softness that lingers in the cool breeze.\n\nDressed in layers will serve you well against the numbing bite of the air\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket paired with comfortable trousers; the gentle south southwest winds, ranging from a whisper to a sigh, make a scarf a worthy companion. With the afternoon\u2019s temperature settling around a mild fifty-nine degrees, outdoor cafes could invite you to sip a hot coffee while indulging in the sights and sounds of the busy streets, or rediscovering a favorite park for a quiet moment among the rustling leaves. Engage in the simple pleasure of strolling along the waterfront, reveling in the clarity yet to be broken by the evening's embrace of cloudier skies.",
