    "weather_report": "As the clock gently sails past two in the morning in Subiaco, the sky remains clear, a curtain of darkness sprinkled with celestial pinpricks. The whispering wind carries echoes of the night, mellow and soft, adding an air of tranquility to this early hour. Soon, a hint of clouds will gather, but they promise to hold back, allowing the sun\u2014the timeless stage actor\u2014to illuminate the day with its golden presence. With the dawn, the promise of gentle sunshine teases, offering a perfect balance for a felicitous April morning. Today may unfold with amiable warmth, a companion that invites one to step into its embrace with a light jacket or a cardigan.\n\nAs the sun climbs higher, driven by time's unyielding hand, the UV index may rise, though whispered shadows and a feigned veil of clouds will dance intermittently across the azure canvas, tempering the sun's more fiery inclinations. It's a day made for the simple joys, like an unhurried stroll along paths lined with waking trees or tending to a garden all coy with spring's fervor. Perhaps, as afternoon tips its hat to evening, pause and savor a book on a sun-dappled porch, with nothing but the melody of distant birds and soft breezes to accompany the flipping of pages. \n\nLet today's weather be a gentle guide, an invitation to leisurely indulgence in the subtle pleasures of life, the kind that's oft too rare in the haste of living.",
