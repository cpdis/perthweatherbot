    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Subiaco, the day greets you with a gentle drapery of heavy clouds blanketing the early July sky. The air, not laden with the weight of rain but filtered through the soft brume of overcast, offers a calm yet muted beginning. It's not a day for sunbathing or donning your sunhat, but the clouds create an artist\u2019s palette of diffused gray that speaks of a tranquil, moderate day. As the warmth slowly seeps into the earth, it seems like a gentle reminder to gear up for a day that promises neither the brilliance of sunlight nor the gloom of rain.\n\nWith the gentle blanket of clouds above, it might seem as if the heavens are whispering for you to take things a notch quieter, finding solace in reflective pursuits. Palette blues and ash greys call for muted tones in your attire\u2014perhaps a cozy jumper, just to embrace the casual chill. Although missing the luminous spark of sunshine, optimism seeps through this gentle cloud cover. Embrace this serene morning perhaps with a stroll to a nearby caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a freshly brewed cup aligns perfectly with the enveloping sky, or find peace in leisurely reading by a window, where the soft light falls perfectly into place. It's a day of quiet beauty, made for subtle adventures and introspection.",
