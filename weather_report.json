The sky is adorned with a gentle backdrop of grayish clouds, with fog lingering closely to the hills in the distance, suggesting the marine layer is still at play. As the hours progress, the day's forecast carries a promise of intermittent rain showers\u2014a playful tease from the clouds that may keep one reaching for an umbrella while the sun attempts its sporadic appearances.\n\nWith temperatures lingering around a cool 55 degrees this afternoon, one might choose to dress in layers, perhaps donning a light jacket to guard against the brisk breeze that the south wind carries. The expected evening rain morphs the atmosphere, intensifying the city's mood. As golden hour approaches, consider taking a stroll through the quieter streets\u2014perhaps a warm cup of coffee in hand, followed by a visit to a local gallery or a cozy bookstore to shelter from the impending spritz. Alternatively, a leisurely sit by the window of a favorite caf\u00e9, watching the world go by as rain taps softly against the glass, may bring its own kind of warmth to the day.",
