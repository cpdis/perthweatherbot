    "weather_report": "Night has folded over Subiaco and the sky has the soft, pewter look that swallows stars; the air carries that quiet promise of rain. It won\u2019t be sunny now, of course, and the UV is essentially absent. Streetlights bloom in small halos, and the evening feels gentle and a bit introspective, the sort of calm that makes conversations softer and footsteps slower.\n\nLight rain is expected to wander in later tonight and linger into the small hours, more a courteous tap on windows than a downpour. Clarity will be muted, edges smudged by damp air. Dress for a cool, drizzly night: a light rain jacket or compact umbrella, shoes with some grip, maybe a thin layer to ward off the chill. It\u2019s a good evening for modest plans\u2014an unhurried walk under shopfront awnings, a simple dinner nearby, a book opened on the couch while the kettle murmurs. Cyclists might slow their corners; drivers, keep the wipers honest. The sun and its bite can wait until morning.",
