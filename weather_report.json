    "weather_report": "Late afternoon finds Denmark rinsed and reflective, the bright clarity of late morning having slid into a gentle, passing rain after midday. Pavements are dark and a little musical under tires, clouds layered in soft greys that mute the horizon. Any sunshine left today will be brief and slanting, more glimmer than blaze; the UV is low now, almost an afterthought in October\u2019s light. The day has felt honest rather than harsh\u2014clear to start, then quietly watered\u2014good visibility softened by showers rather than smudged.\n\nExpect the sprinkle to linger in pockets before easing toward evening, leaving the air cool and faintly metallic. A light waterproof jacket over a sweater is the right companion, with shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles and a small umbrella you can close one-handed. This is weather for ordinary comforts: a slow supermarket run, a tram ride with a book, a short walk between showers to breathe the damp leaves, a museum hour before closing, or simmering something simple once home. If you\u2019re out on a bike, fenders and patience.",
