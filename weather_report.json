    "weather_report": "Bend wakes under a clear, hushed sky, the kind that turns the edges of roofs silver and makes the air feel clean enough to ring. The morning will brighten quickly into a crisp, blue day with excellent clarity; distant ridgelines should stand out like cut paper. Sunshine looks abundant, gentle at first and then assertive by late morning. The UV index will be low early and only modest around midday, but at this elevation the light can feel sharper than you expect.\n\nIt\u2019s a layers day: a warm jacket, hat, and gloves for the first couple of hours, then something you can unzip when the sun begins to lean in. Sunglasses are wise, and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger outside around lunch. The mood suits quiet errands on foot, a short loop along the river trail, or a bike roll if the pavement is dry. Open the blinds, let the pale gold spill across the floor, and carry a warm mug on a slow walk to the corner\u2014nothing urgent, just the pleasant business of a clear winter morning.",
