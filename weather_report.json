    "weather_report": "Midday in Busselton arrives under broken cloud, the light slipping in and out like a lighthouse beam, warm and bright when it lands, softer and pearly when the cloud takes over. The air feels clean and a touch salty, the horizon clear, with no pressing hint of rain. Sunshine is still assertive and the UV bite is strong at this hour, even with the patchwork sky.\n\nThrough the afternoon, expect that dance to continue: sunny intervals, then a veil of cloud, then sun again, with a modest coastal breeze to keep things from feeling heavy. It\u2019s pleasant if you give the sun a little respect\u2014think breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen now; a light overshirt for later when the edge comes off the day. This is weather for simple, unhurried errands, a late lunch in the shade, or a quiet circuit on foot or bike once the glare eases; water the garden toward evening, or browse the shops and library while the clouds idle overhead. The day won\u2019t be crystal-blue, but it will be clear enough to feel open and kind.",
