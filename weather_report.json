    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning air is brisk and refreshing, while the overwhelming calmness of a mostly clear night stretches into daylight. The city appears to wake gently under a canopy of clarity, with temperatures hovering coolly. A light wind whispers from the north-northeast, as if urging the day to unfold. As the sun rises, it casts a soft golden hue\u2014promising warmth that increases throughout the day but inevitably dips back into the cool embrace of afternoon shadows. \n\nThough the high will flirt with the low sixties, the charm of the day lies not only in the pleasant sunlight but also in the absence of fog and a distinct lack of the marine layer that so often veils the coastal beauty. There's a vibrant clarity as the Golden Gate Bridge can be glimpsed in the distance\u2014no more obscured by the familiar shroud of mist. Ideal attire would be layers\u2014a light sweater over a tee, with perhaps a jacket at hand for the cooler moments, especially as evening approaches. The clear skies beckon one to enjoy a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, seize a caf\u00e9 terrace for a warm coffee, or wander through one of the meticulously curated parks, allowing the fresh air to refresh one's spirit.",
