    "weather_report": "The air in Downtown San Francisco tonight is tranquil, with a bit of a briskness accompanying the clear skies. As the sun dips beneath the horizon, the temperature settles around a mild 55 degrees, inviting a gentle stretching of limbs and perhaps a light jacket as the north wind whispers through the streets at 9 to 17 mph, occasionally gusting with a spirited edge. Tomorrow promises a sun-drenched day as golden rays blanket the city, with temperatures reaching a pleasant high near 68. A slight drop in the afternoon will yet maintain a comfortable warmth, while the wind will play its part lightly, offering a cooling touch as it dances through the San Francisco skyline.\n\nWith nightfall bringing a clearness that reveals the twinkling of city lights, the anticipated fog remains at bay, ensuring clarity of sight towards the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and beyond. The marine layer appears to have retreated, presenting a pristine canvas for a day of exploration. One might consider an evening stroll along the Embarcadero, enjoying the charm of the waterfront, or a quiet gathering over warmth and conversation at a local caf\u00e9, soaking in the peaceful ambiance. Anticipate a knit sweater or a light jacket for the night, and consider lighter layers for the morrow\u2019s sun, ideal for savoring a cup of coffee outdoors, or indulging in a leisurely walk through one of the city\u2019s lush parks.",
