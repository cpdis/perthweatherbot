    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the city basks under a canopy of mostly sunny skies, the cold, sharp air carrying a hint of the Pacific\u2019s brine. You can feel the chill tugging at the edges of your clothing, a reminder of the city\u2019s unpredictable weather. The highs will dance around 54 degrees, dipping gently towards 52 as the day progresses, nudged along by a gentle northwest breeze\u2014barely discernible yet ever-present. The horizon is crisp, unmarred by fog, allowing for clear views of the iconic landmarks that punctuate the seascape.\n\nTonight promises a more muted ambiance, with clouds diffusing the light and bringing a hush to the bustling streets as temperatures retreat to a comfortable 46. Dressing in layers remains essential; a light sweater or jacket will be your companion as the temperature cools and the breeze whispers through the avenues. This afternoon, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet visit to the nearby parks, where the tranquility of the moment can be savored, free from the clamor of holiday revelries. A cup of warm tea or coffee in hand can turn your outing into a cozy experience, embracing the understated beauty of a winter afternoon in San Francisco.",
