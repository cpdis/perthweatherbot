    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, an invigorating chill fills the air, hinting at the day to come. Currently, the skies are mostly clear, illuminated by starlight, but there lingers a promise of warmth as the sun rises, preparing to light up the cityscape. But for now, the cool north wind whispers through the streets, carrying a brisk vitality that cuts through the stillness of early morning. Temperatures will linger near the mild 47 degrees, perfect fodder for a light jacket or a cozy scarf, ensuring warmth against the sharp breeze. \n\nAs the day unfolds, expect an inviting sunshine to shower the city in golden hues, particularly as you stroll through the vibrant neighborhoods and quiet parks. The forecast predicts a high near 62, gradually settling to a comfortable 58 in the afternoon, a perfect excuse to venture out for a mid-day escape. The winds will dance briskly, gusting up to 38 mph, but this merely enhances the invigorating atmosphere. Feels of warmth will emerge throughout the day, as the marine layer retreats, revealing the clarity of the day ahead. Such weather beckons a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a quiet moment at one of the city's charming caf\u00e9s, where one might enjoy a warm latte while gazing out at the glistening bay. Consider layering, perhaps donning a light sweater over your outfit, for as the sun dips, its delightful glow will also take the warmth with it.",
