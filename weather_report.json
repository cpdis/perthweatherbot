    "weather_report": "As the day drifts into night, Downtown San Francisco dons a tranquil cloak of clarity. With the gentle embrace of a low 42 degrees, the air is crisp, tinged with a whisper of freshness that feels invigorating against the skin. A light south breeze, barely perceptible, rustles through the streets, casting a serene ambiance that invites evening strolls along Embarcadero. The city's skyline stands illuminated, and while daytime may unveil a gentle sun painting the horizons, now darkness deepens its allure, leaving a canvas of twinkling city lights and shadowed vistas.\n\nTomorrow promises a refreshing embrace of sunshine, peeking through at a high near 56 before softening into the afternoon around 53. With a light east-northeast breeze, the day encourages light layers \u2014 perhaps a comfortable sweater over a shirt, perfect for the playful dance between cool and warm winds. As the sun graces the city, the clarity is likely to unveil no hint of fog, making it an opportune moment to explore the golden landscapes of the city, whether that be meandering through the Botanical Garden or savoring a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9, watching the vibrant daily life unfold beneath the promise of a clear sky.",
