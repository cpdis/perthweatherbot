    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a hush and the smell of wet pavement waiting in the wings. Sunshine is spent for the day and the UV index has slipped to nothing; what light remains comes from doorways and streetlamps, which blur a little in the damp air. Light rain is expected to arrive late tonight and linger into the small hours, the kind that softens edges rather than shouts, leaving the town muted and reflective. It\u2019s a gentle, if slightly sodden, night\u2014more silver than gold, more echo than gleam.\n\nIf you\u2019re stepping out, a light waterproof and closed shoes will serve you, with an umbrella for the slow showers. It\u2019s a good evening for modest comforts: a short errand run before the rain thickens, a quiet trampling of familiar streets, or an unhurried hour at home tidying the week into shape, steeping tea, and setting out tomorrow\u2019s essentials. The night invites low-key plans and a calm pace, and the weather agrees\u2014nothing harsh, just a soft, persistent patter.",
