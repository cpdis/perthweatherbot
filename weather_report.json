    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, a tranquil veil encompasses Downtown San Francisco, where the cool air whispers tales of an emerging day. The sky remains partly cloudy, cradling a low that hovers around 47 degrees. As dawn breaks, a transformation is set to unfold: the sun will rise graciously over the horizon, painting the city in soft hues while promising a high near 58. This gentle warmth will wane a touch by afternoon, settling into the embrace of a 56-degree chill as a delicate north-northwest breeze stirs the air.\n\nDespite the promise of a mostly sunny Sunday, the city lies in a dynamic dance with its ever-present marine layer. Fog may cling stubbornly to the coast, draping the Golden Gate Bridge in an ethereal shroud, while the heart of the city breathes a mix of clarity with the shadows of distant clouds. As one contemplates the day ahead, layered clothing feels most sensible; a light jacket or sweater paired with comfortable trousers will ensure warmth without suffocating the freedom of movement. The invigorating atmosphere beckons for quiet strolls through the parks, perhaps followed by a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit, where one might enjoy the delight of sipped coffee while soaking in the softened sunlight filtering through the trees. Such mundane pleasures are enhanced by the serene backdrop of a San Francisco morning, a city poised on the edge of a new narrative unfurling before it.",
