    "weather_report": "Just before sunrise in Subiaco, the streets wear a soft sheen and the sky is a quiet pewter, with light rain settling in around dawn and lingering into the morning. Sunshine will be scarce early; the UV stays low at this hour and only nudges upward if the cloud breaks later, which looks uncertain. The air feels clean but the view is muted, edges blurred by drizzle on windows and a fine gloss on the road.\n\nDress for damp comfort: a light waterproof or trench over easy layers, closed shoes with a bit of grip, and a small umbrella you won\u2019t mind carrying. Sunscreen can wait unless patches of blue appear. It\u2019s a morning for modest plans and gentle timing\u2014an unhurried coffee, a quiet library stop, an early gym session, or short errand loops between showers. As the day unfolds, expect a subdued clarity rather than sparkle; pleasant enough if you lean into the calm and keep to covered walkways.",
