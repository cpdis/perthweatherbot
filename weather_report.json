Currently, the temperature hovers around 49 degrees, with a gentle north-northeast wind whispering through the streets at approximately 7 mph, guiding the night towards its mild conclusion. As dawn approaches, a soft rise to about 51 can be expected, heralding a pleasant Sunday ahead. \n\nBy daybreak, the sun will shine forth, illuminating the cityscape with a bright, cheerful promise. The forecast anticipates a high reaching near 62 degrees, though the afternoon will find temperatures settling closer to 58. While the morning may display a fleeting hint of marine layer, expect the cloud cover to dissipate, granting way to a mostly sunny outlook. For those venturing outdoors, it would be wise to dress in layers, prepared for the cool morning chill yet comfortable as the day warms. This is a day perfect for leisurely strolls through the park, perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink, or a simple gathering with friends as the city basks in its delicate clarity.",
