    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfurls with an all-encompassing gray, the kind that melds the city into one continuous, misty expanse. Rain drizzles down gently before transitioning to more persistent showers, as dark clouds roll in with a brisk southwest wind that delivers a distinct chill. By early afternoon, the city is likely to become alive with the rumble of distant thunder and flickers of lightning, weaving a dramatic tapestry against the backdrop of a city already accustomed to the whims of nature. On the streets, the air is thick, promising ample rainfall that may amount to a couple of inches, leaving puddles to reflect the somber sky.\n\nAs evening approaches, the storms will slowly relent, yielding to a fleeting, mostly clear night. The temperature drops, inviting layers as the cool air prevails. Those venturing out would do well to opt for a sturdy umbrella and a warm jacket, perhaps venturing into cozy cafes or bookstores to escape the dampness\u2014perfect for a warm drink and a good read. The allure of a quiet stroll along the waterfront might call out, but only to those who relish the cool embrace of a rainy evening. It is an invitation to witness the city bathed in the glow of streetlights, as soft reflections dance on rain-soaked pavement, best savored in the gentle rhythm of the rain.",
