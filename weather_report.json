    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air is tinged with a refreshing coolness, hinting at the night to come. Currently, the city basks under a partial veil of clouds, creating a canvas where the fading light blends subtly with the chill that will bring the temperature down to a crisp 46 degrees. The gentle breeze from the west-southwest adds a touch of movement, lightly rustling the lingering leaves, and carrying hints of the ocean. Visibility into the Bay remains remarkably clear for this time of year, with the distinctive outline of the Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against the receding sun.\n\nLooking forward to Friday, the dawn promises a modest warmth with highs around the mid-50s, yet by afternoon, temperatures will dip again, echoing the day's transition. While graced with intervals of sunshine, the presence of a light marine layer may spark a slight haze, but it is far from the thick fog usually associated with our foggy counterparts. Attire should reflect this blend of chill and warmth: a light jacket paired with comfortable layers would allow for versatility throughout the day. Embrace the outdoors\u2014this weather invites serene walks along the waterfront or a quiet moment enjoying your favorite book in one of the city's parks. As the evening unfolds, savor the night with a stroll under the glowing city lights, perhaps pausing to appreciate the gentle hush that settles over the bustling streets.",
