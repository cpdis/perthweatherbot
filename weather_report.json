    "weather_report": "Before sunrise in Subiaco, the streets are hushed and cool, the sky readying a clean, clear dawn. Forecasts point to a bright morning: mostly blue to begin, then a scatter of friendly clouds drifting in after breakfast. Light will be generous and sharp, the kind that polishes edges; UV is gentle now but will surge quickly once the sun climbs, so plan for shade and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out for long. The air looks clear, visibility crisp, the day leaning pleasant\u2014cool at first, then easy and warm with the sun, more sparkle than scorch.\n\nDress in light layers you can shed, breathable fabric, sunglasses, and a brimmed hat. This is a good morning for a quiet walk to fetch bread, a lap around the block with coffee in hand, or a small errand by bike before the pavements brighten; later, let the light in but keep it filtered, and take a seat by a window to read or tend to a to\u2011do list that doesn\u2019t require haste.",
