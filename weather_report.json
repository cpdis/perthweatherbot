    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts through the late afternoon under a flawless sky, the light still bright enough to sharpen edges on roofs and jacarandas. The sun has some sting to it even now, with UV running high until it slips toward the horizon, then softening into a gentle, crystal-clear evening. No clouds of consequence, just clean blue and the promise of a pale gold dusk.\n\nDress for simple comfort: airy layers, sunglasses, a hat, and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019re out before sunset; later, a light top for the cooler edge that follows nightfall. It\u2019s a pleasant, uncomplicated sort of weather\u2014good for a slow walk to the shops, hanging fresh laundry to drink in the dry light, tending pots on the balcony, or carrying a book to a quiet bench as the day fades. Supper outdoors would suit, nothing grand\u2014just the company of that empty, luminous sky.",
