    "weather_report": "As night cloaks Downtown San Francisco, a gentle rain begins to patter against the streets, wrapping the city in a shroud of dampness. The clouds hang heavily, their inky gray mass making the world feel smaller, more intimate. With temperatures settling around a cool 51 degrees, the air carries a hint of crispness that whispers promises of a wet morning ahead. The breeze meanders in from the southwest, playful yet resolute, hinting at the gusty clutches that may nudge those wandering about.\n\nTomorrow beckons with a likely continuation of rain, a more persistent presence in the skies as they remain mostly cloudy. The temperature will slip slightly, giving way to a high around 58, enveloping the day in a muted palette. The chance of precipitation remains strong, a steady 70%, potentially offering a soothing rhythm for those listening intently to nature's lullaby. It\u2019s an invitation to don a well-loved raincoat and sturdy shoes, as the wetness may dampen not only the ground but also one's spirits if caught unprepared. \n\nMuch of San Francisco will be enveloped in a light fog, with hints of the marine layer just brushing the edges, softening the city's famed silhouettes. This creates an aura of quiet reflection, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of coffee intertwines with the sound of distant laughter. As the evening settles, one might find creativity blossoming in such cozy corners, curled up with a book or experimenting with thoughts for the week ahead.",
