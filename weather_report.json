    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the sun graces the city this afternoon, casting warm golden rays that dance across the rooftops and pierce through the still brisk air. Peering towards the Golden Gate Bridge and further northeast to the skyline, a clear blue sky stretches infinitely, devoid of the usual fog that often drapes the bay in a blanket of mist. The temperature hovers pleasantly, encouraging those wandering the streets to embrace light layers that can easily be shed as the sun sinks lower, giving way to a cooler evening.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the warmth will gently retreat, ushering in a crisp night with a soothing breeze. Those seeking evening endeavors might find joy in an unhurried stroll along the Embarcadero, where the lights of the city twinkle like stars against the darkening sky, or perhaps they might settle into a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink. It's a perfect day to revel in the outward simplicity of the city\u2019s charm, where nature\u2019s clarity finds harmony with urban vibrancy.",
