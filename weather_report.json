    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, an inviting clarity envelops the city as sunlight blankets the skyline, casting a warm glow on its iconic structures. The afternoon, set to reach a high of 62 degrees, welcomes a gentle northwest breeze. The air feels crisp yet vibrant, with temperatures slightly dipping to around 60 as the hours pass. The absence of fog renders the Golden Gate Bridge and the expanse of the Bay visible, their majesty accentuated against the sparkling waters, an open invitation for leisurely strolls along the waterfront.\n\nAs night approaches, expect a tranquil transition to mostly clear skies, the coolness wrapping around the city like a familiar shawl, settling to a low of approximately 48 degrees. A light east-northeast wind whispers through the evening. Dressing in layers is wise; a light sweater paired with comfortable pants will serve well as the sunlight shifts and the air cools. Evenings like this are perfect for a quiet walk along the Presidio, savoring the serenity that descends upon the city, or perhaps finding a spot to enjoy a warm cup of coffee, reflecting on the beautiful day nearly slipped away.",
