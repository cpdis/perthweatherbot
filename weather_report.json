    "weather_report": "Perth Airport sits under a low, unbroken ceiling just past midnight, runway lights haloed and the air damp with promise. Drizzle is due to wander in toward the small hours, gathering into steadier rain by dawn, so expect a muted, silver morning with softened edges and quiet roads. Sunshine will be scarce; if the lid on the sky cracks at all later, it will be brief, and the UV stays low, lifting only a touch if a shy patch of blue appears. The day reads as grey and serviceable rather than wild, more a steady metronome of showers than any theatrics.\n\nDress for a lingering wetness: a light waterproof with a hood, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and a comfortable layer beneath. If you\u2019re up now, it\u2019s a night for unhurried tasks and an easy cup before bed; later, plan indoor errands, a quiet browse in a bookshop, or a slow coffee while the tarmac glistens. If traveling, allow a bit of time for slick roads and carry something to keep the seat dry; if staying put, let the rain set the tempo and work through the small, practical things.",
