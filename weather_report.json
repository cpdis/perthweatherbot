    "weather_report": "As dusk descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air remains cool and slightly brisk, with a gentle northwest breeze whispering through the streets. Tonight, the clouds linger overhead, casting a soft, muted light that envelops the city in a cozy embrace. With temperatures dipping to around the low fifties, a light jacket or a sweater will serve well to fend off the chill as the evening unfolds. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the promise of sunshine brings an uplifting cast to the already dynamic landscape. Early glimpses of sunlight may tease through the clouds, increasing the temperature to a comfortable high near sixty-one before tipping gently to a cooler fifty-seven in the afternoon. Though a lingering marine layer may play hide and seek, the clarity of the day will lend itself to exploring the charming corners of the city, perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth of coffee can be savored alongside the emerging light. Embrace the subtle beauty of this coastal city, as it gracefully balances serenity and energy in equal measure.",
