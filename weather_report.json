    "weather_report": "Dallas drifted through a sun-forward day: a few morning tufts gave way to a clean, open noon sky, bright enough that sunglasses earned their keep and the midday UV, while winter-softened, was still noticeable; by evening it has fallen to almost nothing. Now the night is clear and steady, the air crisp, the skyline sharp as cut paper. The overall mood is pleasantly calm, leaning mild to cool after dark. Dress is simple: light layers would have suited the day, and a sweater or jacket makes sense now. Given the hour, consider a quiet neighborhood walk, a leisurely errand without glare, or a brief driveway stargaze before heading in; if you\u2019re staying home, crack a window for a moment and let a ribbon of clean night air through the room.",
