    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush, the sky a deepening blue with just a few thin clouds drifting like thoughts you mean to remember. It feels cool and clean before sunrise, the kind of air that clears the head and sharpens the view down quiet streets. UV is negligible at this early hour, and the day looks set to be clear and bright once the sun is up, with only light, decorative cloud to soften the glare.\n\nExpect a mainly sunny day with good clarity and a friendly mood to the light; it should feel pleasantly crisp at first, warming steadily. Dress in easy layers: a light sweater or jacket now, then short sleeves, sunglasses and a hat by mid-morning as the UV climbs from low to decidedly lively. A dab of sunscreen will earn its keep. It\u2019s a good morning for unhurried errands on foot, watering the garden before the heat finds it, or a gentle ride to pick up bread and fruit. Later, open the windows for a slow draft of fresh air, take your coffee outside, and let the sun do the drying on a line\u2014simple tasks that suit a clear, well-behaved day.",
