    "weather_report": "Clouds have swept across the Subiaco sky, playing a gentle game of hide-and-seek with the winter sun. The morning began shrouded and somewhat pensive with a comforting blanket of broken clouds caressing the sky. As we moved towards mid-morning, the heavier clouds began to disperse, giving way to more widely scattered formations, softening the sun's rays into a muted, but ever hopeful, brilliance. \n\nAt this moment, the weather holds a unique dichotomy, offering both the contemplative tranquillity of an overcast day and the buoyant optimism of emerging sunlight. Suitable attire for the day teeters on layers, perhaps a warm sweater that could be easily shrugged off should the sun emerge victorious from its cotton-wool captors. The day may best be spent in calm serenity, perhaps with a steamy cup of cocoa, a good book by the window, or a tranquil walk in the park during a soothingly overcast window of opportunity, embracing the silver linings of scattered clouds.",
