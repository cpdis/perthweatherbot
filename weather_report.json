    "weather_report": "As the sun stretches over the horizons of Scarborough on this April morning, a gentle veil of clouds dances across the sky, letting sporadic rays of light filter through with an ethereal softness. By 8:40 in the morning, a quiet tranquility still lingers; the scattered clouds promise moments of bright clarity interspersed with the soothing shade of cloud cover. It's a day sculpted for those who relish serenity and mildness, where the sun teases but does not overwhelm, and the UV index remains modest enough to forego the insistent need for sunscreen. This is an inviting backdrop for leisurely pursuits that call for contemplation or gentle mobility. Dress in light layers, ready to shed or add as the sun plays its hide and seek. A stroll along the picturesque seafront could brightens one's spirit, or perhaps, a comfortable nook in a caf\u00e9 with a book for company will lead to hours of tranquil indulgence. The weather whispers of harmony and gentle contentment; it speaks to the soul eager for a day that unfolds at a pace unfettered by haste or clamor.",
