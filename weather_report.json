    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds blankets the landscape, with the likely arrival of light drizzle whispering through the early morning hours. As the evening deepens, the cool air settles around 49 degrees, a reminder of the ever-present maritime embrace of this city. The winds murmur softly from the south, offering a mild breath against the skin. \n\nAs dawn approaches, tomorrow beckons with a delicate promise of rain\u2014a fleeting chance before ten, replaced by the thrum of raindrops tapping against windows and rooftops. By midday, the sun may peek through, spilling fragments of warmth amidst the gray, while temperatures hover around a fitting 61 degrees, then recede to a brisk 57 in the afternoon. Dress in layers, embracing the cool, damp air; a light jacket accompanied by a scarf will shield you from the chill, while sturdy shoes will serve well against puddles that are destined to form. These conditions set a tone perfect for a quiet stroll beneath a canopy of falling leaves, perhaps visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 with rich brews that smooth the edges of any drizzle that persists.",
