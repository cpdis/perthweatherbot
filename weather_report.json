    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a solid blanket of rain and clouds, casting a muted gray over the cityscape. As the day progresses, temperatures are expected to dip slightly, settling around 54 degrees, accompanied by a steady south-southeast breeze whispering through the empty streets. The promise of rain is palpable, with a 100% chance of precipitation hovering above, inviting droplets to mingle with the cool air. The rainfall could measure between a quarter to half an inch\u2014gentle, yet persistent.\n\nLater tonight, a chance of rain lingers but diminishes as the hours roll on, with clouds giving way to a mostly cloudy night. The temperature will gently rise, landing around 51 as the cool of the evening arrives. The visibility remains limited, and the misty marine layer blankets the city, hinting at a subdued and contemplative atmosphere. Given the weather's uninviting demeanor, one might find solace in cozy indoor pursuits\u2014perhaps revisiting a favorite bookshop nestled in the Mission or savoring a warm cup in a quiet caf\u00e9, letting the rhythmic sound of the rain against the window set a tranquil backdrop. Dress warmly and comfortably, perhaps in layers, to embrace the chill without hindrance, as you meander through the lovely, albeit damp, streets of your beloved city.",
