    "weather_report": "As dusk approaches in Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a cloak of gray, hinting at the rain showers promised for the afternoon. The chill nips at exposed skin, encouraging the layered warmth of a cozy sweater or light jacket. The air is alive with the promise of a gentle breeze, whispering through the streets at around 13 mph from the north, while the horizon remains somewhat shrouded, likely caught beneath a thin veil of fog or marine layer hugging the bay.\n\nWith precipitation lingering in the forecast at 30%, the city seems to anticipate a dance between drizzle and the shy sun peeking through clouds. Expect temperatures to edge downward into the night, hovering near 44 degrees, with a slightly warm embrace as it nibbles upwards toward 46. For those venturing out, a stroll along the Embarcadero could be quite pleasant; one can savor the brisk air while appreciating the distant silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge against the brooding sky. Tucked away cafes beckon with warm beverages, perfect for warming chilled hands while watching the city transition into its evening glow.",
