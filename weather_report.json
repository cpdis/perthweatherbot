    "weather_report": "Dawn in Subiaco arrives under a clear, untroubled sky, the air still and cool enough to make the first breath feel clean. A faint silver edge is lifting along the eastern rooftops and, with no cloud to soften it, the day promises bright, unwavering light and long, crisp lines of visibility.\n\nAs the sun climbs, expect a full-bore blue day: pleasant and gentle at first, then quickly assertive. The UV index will surge to very high levels typical of early summer, so lean on shade and timing more than bravado. Light, breathable clothing, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen will serve you well; a bottle of water in the bag wouldn\u2019t hurt. Good hours for a quiet lap of the neighborhood or a bike ride are right now through early morning, followed by coffee on a cool verandah. Run errands before the glare grows, hang a wash to dry in the honest light, or slip into a library or gallery through the midday hours. The afternoon looks stark but clean, the kind of clarity that makes colors pop and asks you to be deliberate about where you stand.",
