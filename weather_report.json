    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a clean, inky sky at this small hour, the air settled and dry, the streets hushed. With no cloud to speak of, the night feels transparent and unhurried; UV is effectively asleep, and the stars do the quiet work of illumination. It\u2019s a pleasant, uncomplicated night for a gentle stroll or to crack a window and let the coolness drift in while you read a few more pages.\n\nToward dawn the clarity holds, promising a bright, uncomplicated morning once the sun lifts. Expect the UV to surge quickly after sunrise under these bare skies, so plan for shade where you can: light layers now, then a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen when the day awakens. It looks like a good morning for an early walk before work, a coffee on the veranda, or hanging the washing to let the first light do its patient drying. Simple errands and a steady commute should feel easy beneath a widening blue.",
