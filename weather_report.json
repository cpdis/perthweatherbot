    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crispness that hints at the cold night ahead, with temperatures poised to dip to the mid-forties. The cityscape is bathed in a tranquil clarity, the sky revealing a sleepy blue illuminated only by scattered lights twinkling from the buildings below. The east-northeast breeze, while gentle, adds an invigorating sharpness, perfect for those who revel in the briskness of winter evenings.\n\nTomorrow promises a mostly sunny reprieve, where the sun will stir the city awake, beckoning dwellers to embrace the day with optimism. With a high near fifty-eight, the afternoon will gradually cool, inviting layers to combat the briskness that often lingers. Given the pleasant conditions tomorrow, it may be a good day for quiet strolls along the waterfront or a visit to one of the city's charming cafes, perhaps to savor a warm cup of coffee, as the bay glimmers invitingly. Dress in light layers to fully enjoy the brisk air without sacrificing comfort.",
