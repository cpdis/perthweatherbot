    "weather_report": "As the dawn stretches gently across Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere retains a soft blanket of cloudiness. The temperature rests pleasantly around a mild 52 degrees, accompanied by a subtle breeze from the west southwest that whispers through the streets. While the morning begins with a moody charm, hints of rain gather strength, threatening to unveil themselves later in the day. By the afternoon, the clouds will part slightly, wrestling with the erratic sunshine that breaks through, offering glimpses of a peaked blue sky above the muted gray.\n\nAs the clock ticks towards the late afternoon, prepare for the rain\u2019s arrival\u2014forecasters predict it will join the scene after five o\u2019clock with a 90% chance of soft, persistent showers. Though the higher temperatures flirt with 62 degrees, a quick drop to a cooler 60 will remind you of the city's ever-shifting moods. For today, a lightweight coat or an umbrella will be your best companions\u2014unassuming but essential tools for navigating the coming weather. Given the low visibility often attributed to the marine layer, activities could be as simple yet satisfying as exploring the cozy corners of local coffee shops or settling into a comfortable chair in a bookstore, allowing the sounds of rain to accompany your moments of reflection.",
