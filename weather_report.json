    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a chill permeates the air, whispering promises of rain to come. The clouds, a dense quilt of gray, cast a shroud over the city, obscuring the sky and muting the vibrant lights of urban life below. With temperatures dipping toward 47 degrees, those heading out should don layers\u2014perhaps a soft wool sweater beneath a light raincoat, not only for warmth but to prepare for the showers anticipated after 4 AM. \n\nTonight, the scent of rain mingles with the urban landscape, hinting at a refreshing shift as droplets dance upon pavement. The chance of rain rests at a solid 60%, telling tales of a serenading storm that will usher in a cloudy Sunday, where the high barely climbs above 57. This day, too, will unfurl beneath a blanket of clouds, carrying the lingering promise of moisture. While the prospects of outdoor adventures may be dampened, one might find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, fingers wrapped around a warm cup of coffee, watching rain-soaked streets glisten under the warm glow of streetlamps and gathering stories from the day.",
