    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a soft shroud of rain and cloud cover, casting a muted tone across the cityscape. As temperatures hover around a brisk 57 degrees, then gently dip to 54, the humidity wraps itself around us, promising both dampness and a palpable chill. The atmosphere feels electric with expectation, as the rain\u2014which has settled in firmly\u2014might release between a tenth to a quarter of an inch. A gentle south wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the scent of wet pavement and a sense of renewal, though the pervasive cloudiness leaves little room for sunlight to break through.\n\nTonight, the chance of rain decreases, but the clouds will linger overhead, setting a tranquil scene with a low around 49. While the weather may deter some from outdoor plans, it invites snug evenings indoors. A well-fitted coat, perhaps wool or down, paired with heavy trousers and sturdy shoes will serve you best against the damp. Consider a stroll through a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee or tea, or indulge in the comfort of a late afternoon movie, allowing the gentle cadence of raindrops against windows to be your backdrop. While today may boast an ambiance that feels slightly gloomy, there is beauty and solace in the stillness that comes with rain.",
