    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco arrives uncomplicated and bright, the sky already rinsed clean and set to stay that way into the afternoon. Expect a generous pour of sunshine with crisp visibility and that sharpening spring light; UV will climb quickly around midday, so favor sunscreen, sunglasses, and a brim. The day looks kind and steady rather than dramatic, a clear blue arc inviting unhurried plans.\n\nDress in light layers you can shed as the warmth gathers, breathable fabrics and comfortable shoes for a gentle wander. It\u2019s a good morning to take your coffee outdoors, run a few errands on foot, air the sheets on the line, or thumb through a book on a shaded bench. By early afternoon the brightness will still be unwavering, suited to a quiet loop through the neighborhood or a quick stop at the grocer, finishing with a late lunch in the soft spill of light before it eases toward evening.",
