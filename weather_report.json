    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the night feels clean and unhurried, the sky largely clear and the stars steady, with a few wayward clouds expected to slip in toward dawn. Visibility is good and the air has that pleasing, uncomplicated clarity. It\u2019s the sort of night that invites quiet routines and small comforts.\n\nAfter sunrise, expect a bright start, brushed now and then by scattered cloud but still leaning toward a clear, luminous morning. UV is negligible overnight and will climb quickly once the sun is up; if you\u2019ll be outdoors for any length of time, plan on sunglasses, a hat, and a light touch of sunscreen. Dress in easy layers: a soft jumper or light jacket now, something you can peel back by late morning. The weather suits modest plans\u2014a dawn walk to the bakery, a quick ride for errands, hanging a wash to catch the first light, or simply opening the windows and letting the day breathe through the rooms.",
