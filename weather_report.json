    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere hangs heavy with the promise of rain. The clouds, thick and brooding, obscure the once-clear vistas, casting a gray shroud over the cityscape. The temperatures, already dipping into the chill of the early morning, will struggle to rise much above the mid-fifties, while gusts of wind carry a brisk chill, teasing the imminent downpour. A sense of moisture lingers in the air, a harbinger of the 100% chance of rain expected for the day, accompanied by gusts that could dance at nearly forty miles per hour. \n\nDressed for comfort will be the key; think layers that can be easably adjusted with a cozy scarf and a water-resistant jacket, perfect for navigating the city's undulating streets. Those who venture outside might find solace in the comfort of a nearby caf\u00e9, cupping warm beverages while observing the slick streets glisten in the rain. Alternatively, a leisurely stroll through the quiet, rain-soaked parks may reveal a serene beauty, undisturbed and tranquil, as the city prepares for the deluge ahead, transforming the familiar into a peaceful retreat from the bustling world. In the coming hours, the damp and cloudy scenes will envelop the essence of the city, inviting introspection and simple joys amidst the wet ambiance.",
