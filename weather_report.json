    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush, the sky already rinsing from ink to pale gold. It\u2019s clear now and promises to stay that way, a lucid morning opening into a hard, bright blue. The air feels gentle and dry, the kind that makes sound carry and colours pop. As the sun lifts, it will sharpen quickly; UV will surge through late morning into the afternoon, and the light will have that honest, unblinking glare that makes shadows crisp and eyes squint.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for ease and a touch of care: start with a light layer over breathable clothes, then trade to short sleeves, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a bottle of water. Take a quiet stroll for bread and coffee while the streets are still yawning; hang the washing early or give the garden a quick drink before the sun takes charge. By midday, drift toward shade and cool rooms\u2014an unhurried visit to the library, a tidy-up at home, errands tucked between doorways. Later, if a breeze stirs, a gentle loop through Kings Park or a lazy wander to a local shop will suit the evening\u2019s softer edges.",
