    "weather_report": "As the clock ticked past two in the afternoon on this modestly warm day in Subiaco, the sky dressed itself in a subtle patchwork of scattered clouds, allowing tendrils of sunlight to play gently upon the earth. The air, lightly fragrant with the onset of spring, carries whispers of a luminous day that is neither overzealous nor shy. While the sun does make its occasional bold appearance, the subdued cloud cover offers a comforting veil, ensuring that while the afternoon is kissed by warmth, it is not overwhelmed. For those venturing out, a light jacket or cardigan should suffice, a nod to the mercurial nature of sunshine filtering through this celestial quilt. With UV rays tamed by the cotton-soft clouds, it is a day for leisurely strolls through winding streets or perhaps a leisurely sit on a sun-dappled bench with a book in hand. The day beckons to be savored, inviting one to slow the relentless pace of life, serving as a gentle reminder that beauty often lies in the tranquil and the understated.",
