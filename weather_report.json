    "weather_report": "Subiaco basks under the canvas of a jigsaw sky, where the lighter tones of broken clouds have given way to a tapestry scattered through with patches of ethereal blue. The sun, that elusive artist, dances between cloud tufts, teasing the earth with radiant brushes that promise warmth yet play shadow games. As the afternoon advances into those moments embodying potential and pause, it's a day filled with subtle contradictions. There's a comfort in the embrace of the mellow sun, not too harsh to bite nor too shy to hide, presenting a gentle reminder of summer's approach without its full torrid embrace. The UV index isn't menacingly high, yet wise are those draped in light fabrics of linen or soft cotton, accessorizing with an easygoing hat. This is the kind of day where leisure finds its spell in small pleasures. Perhaps an idle wander through a tree-lined street, basking in nature's hush, or a lingering pause on a park bench with a novel whose pages blend with the sky. Let it be a day where time is felt in the stepping stones of these moments, where solitude replaces haste and simply being is the pursuit.",
