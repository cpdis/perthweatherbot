    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon paints a mosaic of partly sunny skies painted with soft clouds, ushering in a crisp high of around 57 degrees. As the day wears on, temperatures will gracefully recline towards 54, while a gentle northwest breeze whispers through the streets. The atmosphere feels refreshingly cool, yet the warmth of the sun glimmers through the shifting clouds, casting a serene ambiance across the city. Evening promises partially cloudy skies, inviting a tranquil drop to around 45 degrees, ideal for a cozy wrap-up to the day.\n\nWith the delicate presence of fog lingering at the edges of the bay, particularly veiling the Golden Gate, one can appreciate the ethereal silhouettes of the towers amidst a sea of gentle gray. The conditions are ripe for leisurely walks along the waterfront or perhaps indulging in a quiet afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a hot beverage complements the cool air. Dressing in layers would be wise; a light jacket over a soft sweater would strike the perfect balance against the evening chill and occasional breezes. This is a day that beckons quiet reflection and simple pleasures, perfect for savoring what the city has to offer beyond its iconic sights.",
