    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the day, Downtown San Francisco awakens under a clear, crisp sky, the air fresh with the remnants of night. As dawn approaches, the temperature is pleasantly cool, settling in around the low forties. A gentle north northeast wind whispers through the streets, promising a beautiful Tuesday ahead. The forecast suggests that as the sun rises, it will bathe the city in warm golden light, peaking near sixty-three by midday, before gracefully retreating towards more temperate fifty-degree readings in the afternoon. \n\nWhile there is currently no sign of fog to obscure the view, the absence of the marine layer allows for a panorama that invites leisure and exploration. For those venturing into the day, dressing in layers is advisable; a light jacket paired with a long-sleeve shirt will provide comfort against the brisk start while ensuring ease as the sun\u2019s rays begin to warm the surroundings. Today is ideal for a stroll through Golden Gate Park or enjoying a quiet moment at your favorite caf\u00e9, perhaps with a good book, as the city slowly stirs to life, its vibrant energy palpable in the air.",
