    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a hint of chill mingled with the faint scent of moisture. The resplendent cityscape, cloaked in a veil of clouds, reflects the soft glow of streetlights in the early morning gloom. A gentle drizzle persists, teasing the urban rhythm and promising an elusive respite before the sun graces the horizon. Current temperatures hover in the crisp mid-forties, urging early risers to embrace layers; a knitted scarf and a cozy jacket will provide comfort against the brisk breeze that whispers through the streets.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the forecast hints at a gradual transition\u2014a tentative sun peeking through the clouds, battling the stubborn marine layer that hangs low, creating moments of obscured vistas and muted colors. By afternoon, the promise of sun holds, with temperatures modestly reaching the low fifties, inviting those struck by the day's mildness to indulge in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps seek refuge in a quirky caf\u00e9 for a steaming cup of something rich and warm. With the ever-present chance of a sprinkle, it might also be wise to carry an umbrella, just in case the city's whimsical weather stirs the skies anew. Embrace the day, for even in its understated charm, there are stories to uncover and quiet moments to savor within the pulse of the city.",
