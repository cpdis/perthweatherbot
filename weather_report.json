    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco settles into the early hours, a shroud of cloud blankets the skyline, heralding the promise of rain that looms just beyond the horizon. The air is cool, kissed by a gentle breeze that rustles through the streets, carrying the crisp scent of the impending drizzle. The chance of rain persists, but for now, the sky is mostly cloudy, casting muted hues across the landscape. As dawn approaches, there\u2019s a hint of brightness threatening to break through the thick veil\u2014though the chill remains, dipping down to a refreshing low.\n\nFor the day ahead, we can expect patches of sunshine emerging from the scattered clouds, offering a welcome reprieve as temperatures rise slightly, though still maintaining a chill in the air. It promises to be a day that dances with duality: a mix of sunny intervals and lingering gray, ensuring layers will be your friend. A light jacket should suffice, perhaps with a scarf to ward off the residual coolness that clings stubbornly to the afternoon air. Given the varied conditions, a stroll along the waterfront or through the city\u2019s leaf-strewn parks could be quite agreeable, the kind of day that invites quiet reflection or leisurely exploration, punctuated by the gentle whisper of the wind.",
