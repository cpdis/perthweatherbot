    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night unfurls a gentle quilt of clouds, casting a subtle yet serene shadow over the city. As the clock ushers in the early hours, a hint of moisture lingers in the air, suggesting the possibility of light rain. The temperatures are cool, wrapping you in a crisp embrace that nudges you to reach for your favorite sweater when stepping outdoors.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the forecast holds a promise of slightly warmer rays. The morning\u2019s gentle sun will dance with occasional clouds, hinting at a day where some light showers may linger, but primarily, expect patches of blue to break through the gray. The cityscape, often cloaked in fog, appears to breathe easier today, with visibility likely enhancing as the sun climbs. For those seeking respite from the chill, layering is advisable; a light jacket, with a scarf to guard against a brisk northeast breeze, will keep you comfortably prepared. Take a stroll to enjoy a quiet caf\u00e9 nook or wander the park, observing how the city wakes, alive with the soft murmur of morning.",
