    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun reigns supreme under an expansive blue sky, casting a warm light over the urban landscape. As temperatures approach the mid-sixties, the day feels fresh yet inviting, with gentle north-northwest breezes whispering through the streets. Wisps of the marine layer are barely perceptible, leaving the view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the surrounding hills unclouded and sharp. There is no sign of fog to temper the warmth, making for a remarkably clear day as sunlight dances on the bay's surface.\n\nAs the afternoon unfolds and temperatures begin to dip toward the low sixties, one might consider layering up slightly, with a light jacket for those hours that feel cooler. This is an ideal time for a stroll through Golden Gate Park or a quiet moment sipping coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where the city buzzes softly yet vibrantly. As evening approaches, a mostly clear sky promises a tranquil night ahead, perfect for a leisurely walk along the waterfront or catching a glimpse of the stars unfurling above the iconic skyline. The charm of San Francisco today invites exploration and simple pleasures, enriching the experience of all who venture out.",
