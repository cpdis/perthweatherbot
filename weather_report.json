The dawn breathes softly, hinting at a day yet to unfold, while the faint west southwest winds flirt quietly at 3 mph, nearly imperceptible but carrying whispers of the ocean\u2019s embrace.\n\nCome Friday, the city will awaken partly sunny, though the sun\u2019s warmth will play coy, reaching a high near 55 before retreating to a cool 52 by afternoon. The marine layer, a signature of this coastal enclave, may linger, adding an element of intrigue to the golden vistas. The scene will beckon for layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater paired with a light jacket, perfect for transitioning from the optimism of sunlit streets to shaded corners where the chill still lingers. \n\nAs you contemplate the day ahead, consider a visit to one of the local coffee shops, where the aroma of freshly brewed espresso mingles with the warmth of conversation, or perhaps a leisurely walk along the waterfront. The subtle dance of fog and sunlight promises moments of quiet reflection, making it a splendid opportunity to lose yourself in the charm of this storied city before it awakens fully to the bustle of a new day.",
