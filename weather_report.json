    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes the early hour of a winter\u2019s night, a soft drizzle begins to coat the streets of Downtown San Francisco, wrapping the city in a chilly embrace. The clouds loom overhead, shrouding the skyline and the distant Golden Gate Bridge, casting a muted grey filtered through sporadic droplets. With temperatures dipping to around 47 degrees, the humidity swells, giving the air a palpable weight as it preserves the evening chill in the bones. The wind, whispering at around seven miles per hour, carries with it the scent of the sea, creating an atmosphere layered with the soothing sound of raindrops tapping against window panes.\n\nTomorrow promises to deliver more of the same\u2014an uninterrupted downpour that will drench the city through the day. The anticipated high of 56 degrees hardly suggests any warmth, as the clouds will steadfastly dominate the sky, obscuring the sun's rays in favor of an unyielding pallor. With a certainty of rain, here\u2019s a gentle reminder to don that water-resistant coat and sturdy shoes, essential for navigating the slick sidewalks. Perhaps it\u2019s the perfect time to settle into a cozy caf\u00e9, cup in hand, watching the world drip by, or to take a reflective stroll along the waterfront where the fog intertwines with the bay, offering moments of solitude and quiet inspiration in this lively yet muted city landscape.",
