    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day awakens to predominantly cloudy skies, heavy with the promise of rain that will soon arrive. A brisk east-southeast wind stirs quietly, portending a shift as temperatures hover around the cool mid-fifties, a stark reminder of the lingering winter chill. As the clock approaches late afternoon, the rain will begin its steady march into the city, with an impressive 90% chance of precipitation ushering in droplets that will soon coat the streets and soak the earth, bringing a tactile refreshment that many find invigorating.\n\nTonight, expect the rain to intensify, as a south wind picks up, whipping through the streets with gusts that could flirt with 43 mph. With a low settling around fifty degrees but rising through the night, the air will feel damp and alive. A true San Francisco evening, where the mist kisses the city\u2019s skyline, and sights like the Golden Gate Bridge emerge momentarily before vanishing into the fog. As you venture out, it is wise to adorn oneself in layers\u2014a waterproof jacket, a sturdy umbrella, and perhaps some sturdy shoes that can withstand the slippery sidewalks. This is not the evening for grand outdoor outings; instead, consider wandering into a cozy caf\u00e9, letting the rain play its symphony on the windowpanes while you sip a warm drink and unwind as the city harmonizes with the whispers of the storm.",
