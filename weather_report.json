The high is expected to reach around 55 degrees, before settling back into the low 50s by afternoon. There\u2019s an invigorating clarity to the day, devoid of fog and marine layer, which often envelops the Bay. Given these conditions, layers are recommended\u2014a light sweater or jacket for the cooler moments, perhaps a scarf to tackle the brisk breeze while strolling through the city streets. It\u2019s a perfect opportunity for a leisurely walk through Golden Gate Park, where the beauty of nature harmonizes with the cheerful atmosphere, or a serene visit to one of the local cafes, where warmth and camaraderie abound, welcoming anyone seeking refuge from the chill outside.",
