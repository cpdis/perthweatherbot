    "weather_report": "As the early morning hush envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp with temperatures dipping near the cool 49 degrees. The lingering faint clouds scatter across the night, hinting at a day that promises more light. As dawn breaks, the possibility of a drizzle lingers briefly in the hour between seven and eight, yet the sunshine is poised to claim dominion as the hours progress. By midday, the temperature will hover around 60, gradually descending to a mellow 56 as afternoon nudges in, accompanied by a gentle south wind whispering through the streets.\n\nWhile the expected clarity is certainly inviting, expect a slight veil of fog lingering around the edges of the city, particularly near the Golden Gate, where the marine layer often plays hide and seek with the landscape. For those venturing out today, layers are key: a light jacket will provide comfort in the morning chill, whilst a short-sleeve option might be just right when the sun warms the day. Such weather sets the stage for a leisurely stroll through the winding streets or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, perhaps indulging in a warm drink while people-watching. This quiet Sunday beckons you to appreciate the simple pleasures of city life, as each moment drifts into a pleasant tapestry woven with whispers of the sea and the rustling of autumn leaves.",
