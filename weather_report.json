    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks gently over San Francisco, the day begins with whispers of fog lingering in the coastal air. The marine layer, soft and ethereal, might still clutch the heights before 10 a.m., but expect the sun to assert its presence shortly after, casting a soft glow across the city. The temperature, a modest embrace hovering near fifty-six, suggests a brisk freshness that beckons for layers, making a light jacket or a cozy sweater an excellent choice as you venture out to savor the morning. \n\nThroughout the day, the blend of sun and just a whisper of clouds promises an invigorating urban experience. The cool breeze from the north adds a crispness to the atmosphere, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet moment with a coffee in one of the many inviting caf\u00e9s nestled in the heart of Downtown. As the afternoon unfolds, consider finding solace in one of the city's beautiful parks, where you can enjoy the picturesque scenery enveloped in that distinctive San Francisco charm. The fading light may usher in a gentle chill, so keeping that jacket handy for the evening will ensure a delightful close to your day.",
