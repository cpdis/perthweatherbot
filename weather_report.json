    "weather_report": "Subiaco leans into late afternoon under a clean, generous sky. The day has been glass-clear and sunny; the sun still carries a little bite, though the UV is easing now from insistent to mild as shadows lengthen. Expect a dry, tranquil evening with sharp visibility and, later, a neat spill of stars. It\u2019s the sort of weather that asks little of you: sunglasses for the last light, light layers for now, a soft jacket once the warmth slips from the pavement. A short wander to the shops, a lazy spin on the bike, or a quiet sit outside with a book would suit the hour. As dusk settles, the air turns pleasantly cool and steady, the kind of clarity that makes small conversations and small errands feel just right.",
