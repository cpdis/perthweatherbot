    "weather_report": "As the evening envelops Downtown San Francisco, the city is draped in a veil of thick clouds, from which light rain begins to fall, accentuated by gusty winds that whisper restlessness through the streets. Tonight, temperatures hover around a cool 54, creeping upward as the night progresses, with occasional gusts that remind us of nature\u2019s wild spirit. The chance of precipitation looms at an impressive 90%, bringing with it the promise of a few more drops before dawn. Those who venture outdoors will likely find the air fresh and brisk, urging cozy layers \u2013 a warm jacket, perhaps a scarf, and water-resistant shoes would be wise companions against the chill.\n\nCome Friday, the forecast hints at a softer embrace, with only a slight chance of lingering rain before the morning gives way to scattered clouds. Highs will gently climb to 60 before settling back into a cooler afternoon, making it an ideal day for a quiet stroll through the city\u2019s storied avenues or enjoying a warm drink from a favorite caf\u00e9. As the fog slowly lifts, revealing the outlines of familiar hills and angular architecture, the day offers a subdued yet serene canvas for reflection or comfort. Traditional activities like a visit to the bustling Ferry Building or a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero provide delightful escapes, infusing the day with calm amidst the vestiges of winter\u2019s chill and the stirring anticipation of brighter days ahead.",
