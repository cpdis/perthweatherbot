    "weather_report": "As the night lingers over Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself wrapped in a thick shroud of rainclouds, echoing the gentle rhythm of raindrops above. At this early hour, the air is cool, and the wind whispers insistently from the south, carrying with it a promise of moisture. One can almost feel the weight of the atmosphere, as if the sky were contemplating its next release, with a 60% chance of precipitation lingering like unspoken words. The streets appear dimly lit, but perhaps it's a perfect moment to cozy up in a favorite caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm brew as the world outside gathers its quiet rhythm.\n\nAs dawn breaks, Thursday will greet us with continued rain, the high creeping up to a mild 62 degrees. The clouds will remain stubbornly in place, hinting at a day more suited for introspection than for adventure. As temperatures begin their slow descent towards the afternoon, donning layers would be wise; perhaps a light waterproof jacket over a snug sweater to fend off the chill. Be prepared for gusts that steal the breath away, and an umbrella will be more than just a stylish accessory; it will be a trusty companion for the day ahead. With all this rain, it may not be the day for an impromptu stroll along the waterfront, but rather a chance to explore the hidden gems of the city\u2014think art galleries, independent bookstores, or even the warmth of a local bakery, where the scent of fresh pastries might just rival the sweet respite from the rain.",
