    "weather_report": "Subiaco steps into the early afternoon under an unblemished blue, the sort of clean, hard light that sharpens edges and makes colors ring true. The forecast holds that clarity through the rest of the day, with the sun staying assertive and the sky largely free of interruption. Expect a bright, very sunny stretch; the UV index will be on the high side through midafternoon before easing as the day tilts toward evening. It should feel warm in the sun and gentler wherever there\u2019s a patch of shade, a day that flatters simple plans.\n\nLean into light, breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a confident sweep of sunscreen; bring water and take the shady side of the street. A quiet lunch on a verandah suits the moment, or a meander to the shops and back while the sky is still wide open. Save an unhurried loop through a nearby park or a small errand on the bike for late afternoon when the light softens and the heat loosens its grip; if you\u2019d rather linger indoors, a gallery or library visit makes easy company for such a crystalline day.",
