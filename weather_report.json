    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a mostly sunny sky that has coaxed a gentle chill into the air. The temperature hovers around a cool 58 degrees, dipping slightly as the light wanes. A soft west wind whispers through the streets, creating a serene atmosphere that mirrors the fading daylight. As the sun draws closer to the horizon, the clarity of the day remains, revealing the distant silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge, albeit shrouded in a delicate veil of marine layer that clings softly to the coastal edges.\n\nAs night approaches, the promise of a partly cloudy sky beckons. The low tonight will settle around 49 degrees, and a brisk north-northwest wind will dance through the city, occasionally rustling a few leaves and sending chillier breezes through the alleyways. For those venturing outside, layering will be key\u2014an elegant sweater or light jacket will keep you comfortable against the caress of the evening air. Perhaps a contemplative stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9 will serve as perfect remedies for this tranquil evening, blending the coolness of winter with the pulse of the vibrant city.",
