    "weather_report": "Edgewater wakes under a spotless sky, the light already clean and generous, sharpening edges and lending puddles a bit of sparkle. Visibility is excellent, the sort of morning where distant rooftops feel a step closer. With clear skies at dawn and after, expect abundant sunshine through the morning; if this holds, the afternoon should stay mostly bright as well. UV will build as the sun climbs \u2014 not fierce in late winter, but enough to warrant sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen if you linger outdoors.\n\nIt reads as a pleasant day: crisp in the shade, comfortable in the sun. Dress in easy layers \u2014 a light sweater or jacket you can shrug off, comfortable shoes for unhurried errands. Good hours for a riverside amble, a bicycle spin to the post office, or washing the windows while the sun warms the glass. Bring a book to a sunny bench, check on the houseplants, let the dog choose the longer route; the air invites unhurried, useful movement.",
