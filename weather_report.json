    "weather_report": "A quiet, predawn hush sits over Katy. The most recent forecast showed scattered clouds through late afternoon and early evening, the kind that drift like loose pages and let starlight and city glow filter through. At this hour the sun is still a rumor, UV essentially nil, and visibility should feel clean and uncomplicated, with only a thin gauze of cloud softening the sky.\n\nAs daylight unfolds, expect intervals of sunshine rather than a blazing spotlight, with UV likely staying modest once the sun climbs; sunglasses will be useful when the breaks arrive. Plan for comfort: a light layer or two for the morning chill, something you can shed toward midday, and shoes fit for an easy stroll. This looks like a day for ordinary pleasures\u2014brew a second cup, take a short neighborhood walk when the first light brightens the pavement, run an errand before lunch, or read by a window where the sun comes and goes like a polite houseguest.",
