    "weather_report": "Evening settles softly over Osborne Park with a clear, uncomplicated sky and a clean edge to the air. Stars step forward one by one, hinting at a night that stays cloudless and calm. There\u2019s no bite from the sun now; UV is effectively asleep, leaving the streets with a gentle, unhurried glow. Expect the clarity to hold through the small hours, which usually makes for a bright, decisive sunrise and a quick climb in UV once morning gets going.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of night for light layers\u2014long sleeves or a easy jacket will feel just right if you wander out. A quiet walk to clear the day from your head, a cup of tea on the porch, windows cracked to let in the cool, or a tidy of tomorrow\u2019s bag all fit the mood. If you\u2019ll be outdoors after breakfast, plan on sunglasses and sunscreen; under skies this clean, the sun tends to mean business.",
