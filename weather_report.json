    "weather_report": "South Fremantle wakes under a low lid of cloud, the air salted and a little heavy. Light showers are likely to slip in from late morning through early afternoon, more a passing peppering than a drenching. Sunshine will be scarce, arriving in thin, milky flashes between grey sheets; the day\u2019s clarity feels muted, the light flat, the horizon slightly smudged. Even so, it\u2019s midsummer, and when the cloud loosens the UV will bite more than the sky suggests.\n\nIt looks more gentle than grim. Wear breathable layers with a light rain shell, shoes you don\u2019t mind getting damp, and keep sunglasses and sunscreen handy for those sudden brightenings. Good weather for small errands, a slow lap of South Terrace between showers, a quiet caf\u00e9 and a paperback, or a brief seaside walk to breathe in the wind and watch the gulls argue with the squall. Save the long beach laze for another day; this one asks for unhurried plans and a flexible mood.",
