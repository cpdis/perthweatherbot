    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is thick with a heavy mist, the early morning rain tapping softly against the pavement. The once vibrant skyline is cloaked in a veil of clouds, delivering a low and muted palette. The air carries a crisp chill, inviting wrapped scarves and sturdy umbrellas for those venturing out. With temperatures set to hover in the upper 50s throughout the day and a steady southern breeze stirring the damp air, the promise of rain lingers\u2014an unyielding 90% chance has settled over the city.\n\nToday is not marked for sunlit strolls but rather for lingering indoors, perhaps by the warmth of a caf\u00e9, where the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee envelops patrons seeking refuge from the fog. For those inclined to venture beyond their doorsteps, layered clothing would be wise\u2014perhaps a light raincoat coupled with a warm sweater. Mornings like this are a gentle reminder to embrace the cozy side of life, where a short visit to a local gallery or a leisurely read at a nearby bookstore feels entirely appropriate as the soft drizzle continues.",
