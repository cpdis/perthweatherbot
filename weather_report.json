    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks into the late hours tonight, Downtown San Francisco basks under a clear sky, the air fresh and crisp, hinting at the subtle shift from day to night. The temperatures nestle comfortably in the low forties, promising a gentle ascent to around 44 as the night progresses. An unobtrusive north-northeast breeze whispers through the city, caressing the outlines of the iconic skyline and beckoning a moment of reflection amidst the urban pulse.\n\nCome Monday, the sun will rise brightly, illuminating the city with a warmth that slowly transforms the chill of the overnight hours into a moderate embrace. The high meanders close to 57, before retreating to 55 by the afternoon, a gentle reminder that even in winter, San Francisco holds onto a flicker of leniency in its climate. As the blue expanse prevails, the absence of fog allows the Golden Gate Bridge to stand boldly against the backdrop, an invitation to explore the park trails or enjoy a slow meander along the Embarcadero, perhaps savoring a warm drink at a quaint caf\u00e9. Layers will serve the day well\u2014a light jacket against the afternoon breeze should suffice for comfort. With the canvas of a sunny day, it presents an opportunity to embrace life at a leisurely pace, inviting discovery in the city's many corners while reveling in its breathtaking scenery.",
