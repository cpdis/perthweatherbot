    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is draped in a dense gray quilt, signaling the rain that is well underway this afternoon. The sky is a heavy, solid mass of clouds, letting only the faintest hint of light struggle through, creating a somber but serene backdrop for the familiar cityscape. The air is brisk, invigorated by a steadier south-southwest wind that tosses it around like leaves in the autumn. Rain is expected to continue, the sort that softly envelops the city in a refreshing embrace, as new puddles form on sidewalks and narrow streets. \n\nAs evening approaches, the temperature will hover comfortably in the mid-fifties, but the overall vibe suggests you would want to bundle up a bit\u2014perhaps a warm, water-resistant coat layered over a cozy sweater, paired with adequate footwear for wet surfaces. Indoors might be the best refuge this evening, where one can savor a warm cup of tea or coffee, perhaps while indulging in a good book or catching up on a favorite series. For those who feel adventurous, a walk under an umbrella could unveil the city's quieter corners, where the sound of raindrops plays a soft melody, creating a distinct charm in the muted light of a rainy San Francisco afternoon.",
