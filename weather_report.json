    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a cloak of clouds, thickening with the promise of rain. There\u2019s an air of tranquility, quieted by the subtle whisper of winds, barely rustling through the streets as they prepare for the slight drizzle that might grace the city after dawn. This evening\u2019s chill nudges temperatures down to a cool 49 degrees, inviting warmth in layers. For those venturing out, a light jacket wrapped around a cozy sweater should suffice, perhaps a scarf to ward off the crispness.\n\nTomorrow unfolds a different tapestry, painted with the hues of impending rain. There\u2019s a notable chance for drizzle in the morning, escalating to light rainfall by midday. As clouds scuttle across the sky, the sun may decide to peek through, casting a gentle light on the city, albeit briefly. Expect temperatures to hover near a cool 61 degrees, eventually dipping a little lower. The wind, brisk and playful, will dance between 5 to 18 mph, stirring the leaves and ruffling hats along the sidewalks. As the rain graces the ground with its gentle touch, consider embracing the day with a warm mug in hand, perhaps wandering to a nearby caf\u00e9 or indulging in a good book at home, creating your own pockets of comfort amid the drizzled landscapes.",
