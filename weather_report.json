    "weather_report": "Midday finds Subiaco under a pewter sky, the light dulled and the air smelling of wet pavement. Bands of moderate rain sweep through, with only stingy hints of brightness between them; if the sun shows, it will be a fleeting cameo. Expect a soft, hazy clarity today\u2014distant edges blurred, streets dark and reflective. UV exposure stays muted under this cloud deck, low to perhaps moderate in any brief bright patch, but generally the day leans gray and damp rather than sunstruck.\n\nIt\u2019s a rain-jacket and comfortable, water\u2011resistant shoes sort of day; a compact umbrella earns its keep. The weather isn\u2019t harsh so much as persistent, better suited to errands that keep you lightly in and out of doorways, a slow coffee while showers pass, a wander through a gallery or the library, or a short amble between bursts of rain to stretch the legs and admire the sheen on the jacarandas. If you\u2019re staying in, put a pot on the stove or tend to the little chores that never demand sunshine. The day will be gentle if you move with it.",
