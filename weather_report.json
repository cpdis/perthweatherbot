    "weather_report": "Subiaco is settled and quiet under a flawless night sky, the air clear and a touch crisp, the kind of darkness that sharpens the stars and hushes the streets. With no cloud to speak of, visibility feels clean and untroubled, and the night has that gentle, practical calm that makes it easy to think, to breathe, to sleep.\n\nThe small hours look to stay clear right through to first light, and sunrise should arrive in a bright rush. Expect a radiant morning with the UV climbing quickly after the sun is up, as is usual here in early summer; plan shade and sunscreen once the day gets going. It reads as a pleasant start that may turn stark under the midday glare, so dress in light layers now, then shift to breathable fabrics, a hat, sunglasses, and a dab of SPF in your pocket. Good hours for a quiet walk before dawn, a slow stretch on the veranda, watering the garden, or a quick ride to the shops soon after sunrise. If you can, run errands early, then let the brightest part of the day belong to the indoors and the cool side of the house.",
