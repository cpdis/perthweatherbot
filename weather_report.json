    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a chilly hint of moisture that wraps around the city in a soft embrace. Rain is likely through the early hours, creating a muted symphony of droplets that will dance against windows and streets, shedding a gloss on the familiar views. While clouds cloak the sky, revealing little of the starlit canvas above, the potential for intermittent rain suggests that the vibrancy of the city will yield to a tranquil, reflective mood. The temperature drifts gently, rising slightly as the night unfolds, inviting residents to layer up in comfortable textiles against the cool breath of a southeast wind.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the day promises a tentative alliance between rain and sun, with clouds occasionally yielding to sunlight in a flirtation that may brighten spirits. The humidity will linger, and a hint of warmth will be fleeting, meaning that a smart choice of clothing would involve both a water-resistant jacket and layers that can be adapted to shifting temperatures. As rain begins to wane, consider taking a leisurely stroll through the neighborhoods, pausing at local cafes for the warmth of a drink or perhaps a visit to one of the city\u2019s many boutiques that offer a refuge from the cool breeze. Enjoy the quiet allure of a city in transition, where nature continues its gentle governance over urban life.",
