    "weather_report": "As the twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a soft drizzle whispers through the streets, cloaking the city in a veil of moisture. The atmosphere is thick with clouds that weave a tapestry of grey across the skyline, hinting at the showers which will soon become a steadfast rain. The temperature, hovering around the cool edge of the night, brings a crispness that beckons for a warm jacket. The air is imbued with the scent of impending rain, creating a serene yet slightly somber ambiance, perhaps nudging one towards the comfort of a cozy caf\u00e9 or a quiet spot to read.\n\nTomorrow promises to greet us with a relentless downpour, the kind that makes one want to curl up with a steaming cup of tea. Expect the high to be just on the cooler side, accentuated by gusty winds that may rustle fallen leaves along the pavement. As the marine layer tucks in around the hills, visibility may be muted, lending a hushed quality to the city's usual vibrancy. A stroll through the neighborhoods might not be the most inviting of pursuits, yet a visit to the local bookstores or art galleries could offer a reprieve from the wet weather, inviting the mind to wander while the rain harmonizes with the soothing clatter of an umbrella against the cobblestones.",
