With a promising high near 68, the air will take on a crispness, inviting that warm light to dance playfully across the city\u2019s hills. The vigor of a northern breeze whispers through the streets, stirring the leaves and bringing with it a vibrant refreshment. As we move toward the afternoon, temperatures will gracefully slide down to a comfortable 63, beckoning those who relish the day's mild embrace. \n\nTonight, the clarity of the day will flow seamlessly into a tranquil evening, as the temperature hovers around 54, teasingly rising to a gentle 56. The winds will soften, but the night will still carry their lingering whispers. Given this splendid scene, a light jacket would serve well for the evening stroll\u2014an exploration of the city\u2019s quiet charm as the lights begin to twinkle and the night settles in. An afternoon spent sipping coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9 or taking a leisurely walk along the waterfront would be particularly pleasant, a simple yet fulfilling way to immerse oneself in the heart of the city on such a beautiful day.",
