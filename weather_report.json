Expect dampness before dawn dissipates into the promise of a brighter Thursday. Tonight\u2019s low settles at a crisp 52, hinting at a chill in the air, soon to lift as temperatures rise to a more comfortable 54 under a mostly cloudy sky. The south-southwest wind plays its part, creating a soothing symphony, with gusts that dance playfully at 29 mph. The likelihood of rainfall hangs at a significant 90%, though it remains light\u2014likely less than a tenth of an inch, leaving only a glistening trace on the sidewalks.\n\nTomorrow brings a welcome transition, as the sun begins its reign with a high near 62. Overcast will give way to brilliant clarity, though the afternoon might cool slightly to around 60. A gentle west wind will encourage the lingering warmth through its subtle gusts. While the evening wears its misty cloak, tonight is not one for outdoor ventures; perhaps a quiet gathering indoors with a good book or spirited conversation would cast a cozy glow. Those venturing out might opt for a light jacket, shielding from the damp, while embracing the serenity of a city lulled by the rhythm of the rain.",
