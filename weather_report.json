    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a sky scrubbed clean, the morning sun sharpening edges and brightening verandas. Clear skies look set to hold through lunchtime, which means full, unfiltered sunshine and a UV bite that climbs quickly by late morning. It feels kind now, a companionable warmth with crisp light and long shadows, but by early afternoon the glare will be fierce and the day a shade unforgiving.\n\nDress light and breathable, a brim to your hat, dark glasses, and a steady veil of sunscreen; keep water close. Good hours for hanging the washing, a gentle walk for coffee and bread, or a quiet errand before the sun hits its stride; a little garden pottering now, then retreat to the library or a cool room as the light hardens. If you\u2019re out later, favor the tree-lined streets and let the day set the pace\u2014bright, lucid, and demanding, but beautiful in its austerity.",
