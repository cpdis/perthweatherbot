    "weather_report": "A grey afternoon has settled over Subiaco, the light turned silvery and soft, with showers beginning to patter in as evening drifts closer. Expect light rain through the late day and into the night, more of a persistent misting than a downpour, the kind that blurs the edges of buildings and turns the pavement into a mirror. Sunshine will be scarce, with only occasional thin breaks if you\u2019re lucky; the UV is low now and will stay that way as the sun slides toward an early spring sunset. It feels mild but damp, the air gentle on the skin and the sky a woolen blanket. A light waterproof jacket, closed shoes, and perhaps a small umbrella will make the errand run or commute more comfortable. Given the hour, this is weather for an unhurried stop at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, a quiet browse in a bookshop before dinner, or a simple, pleasing task at home while the rain taps out its own metronome.",
