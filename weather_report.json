As the sun rises, it lifts the veil of clouds overhead to reveal a predominantly sunny sky, though not without a touch of coolness clinging to the air. With temperatures beginning at a brisk 44 degrees, a delicate layer of warmth may be needed\u2014a light sweater or a thin jacket will serve you well until the sun fully asserts itself. The northwest winds, gentle at first, will awaken with an easy breeze of up to 12 mph, providing just enough movement to keep the air fresh and invigorating.\n\nAs the hours unfold, expect the sun\u2019s presence to bloom, with a high reaching near 55 degrees, before easing back toward a cooler 52 in the afternoon. The day calls for simple, grounding activities; perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the salty breeze mingles with the scent of freshly brewed coffee from local cafes. Or consider settling into a cozy spot with a good book, enjoying the slow cadence of city life as you sip something warm, letting the serene atmosphere wash over you. In a place where the fog often enchants, today offers its charms through clarity and calm\u2014an invitation to breathe deeply and relish the pleasures of a quiet urban Sunday.",
