    "weather_report": "Midday in Perth arrives with a clean, open light, the kind that sharpens edges and makes the pavement shimmer. Expect a largely clear early afternoon, then a soft turn toward light showers by late day. The sun feels assertive now; UV is likely very high through the early afternoon, so shade, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are your friends. Air remains bright and dry at first, with decent clarity, before clouds drift in and the first patter of rain smooths the afternoon\u2019s glare.\n\nDress in breathable layers you won\u2019t mind carrying later, and slip a compact umbrella or light shell into your bag for the homeward stretch. It\u2019s a good hour for small errands, a shaded walk to clear the head, or tending to quick jobs that benefit from the daylight. As the clouds gather, let the weather nudge you indoors for a quiet task: filing the week\u2019s papers, browsing a bookshop, or sitting by a cafe window to watch the street darken and gleam.",
