    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city is shrouded in a heavy blanket of clouds, promising another day of rain. The air is thick with moisture; visibility is limited, giving the promise of a drizzly afternoon that will gradually soak the streets and parks. As temperatures hover around the mid-50s, the south southeast winds whip through the city, carrying with them gusts that dance eagerly through the fog. Although the Golden Gate Bridge stands as a sentinel, its beauty is dampened by the thick marine layer that cloaks its silhouette, while the distant hills are softened into an indistinct haze.\n\nWith an 80% chance of rain looming large today, it\u2019s wise to dress in layers\u2014think waterproof jackets and sturdy shoes that can withstand the dampness. While the vibrancy of the bustling streets may be muted in the wet chill, consider indulging in the cozy ambiance of a local caf\u00e9 or exploring the warmth of museums downtown. As the rain patters against windowpanes, finding solace in a book or leisurely sipping a warming beverage can turn this gray day into a moment of delightful retreat from the world outside.",
