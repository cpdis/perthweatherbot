    "weather_report": "In the still hours of the night, Downtown San Francisco lies under a veil of soft clouds, the air thick with the promise of moisture. As we hover above the Golden Gate Bridge, the chance of rain lingers, a whispering reminder of nature's unpredictability. The temperature rests gently around 56 degrees, with a gentle south wind teasing through the streets. For those who venture out before sunrise, a light jacket should provide sufficient warmth against the coolness, while the possibility of brief showers warrants an umbrella tucked under one arm.\n\nAs dawn approaches, expect a slight chance of rain to persist until the late afternoon. The skies, although predominantly cloudy, will unveil moments of muted brightness, reminiscent of a watercolor painting draped in grays and blues. Highs could reach near 62 degrees, gradually descending as the day matures. While the marine layer may linger along the coast, its effects will be felt more subtly inland, leaving the air a bit heavier but still inviting for leisurely pursuits. Given the day's more subdued nature, an afternoon spent exploring local caf\u00e9s or indulging in a quiet read at a favorite spot could prove delightful. Dress in layers, allowing for the transition from the cool morning air to the more temperate afternoon, and perhaps consider donning a scarf for an added touch of comfort against the San Francisco chill that can grip unexpectedly.",
