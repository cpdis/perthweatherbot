As the sun rises higher, expect a mild warmth to accompany your steps, potentially mingling with a gentle breeze that whispers reminders of spring\u2019s vigor. Attire yourself in light but layered clothing to accommodate the morning\u2019s cooler welcome, and consider bringing sunglasses to shield your eyes against the brightness.\n\nFor those about to embark into this inviting day, it\u2019s perfect for a walk through the streets where trees sway lightly, or perhaps for savoring a cup of coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, soaking in the sunshine as it filters through leaves.
