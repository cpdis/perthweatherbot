    "weather_report": "As the hands of the clock gracefully make their way to mid-afternoon, Subiaco is draped in a still and serene blanket of clear sky, not marred by a single blemish. The sun smiles broadly down on the city, casting its golden light in a performance only fit for a cloudless theater. Wear your beloved sunglasses today, they will be your faithful companion in this luminous spectacle.\n\nGossamer threads of light knit the azure dome overhead, serving as a perfect backdrop for the day's leisurely unfoldings. The current conditions suggest an afternoon of captivating clarity, promising an extended period of gentle sunlight and a relatively low UV index. Garbed in light layers, one could relish in a quiet walk through the park, or perhaps an alfresco lunch at a charming patio. As day gently transitions into evening, the radiant sun's reticent withdrawal paints a portrait of quiet elegance against the sky's canvas.",
