    "weather_report": "As the sun dips ever so slowly, painting the sky in muted colors of evening, Subiaco surrenders to a gentle melancholy of light rain. The day has been a tapestry of soft drizzles, leaving a coolness in the air that's both refreshing and soothing, like a distant memory of spring. The afternoon rain, while unremarkable in its persistence, has lent a poetic gloss to the streets, glistening under the descending dusk light, making the world shimmer with tales untold. It may not have been a day for sunbathing, but it was one full of its own quiet charm.\n\nThese soft showers contribute a welcomed break from the relentless summer sun, a time to reflect indoors or explore the rain-dappled streets under the shelter of an umbrella, charmingly setting the stage for intimate conversations and warm cups of tea. Wearing light layers and a trusty raincoat ensures one remains comfortably dry, while sturdy shoes navigate the slick city pavements with ease. There is beauty in the calm rhythm of raindrops, a gentle lulling, coaxing you to embrace a cozy corner with a book or perhaps venture out for an atmospheric stroll. So in this tender meeting of day and rain, life in Subiaco beckons softly, whispering stories of serenity and calm.",
