    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun graces the sky with a gentle warmth, its rays pouring over the city, bathing it in a crisp light that dances across the skyline. The chill in the air, as it hovers just above the 50s, suggests that a light jacket or a cozy sweater will be your faithful companion as you wander. The ever-present winds from the north tease the bay, ensuring that any chance of fog remains at bay, leaving a clear vista of the Golden Gate Bridge and the expansive ocean beyond. \n\nAs the afternoon carries on, temperatures will dip slightly, welcoming the cool embrace of evening that hints at the coming night. The stars will soon begin to emerge, twinkling against the backdrop of a moonlit sky, enticing those with a spirit for calm solitude to stroll along the Embarcadero or enjoy the lively hum of a local caf\u00e9. With the night settling into a delicate quietude, a warm drink may provide the perfect end to a day washed in sun and shadow.",
