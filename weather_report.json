    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is quilted with broken cloud, the moon and a few stubborn stars slipping through the seams. The air feels gentle rather than sharp, the sort that invites an unhurried breath at the back door. UV is essentially asleep now, and there\u2019s little in the way of sunshine until morning; the night has that velvety, muted clarity where streetlights pool softly and sounds carry a little farther than usual.\n\nToward the small hours and into dawn, the cloud looks set to linger in pieces, likely giving the sunrise a pale, filtered glow rather than a blaze. It should feel pleasant in a low-key way\u2014unfussy and walkable. Dress with a light layer or long sleeves you can push up as you move, and consider a hat or sunglasses later in the morning if the gaps widen and the UV wakes up. Good night for domestic puttering, a short, contemplative stroll, or sketching tomorrow\u2019s list; early risers might enjoy a quiet lap of the neighborhood before coffee, watching the day sift in through the clouds.",
