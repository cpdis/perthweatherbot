    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is swept clean and untroubled, a clear, quiet dome over sleeping streets. The air feels dry and calm, the kind that carries sound a little farther and cools the edges of the night. With no cloud about, the predawn hours should remain crisp and lucid.\n\nAfter sunrise, expect a bright, glass-clear day with abundant sunshine. The UV will build quickly once the light sharpens, likely modest early and stronger through late morning into early afternoon; bring a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen even if the breeze feels kind. Dress in light layers: something long-sleeved to greet the cool morning, easy to shed as the day opens up. It looks like a pleasant one for ordinary rituals\u2014an unhurried walk for coffee, airing the house, a quick turn through the garden or a small errand on foot\u2014while keeping to shade when the sun sits high. Later, a book on a balcony or a tidy of the desk by an open window would suit the clear, steady mood.",
