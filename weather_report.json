    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Katy with a quilt of broken clouds drifting overhead, the moon and a few brave stars slipping in and out like shy guests. The day itself wore a soft, changeable light\u2014sun arriving in intervals, never harsh, with a modest midday UV that would have nipped only the inattentive; now, after dusk, UV is essentially absent. Visibility feels serviceable rather than crystal, edges a touch muted by the cloud cover. The forecast offered no hint of rain, just those shifting clouds and the mild temperament they bring.\n\nFor comfort, think in layers: a light sweater or jacket over an easy shirt, shoes you don\u2019t mind lingering in for an unhurried stroll. It\u2019s a good night to take the dog around the block, sort a drawer you\u2019ve been ignoring, or brew something warm and step onto the porch to listen to the neighborhood quiet itself. If you need an errand, pick the nearby one and keep it brief; otherwise let the evening breathe a little, the sky mottled and companionable above you.",
