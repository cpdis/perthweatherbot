    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the lingering chill hints at the approaching dawn. Presently, the skies offer a mostly clear expanse, winking down upon the cityscape, with a low temperature lingering around 46 degrees. A gentle northwestern breeze whispers through the streets, bringing a slight rustle of leaves, while gusts flirt with the rooftops. The absence of the notorious fog allows the lights of the Bay to shine unobstructed, illuminating the landscape with a dim, ethereal glow.\n\nTomorrow, Christmas Day promises a refreshing sunlit experience. The forecast predicts a gentle rise towards a high of 55 degrees, tapering off to a cooler 53 as the afternoon unfolds. While the northwest winds remain mild, the day\u2019s warmth will beckon residents to embrace the outdoors. Dressing in layers would be wise, perhaps a light sweater with a jacket readily accessible for when the warmth of the sun gives way to the cool evening air. This is a fine opportunity for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the charm of the city shines in its festive spirit, or perhaps an outing to one of the local cafes, where the inviting warmth of good coffee and cheerful ambiance can be savored. Embrace the day, as it unfolds with a gentle grace, promising memories under the vast, clear sky.",
