The cool air, kissing the skin at around 42 degrees, hints at a night that will be brisk yet beautiful. A gentle North wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the promise of a crystalline morning to follow. The absence of fog tonight allows the twinkling lights of the city to dance freely, unencumbered by the usual mist that so often rolls in from the bay, ensuring that the Golden Gate remains a majestic silhouette against the night.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the sun will grace us with its presence, bringing a sunny day that warms to a pleasant 57 degrees. As the afternoon approaches, temperatures will gently dip to a refreshing 55. The breeze will maintain its lightness, caressing the skin in a delightful manner, perfect for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while soaking up the sun\u2019s rays. Dress warmly yet comfortably\u2014a light jacket to stave off the evening chill, and perhaps a cozy scarf to enhance the experience. Whether you choose to wander through the streets or find a quiet nook to reflect, this time in San Francisco offers a serene retreat from the clamor of everyday life.",
