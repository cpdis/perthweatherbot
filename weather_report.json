    "weather_report": "As midnight fades and the clock inches toward dawn, the air in Downtown San Francisco carries the weight of impending rain, a shroud of clouds enveloping the city with palpable expectation. With temperatures hovering in the low 50s, a brisk southeast wind rustles the stillness, weaving through the streets like whispered secrets. The promise of rain hangs thick\u2014every sidewalk glimmers, waiting to drink in the new layers of moisture that will soon spill from the sky. Mists linger, hinting at the marine layer creeping in from the coast, lending an otherworldly softness to the skyline as it merges with the softly muted hues of the city.\n\nAs day breaks, the drizzle will intensify, painting everything in somber yet invigorating shades of gray. A high near 59 is a modest offering for those worn down by the damp coolness, a nearby reminder to dress warmly\u2014perhaps a thick sweater and a waterproof layer for good measure. While the streets may not beckon for leisurely strolls or sunlit outings, a cozy caf\u00e9 with hot beverages awaits. It\u2019s a day to savor the warmth of a favorite nook, to watch the world bustle under the weight of the clouds, and to relish the sound of rain tapping against glass. These are the moments that make the city pulse with life, even as the weather conspired to keep it subdued.",
