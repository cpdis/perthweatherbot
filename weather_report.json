    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a thick curtain of moisture drapes the skyline, heralding the rain forecast before dawn. The day has worn a veil of clouds, leaving a sense of intimacy in the air, the humidity wrapping around the city like a warm embrace. The breeze rises from the southwest, whispering between buildings, occasionally bursting into lively gusts that dance with the leaves. Tonight\u2019s low will hover gently, nudging past the comforting threshold of fifty degrees, adding layers of stillness to the night.\n\nTomorrow promises a contrast\u2014sunshine liberating the dampness of the previous night, casting glimmers upon the waterfront and illuminating the city's iconic vistas. A high of sixty-two beckons a fresh start, inviting the residents to shed the gloomy canvas of rain in favor of brighter hues. As the day evolves, one might consider donning a light jacket, perhaps layered with a favorite sweater, fitting for the delicate interplay of warmth and a breeze that may still carry a hint of chill. The aftermath of tonight\u2019s precipitation paints a perfect scene for a thoughtful stroll through the Embarcadero, where the reflections of muted city lights on wet pavement provide a serene backdrop for evening contemplation.",
