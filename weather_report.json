    "weather_report": "Today unfolds in Downtown San Francisco under a gentle sun that stretches above, casting soft light on the city's iconic skyline. As the morning progresses, temperatures will hover around a mild 67 degrees but will gradually descend to a cooler 64, inviting a quiet afternoon of comfortable strolling. Though the northwest wind, a whispering breeze at 2 to 15 mph, brings a refreshing touch, tonight that wind will strengthen, gusting up to 43 mph. The pleasant clarity of the day provides an enchanting backdrop for outdoor activities, but the setting sun will fade into a mostly clear night, with temperatures shifting to a cooler 56.\n\nWith the absence of fog today, one can breathe in the crisp air and appreciate the stunning vistas. A light sweater or a jacket might add a layer of comfort as the day transitions into night when the wind picks up and the chill sets in. It\u2019s an ideal day for enjoying a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping at a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or simply watching the city as it prepares for the evening's embrace. Engaging in simple activities, like browsing the local shops or finding a quiet spot in one of the city's quaint parks, offers a chance to savor the serene beauty of the day.",
