    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Bend comes on with a soft, wintry hush; clouds drift in and break apart like pages turning, leaving pieces of sky between them. The sun is already falling out of the picture, so don\u2019t expect much brightness now, and the UV will be negligible\u2014more candlelight than spotlight. Early evening looks mostly broken with gray and blue mingling overhead, easing toward scattered clouds by late evening, which should lend the night a cleaner, crisper clarity and the occasional star.\n\nIt\u2019s a night for warmth you can trust: a heavier coat, a scarf that doesn\u2019t fuss, gloves you won\u2019t regret carrying. The air will feel bracing, but not unfriendly. A slow walk before dinner, a short errand across town, or a quiet loop through the neighborhood would suit the mood; later, when the sky loosens, step outside for a minute to breathe and look up. Indoors, think simple comforts\u2014soup on the stove, a letter half-finished, a stack of mail tamed at the kitchen table\u2014while the clouds mind their own business and move along.",
