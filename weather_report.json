    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air is imbued with a persistent cloudiness, hinting at the slight chance of rain that had been predicted earlier. The temperatures hover coolly around fifty-two degrees, inviting people to pull their sweaters a bit tighter against the light southwest breeze that whispers around them. Although the forecast hints at potential rain showers, the night feels calmer, with the promise of little more than a sprinkling of moisture\u2014enough to make the streets shine softly under the amber glow of streetlights.\n\nTomorrow transitions with the likely embrace of rain showers, blending moments of sun amidst the gathering clouds. As the day reaches for a high around sixty, one will notice a gradual cooling in the afternoon, drawing down to about fifty-five. It would be prudent to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a waterproof jacket over a comfortable sweater\u2014preparing for both the warmth of sunlight and the inevitable chill that comes with maritime breezes. While the scene this evening captures the city's stunning silhouette against a dimming sky, tomorrow may beckon with opportunities for strolls along the waterfront, a quiet museum visit, or sipping coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9 while the world outside dances with raindrops.",
