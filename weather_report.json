    "weather_report": "As the clock gently ticks past midnight, Downtown San Francisco finds itself in a tranquil embrace of subdued light and cool breezes. The overnight hours bring a whisper of rain, a mere hint before dawn, as the clouds drift lazily across the heavens, leaving behind a slightly dampened atmosphere. With temperatures hovering in the upper forties, the air feels crisp against the skin, stirred by a west-northwest wind that carries the coastal essence of the Bay Area. The likelihood of precipitation holds at 20%, offering a flicker of uncertainty, like the fleeting shadows of a passing fog.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the forecast presents a welcome contrast; the sun will emerge tomorrow, casting golden rays across a crisp blue canvas. Temperatures will peak around sixty, before gently retreating to the mid-fifties, a mild invitation to venture outdoors. Dressing in layers is wise\u2014perhaps a light sweater and a windbreaker, perfect for the morning chill yet comfortable enough for the sun's embrace later in the day. The pleasantness of the sun-soaked afternoon beckons one to stroll along the waterfront or enjoy a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh pastries mingles with the fresh sea air. While the marine layer may cling to the edges of the Golden Gate at times, here in the heart of the city, clarity reigns, revealing the stunning urban landscape below, punctuated by the iconic silhouettes of its storied landmarks.",
