    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sky unfolds in a brilliant expanse of blue, unmarred by fog or the slightest hint of moisture. It is as if the bay itself has taken a deep exhale, offering a clarity that reveals the stunning vistas of the city and the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge against the horizon. Temperatures hover close to 60 degrees, a gentle reminder of winter's presence, yet the afternoon will usher in a subtle chill as it dips slightly. The north wind teases playfully at six miles per hour, a whisper among the hum of the bustling city below.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky promises to remain clear, with temperatures settling into the cool embrace of the mid-forties. Such splendid weather invites one to slip into layers\u2014a light sweater or a chic jacket to navigate the gentle evening breeze\u2014paired with comfortable shoes for strolling along the waterfront or maybe a leisurely walk through the quaint streets of the Mission District, where colorful murals narrate stories of the city\u2019s history. Perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 awaits, where a warm drink can accompany reflections of a day well spent, with horizons filled with golden light giving way to the more intimate evening hues.",
