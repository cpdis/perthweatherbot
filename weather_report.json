    "weather_report": "Under the shifting skies of Subiaco, the day unfolds with a somber shade of moderate rain. By early afternoon, the dampened streets of this charming town resonate with the subdued percussion of raindrops, creating a melancholic yet rhythmic overture to your day. As the clock strikes past two, the rain promises no reprieve, making light scarce and the horizon a blur of muted hues. The air grows dense with moisture, lending a quiet intimacy to the surroundings, as if the world has been wrapped in a soft-focus lens. On such a day, sunlight remains a distant fantasy, and the UV index hides in the shadows, leaving you to embrace the coziness of indoor warmth.\n\nDress with intention: layers and waterproof gear shall be your allies, allowing you to navigate the day\u2019s watery whims with comfort and practicality. Consider activities that respect the weather\u2019s temperament\u2014a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the pitter-patter outside; or perhaps a leisurely amble through the town\u2019s galleries, where art offers an escape and musings in equal measure. The landscape today is best enjoyed in glimpses through rain-speckled windows, where the outdoors appears more like a watercolor painting than a destination. Under the canopy of persistent clouds, allow yourself to surrender to the enforced tranquility, finding beauty in the play of light and shadow behind the rolling curtains of rain.",
