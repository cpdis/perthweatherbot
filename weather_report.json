    "weather_report": "The night drapes Downtown San Francisco in a serene hush, with mostly clear skies allowing the city lights to sparkle like scattered jewels against the dark canvas of the night. As the cool air settles in, the temperature hovers around the low forties, complemented by a gentle north-northwest breeze that whispers through the streets. For those venturing out into this calm, a light jacket paired with layers will offer both comfort and warmth, perfect for strolling through the quiet avenues or perhaps pausing to take in the distant shimmer of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the city will awaken to vibrant sunshine, illuminating the skyline with a radiant clarity. The expected high will reach into the mild fifties, creating a pleasant environment devoid of fog, with only the softest marine layer possibly basking in the morning sun. It's an excellent day to engage in leisurely activities\u2014consider a meandering walk along the waterfront, or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 where one can sip a warm drink while observing the daily rhythm of life awaken around them. Embrace the day with simple pleasures, allowing the charm of San Francisco to unfurl gently with each moment.",
