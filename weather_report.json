    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches over Downtown San Francisco, a soft drizzle whispers against windowpanes, hinting at the night's rain that is soon to give way to a more hopeful morning. The temperature hovers around a cool 53 degrees, gradually rising to a mild 62 as the sun begins its ascent. For now, the city is blanketed in mostly cloudy skies, with remnants of a marine layer clinging to the recognizable outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the hills beyond. The westerly winds stir gently, moving at around 8 mph, while an 80% chance of precipitation lingers until the early hours fade.\n\nAs Saturday unfolds, the promise of sunshine beckons, though a slight chance of lingering drizzle remains until mid-morning. By afternoon, expect the clouds to part, revealing a clear blue expanse, perfect for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a stop at a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth of freshly brewed coffee can compete with the rising temperatures. With the pleasant sun peeking through and a gentle breeze, dressing in layers will serve you well today: a light jacket over a comfortable sweater, and perhaps a scarf for those cool drafts that tend to roll in unexpectedly. Today is ideal for appreciating the small moments, whether it be a quiet walk in the park or browsing artisanal shops, and finding joy in a city that never ceases to inspire.",
