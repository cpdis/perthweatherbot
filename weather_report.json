    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a serene night: the last smudges of afternoon cloud gave way to a clean, transparent sky, and the air now feels calm and gently cooling. Sunshine was generous earlier, with a lively UV bite through midafternoon, but the UV is negligible now; the clarity tonight is striking, the kind that makes distant lights look a touch nearer. It\u2019s the sort of evening that asks for unhurried breaths and unforced plans.\n\nExpect the night to remain clear and quiet, pleasant rather than chilly, with a slow drift toward cooler hours. Light layers are sensible\u2014something you can shrug on and off without thinking: a soft shirt, a cardigan in your bag. This is good weather for a small errand after dinner, a short amble around the block, watering the plants on the balcony, or folding the day\u2019s laundry by an open window while the crickets keep time. If you\u2019re staying in, crack a window, make a cup of tea, and read a few pages before the week resumes its steady rhythm.",
