    "weather_report": "Past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is a patchwork of broken cloud, the moon slipping in and out like a shy conspirator. The air feels mild and a touch hushed; streetlights pool on dampened pavement and the night has that softened clarity that keeps sounds close. It isn\u2019t a star-gazer\u2019s night, but it is gentle enough for a last cup of tea by an open window, or a quiet page or two before sleep.\n\nToward dawn, expect the same mottled cover to linger, giving a muted sunrise and a day that begins with filtered light. Sunshine should come in intervals rather than a blaze, which makes the morning pleasant for errands on foot or an easy ride to the shops; if the cloud hangs about, the glare stays kind. UV is negligible now, but it rises quickly after breakfast this time of year, even with passing cloud, so plan a hat and sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out through late morning. A light layer suits the early hours, with breathable clothes for the day. Consider an early coffee on the veranda, a brisk pre-breakfast walk when the streets are still yawning, or a tidy-up indoors while the sky makes up its mind.",
