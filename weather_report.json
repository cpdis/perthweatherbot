    "weather_report": "City Beach eases into night under a mostly open sky, just a few thin clouds idling by. The afternoon kept a gentle sun that slipped between those light veils, so the day felt bright without glare and the horizon stayed crisp. Now the UV has ebbed to nothing and the light turns velvet, the air easy on the skin and clear enough to make details pop in the half-dark. It has been a clean, well-lit sort of day, unhurried and kind.\n\nThe rest of the night looks steady and quiet with only passing cloud, pleasant for small, ordinary rituals. Wear a light layer or a windbreaker if you linger by the water, soft shoes for an unhurried stroll, and pockets for cool hands. Consider a slow walk to hear the surf\u2019s soft metronome, a gentle spin on the bike path, or an open window while you sort a drawer and let the salt air do its work. Sunscreen can wait until morning; tonight belongs to cotton, calm, and the simple company of the breeze.",
