    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfurls with a splendid embrace of sunshine, caressing the cool air that fills the streets as daylight wanes. The high temperature hovers around a refreshing 63 degrees, gradually retreating to a gentle 60 as the sun begins its descent. A soft north wind whispers through the alleyways, inviting locals to shed their winter layers for lighter garb, perhaps a cozy sweater paired with a light jacket for the evening chill that promises a serene dip to 46 degrees.\n\nThe clarity today is notably striking, painting the city in vibrant hues. While hints of fog may linger just beyond the Golden Gate Bridge, obscuring the vast ocean, the immediate vista sparkles with crystal clear visibility. With the warmth of the sun still lingering, the backdrop offers a perfect moment to explore the local cafes or take a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sights and sounds of the city meld harmoniously as the day slips into twilight. As the evening progresses, the forecast points to a clear sky, ideal for a reflective evening walk or perhaps a quiet dinner at a cherished bistro, listening as the city settles into its nocturnal rhythm.",
