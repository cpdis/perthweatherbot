    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into the small hours under a mostly clear sky, the night crisp and still, with stars unblinking above rooftops. Toward dawn, a quilt of broken cloud is likely to drift in, muting first light rather than smothering it. Expect a day that leans bright, with sunshine slipping between patches of cloud; visibility should be clean, the air feeling tidy and well-swept. The sun will bite once it\u2019s up, and the UV will ramp quickly through the morning to the kind of spring strength that demands respect, even when the breeze feels civilized.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant one if you pace it. For the early riser, a quiet walk or a gentle spin to the bakery suits the soft sky; a light layer will keep the edge off the pre-dawn cool. As the day opens, think breathable fabrics, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; long sleeves if you plan to linger outdoors around lunch, when the UV becomes bossy. Consider errands or a bit of garden puttering early, then a coffee on a shaded terrace or a visit to a gallery while the sun grows fierce, and an amble through Kings Park later when the light turns honeyed and kinder.",
