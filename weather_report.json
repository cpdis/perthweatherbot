    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the atmosphere hangs thick with a muted charm, as warm hues are swallowed by a gray veil. The sun, attempting to break through the clouds, graces the city with a touch of brightness, yet the chill seeps through, ushering in a high that barely whispers near fifty-three degrees. As the day moves toward dusk, the clouds will deepen; rain begins to make its presence felt around ten, creeping in with the evening. Temperatures will subtly rise, settling around the forty-nine mark as a gentle south-southwest breeze sways the branches. \n\nVisibility seems shrouded, the marine layer effectively cloaking the iconic vistas of the Golden Gate. One can sense the early signs of rain gathering, a reminder of the dynamic weather typical of this coastal city. For those stepping out, layers will be your ally\u2014perhaps a light raincoat over a warm sweater, softening the bite of the wind. It\u2019s a fitting afternoon for leisurely pursuits: a cozy caf\u00e9 with warm drinks offers solace, or a stroll through one of the nearby parks could be refreshed by the scent of impending rain. Embrace the subdued beauty of the day, finding comfort in its quietude before the downpour arrives.",
