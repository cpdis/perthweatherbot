With a low temperature settling around 46 degrees, the night is cool but refreshingly crisp, the gentle north winds whispering through the streets. Tomorrow, as dawn breaks, expect the sun to cast its warm glow across the vibrant skyline, inviting a daytime high that dances near 59 degrees, gently tapering off to about 56 in the afternoon. \n\nThe atmosphere is notably free of fog, yet the patchwork of light hints at a serene calmness, perhaps a brief marine layer lingering at bay, its presence felt rather than seen. It is a perfect opportunity to don layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a comfortable t-shirt, perfect for enjoying a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or sipping a warm beverage at an outdoor caf\u00e9 while gazing upon the water. Such conditions call for quiet reflection or simple pleasures; perhaps a stroll to wander the streets, noticing the rich tapestry of life unfolding at night, or finding solace in the arts at a nearby gallery. Tonight whispers of tranquility, wrapped in the cool embrace of a San Francisco night.",
