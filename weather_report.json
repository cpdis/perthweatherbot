    "weather_report": "Dallas wakes under a quilt of broken clouds, the sun slipping in and out like a shy performer between curtains. The light is soft and silvery this morning, more glow than glare; UV remains low, with only a modest nudge upward near midday. The air feels steady and uncomplicated, the day likely to stay partly cloudy rather than brilliantly clear, offering moments of brightness without the harshness of summer.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for gentle layers: long sleeves with a light jacket, comfortable shoes, sunglasses if you\u2019re out around lunch, and a dab of sunscreen if you linger. It looks pleasant in that quiet December way\u2014dry, calm, and forgiving\u2014good for a late-morning walk with coffee, a run of errands, or unhurried browsing at a market or bookstore. If you\u2019ve chores to tackle, the tempered light will be kind; if you prefer to linger indoors, a window seat will do the rest.",
