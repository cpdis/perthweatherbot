    "weather_report": "Subiaco\u2019s midday wears a clear, polished sky; light spills across verandas and pavements with a clean, uncomplicated brightness. The sun has some bite now, with the UV running high through early afternoon before easing toward evening, so a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen are wise companions. The air feels dry and honest, visibility is sharp, and the day reads beautifully simple: blue above, steady beneath.\n\nExpect this clarity to hold through the late afternoon, with a gentler edge as a light sea breeze noses inland. It\u2019s a pleasant window for unhurried errands on foot, a quiet browse at the library, or a coffee taken in the shade where you can watch the afternoon lengthen. Dress in light layers or a short-sleeve shirt, and keep something to throw over your shoulders for after sunset when it cools. If the washing basket is full, the line will reward you; if the garden is calling, the light is kind and the hours are forgiving.",
