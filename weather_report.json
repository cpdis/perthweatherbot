    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Subiaco, the streets are hushed and the sky is mostly open, with only a few stray clouds sliding past like slow boats on a dark river. The air feels gentle and uncomplicated, the kind that invites a quiet breath by the window before turning in. Toward dawn those clouds should thin away, and the morning looks set to arrive clean and clear, the light sharpening edges on rooftops and jacarandas.\n\nExpect a bright, sun-forward day once the sun is up; in this season the UV rises fast, pushing from mild early rays to a fierce glare by late morning, so a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen will serve you well. Start with a light layer for the early cool, then shift to breathable clothes as the day warms. It\u2019s a good morning for small, ordinary pleasures: a brisk walk to fetch bread, watering the garden before the heat, or hanging the wash early so it dries without fuss. By midday, shade is your friend; save errands for the shoulder hours when the light softens again.",
