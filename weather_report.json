    "weather_report": "As the hands of the clock mark half-past two in Subiaco, the wee hours maintain the picturesque dance of scattered clouds adorning the sky, artistically veiling the moon and stars. The day has just begun, yet it softly whispers tales of tranquility and serenity prevalent in the surroundings. Exquisite and light, it is just enough to escape the naked eye but dense enough to prepare Subiaco for a day that promises the tender comfort of a cloud-kissed spectacle. \n\nAs the whispers of the wind blend with the symphony of early daylight, Subiaco prepares to embrace another day that is neither too bright nor gloomy, pleasant indeed. Today, the kind of day when a light overcoat offers the perfect companionship, and sunglasses lie in wait, unsure if they would grace the day. A perfect setting for a comfortable stroll to the bakery or enjoy a steaming cup of coffee by the window, lost in the pages of your favorite novel. It's a chance to embrace the soft hues of an overcast day, a hint of the impending spring waiting to unfurl. Take this opportunity to revel in nature's soft pauses, and appreciate the elegant beauty of scattered clouds, like a well-thrown, deliberate dash of white paint on a never-ending canvas of blue.",
