    "weather_report": "As dusk descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the remnants of a partly sunny Christmas Day give way to the anticipation of evening showers. The air carries a hint of moisture, suggesting that the lovely afternoon light has already begun to fade, making way for the more subdued tones of an overcast sky. With temperatures dropping to a cozy 50 degrees, the transitioning breeze gently whispers from the south at about 5 to 13 mph, an invitation to grab a light jacket as you head out.\n\nThe cityscape, adorned with the glow of scattered lights, forms a quiet backdrop for a relaxed evening. Expect some rain starting after 10 PM, with a likelihood of scattered droplets across the sidewalks, so it would be wise to grab an umbrella for your stroll. Given the forecast's indication of an 80% chance of precipitation later, it's a good time to find yourself in a snug spot\u2014perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 where one can sip a warm drink while watching the world glide by. If you're venturing out, embrace the layers, allowing yourself the comfort of warmth as the marine layer begins to cloak the horizon. Tonight, let the soothing sounds of the city embrace you while you enjoy this peaceful Christmas evening.",
