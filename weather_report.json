    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a lucid night: the sky is clear and polished, the air steady, and the edges of the town feel quietly defined. This afternoon and early evening kept to the same cloudless script, bright and unfiltered; the sun had a firm hand and the UV would have bitten at midday, but now it has softened to nothing. The clarity is set to persist into the late hours.\n\nIt feels pleasantly simple rather than dramatic. A light layer or soft sweater suits after dark; by day, reach for sunglasses, a brim, and a touch of sunscreen. These are conditions for modest comforts and errands done without hurry: a gentle walk to drop a note in the post, a few minutes on the balcony while the kettle hums, or giving the plants a quiet drink before turning in.",
