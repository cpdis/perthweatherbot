    "weather_report": "As the morning stretches into East Fremantle, the soft patter of recent light rain whispers through the still air, leaving the earth refreshed and the leaves glistening with gentle droplets. The clouds hang low, casting a cool, muted light over the town, hinting at a day that may play hide and seek with the sun. An umbrella, for those venturing out early, might remain a wise companion, though the rain seems shy and retiring now. Any patches of blue sky are likely to be intrusions rather than fixtures in the day's diorama, as the moisture in the air marries a tempered breeze that suggests a modest sweater might be more prudent than bare sleeves. \n\nThis is a day that invites quiet reflection in the comfort of a sheltered bench or a slow promenade beside the Swan River, where the ripples mirror the overcast sky's embrace. The muted colors of the landscape blend seamlessly with the air, lending a tranquil backdrop to leisurely pursuits\u2014be it indulging in a cherished novel, pondering thoughts beside a warming cup of coffee, or meandering through market stalls accompanied by the gentle symphony of raindrops. Though the sun plays coy, perhaps offering only glimpses, the air carries a calm that invites East Fremantle\u2019s folks to savor the peace nestled within this tenderly overcast day.",
