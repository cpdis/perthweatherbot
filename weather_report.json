    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the landscape enjoys a refreshing embrace of sunlit clarity. With temperatures meandering around 62 degrees, a gentle west wind plays among the streets, encouraging a leisurely afternoon stroll. The air is free of the heavy marine layer typically draping the Bay, revealing a vibrant panorama that stretches towards the Golden Gate. Tonight, the sky will largely remain clear, giving way to a serene evening with a low around 49, the soft whisper of a south wind accompanying the fading light.\n\nAs you step outside, consider a light jacket, which will keep you snug without detracting from the pleasantness of the day. The warmth of the sun has infused the air with a crispness, perfect for a brief caf\u00e9 visit or an unhurried walk through the idyllic streets. With the delightful visibility, perhaps take a moment to pause at a viewpoint, allowing the beauty of the moment to wash over you, far removed from the rush of urban life. Embrace the simplicity of the day, whether indulging in the city\u2019s culinary offerings or sipping a warm beverage as the evening unfolds, settling into a peaceful close.",
