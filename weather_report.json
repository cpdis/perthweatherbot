    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, with a gentle north wind adding a crisp touch to the air. As temperatures hover near the mid-50s, the vibrant cityscape is illuminated by the soft glow of sunlight, contrasting beautifully against the remnants of the morning fog that still clings to the outer edges of the bay. While the sharper outlines of the urban skyline rise proudly, hinting at a day filled with potential and promise, a delicate marine layer lingers near the water, leaving a hint of mystique in its wake.\n\nAs night approaches, clouds will begin to blanket the sky, inviting a drop in temperature to around the mid-40s. Embrace this transition with layered clothing\u2014perhaps a light sweater beneath a windbreaker to navigate both the chill of the setting sun and the cooler breeze that will accompany evening strolls. Given the serene yet slightly brisk conditions, a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9 could turn into an intimate engagement with the city. Enjoy a hot beverage while watching the world wind down, your surroundings imbued with the hazy beauty of the San Francisco evening.",
