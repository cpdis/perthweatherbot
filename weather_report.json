    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives under a soft, pewter sky, the light gentled as clouds thicken and the air takes on that faint, mineral smell that hints at rain. The sun is shy and filtered, but November\u2019s bite still lingers; UV can remain surprisingly assertive around lunch, even through a veil of cloud, so a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go amiss. The day feels calm rather than bright, with visibility good, the colour of the streets slightly desaturated as if someone turned down the contrast.\n\nFrom early afternoon into late day, passing light showers look likely, more a hush than a downpour, the kind that spots the pavement and cools the shoulders. It\u2019s a pleasant-enough day if you\u2019re dressed for it: breathable layers with a light waterproof or umbrella, comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind a sprinkle. Consider errands close to home, a quiet browse in the bookshop, or a caf\u00e9 window seat where you can watch the drizzle gather in the jacaranda petals. If you\u2019re stepping out for a stroll, keep it leisurely and aim for the gaps between showers; the evening should feel fresh, the kind that pairs well with a simple supper and an early night.",
