    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, a quilt of broken cloud hangs quietly over the suburbs, letting through only a pale hint of morning. The air feels gentle and a touch cool, the kind that makes the street sound softer and the first birds louder. It\u2019s not a pristine, glassy sky; more a muted canvas that will brighten slowly as the sun noses up.\n\nExpect a day of passing light and shadow, with the sun slipping in and out of cloud. Even so, once morning gets going the UV will rise quickly for this time of year, so plan on sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out for long. Light layers suit the early hours, easy to shed toward mid-morning. It looks like a pleasant, workable day: good for a short walk to fetch coffee, a gentle pedal to an errand, or opening the windows and letting the cooler air loiter while you read the news and get the day started.",
