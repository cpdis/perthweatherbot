    "weather_report": "The night sky over Downtown San Francisco is a serene canvas, with clear visibility offering a tranquil backdrop for the illuminated cityscape. Tonight\u2019s low is comfortable, hovering around 44 degrees, inviting the indigo chill that envelops the streets as the east-southeast winds whisper softly, adding a gentle touch to the evening air. There is no fog to shroud the city, allowing for splendid views of the surrounding hills and waterfront, where the flickering lights of the bay mirror the stars above.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, expect bright, sunny rays to awaken the city. The anticipated high near 59 means a cool, pleasant day ahead, perfect for light layers. Consider a well-fitted sweater or a light jacket to ward off the morning\u2019s coolness while embracing the warmth of the sun in the afternoon. The gentle north winds promise a refreshing breeze, complementing the daylight. Given the inviting conditions, a stroll along the waterfront, a leisurely coffee at a bistro, or even a wander through the nearby parks can be the perfect way to savor this urban oasis. In the midst of such clarity, the city beckons, offering simple pleasures against a backdrop of natural beauty and vibrant life.",
