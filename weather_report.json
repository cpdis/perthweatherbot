    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a clean, open sky and only a few clouds idling at the edges. The light is gone and with it the sting of the sun; UV is effectively nil now. The air feels uncomplicated and clear, the kind that lets sound travel and stars poke through between gentle veils of cloud.\n\nThrough the late hours, expect mostly fair conditions with scattered clouds drifting in at times, more decorative than disruptive. It should feel pleasant rather than brisk, the sort of night that calls for a light layer or a soft cardigan if you step outside. This is good weather for a slow circuit of the block to unwind, a quiet sit on the balcony with the lights low, or putting the house in order for tomorrow\u2014watering the plants, laying out what you\u2019ll need for the morning. If you\u2019re out, walking shoes and an easy pace fit the mood; if you\u2019re in, crack a window and let the night air tidy up the day.",
