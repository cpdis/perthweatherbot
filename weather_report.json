    "weather_report": "As evening gently unfolds over Subiaco, the remnants of the day's quiet showers linger in the cool, refreshing air. The light rain at lunchtime painted a borderless gray across the sky, lending an evocative atmosphere that feels just right for introspection, or perhaps a slow meander on dampened paths. At this hour, the rain has tapered off, leaving behind a soft, mist-laden whisper of moisture in the air. The clouds will likely hold firm through the night, warding off any notions of starlight or moon, and imparting a veil of gentle security. \n\nIt's the kind of evening best navigated in layers: a light sweater or a cozy jacket should suffice to ward off the evening's chill. The absence of a harsh sun means you can forego the usual accessories of summer - no need for sunglasses perched on your nose or the reassurance of sunblock. Instead, embrace the cozy allure of the evening indoors or an old haunt nearby. A steaming cup of tea or a good book will harmonize beautifully with today's tranquil aura. Given the day and time, consider revisiting a forgotten indoor hobby, or simply muse over the day's gentle patter in the company of an old friend.",
