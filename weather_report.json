    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, where the air carries a hint of warmth beneath the bright, almost cheerful sky. The sun shimmers defiantly against the grey whispers of clouds, making way for a brief respite before the anticipated rain. As the city stretches out below, one can see the gentle waver of the bay, a promise of the coming moisture, but for now, the brightness holds\u2014just enough to entice a stroll through the vibrant streets. Wind gusts, modest yet persistent, play around you, urging a light jacket to fend off the chill that lingers on the edges.\n\nHowever, as daylight begins to fold into evening, the landscape shifts. The clouds deepen to a foreboding grey, and the rain looms, a steadfast certainty lurking on the horizon. By night, expect the skies to yield, soaking the streets with generous showers. Prepare for the drop in temperature, wrapping yourself in a cozy layer to stave off the coolness that follows. As the rain begins its steady rhythm, consider embracing the indoor charm of a local caf\u00e9, perhaps curling up with a book or enjoying the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee\u2014a perfect antidote to the damp evening that awaits.",
