    "weather_report": "As daylight unfolds over downtown San Francisco, the city bathes in a gentle embrace of mostly sunny skies, the crisp air carrying a whisper of the North Northwest breeze. The temperature is poised near the mid-fifties, presenting an inviting canvas for the day's ventures. However, as the afternoon progresses, you may feel the chill creeping in, reminding you of the subtle dance between warmth and cool that defines this coastal haven. The morning light reveals a clarity that showcases the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge, its red spans resolutely cutting through the serene blue, while the distant hills stand watch like venerable sentinels.\n\nTonight, the calm will settle into a partly cloudy sky as the day yields to evening, with temperatures slipping into the soothing embrace of the low forties. A light west wind will accompany the nightfall, creating a perfect ambiance for those looking to savor the dusk. As you plan your attire, think comfort layered with warmth; a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perhaps complemented by a scarf, would be ideal for the evening's retreat. With such delightful conditions, a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely coffee in one of the city's charming caf\u00e9s would make for a tranquil afternoon, allowing you to absorb the picturesque that is uniquely San Francisco as the year draws to a close.",
