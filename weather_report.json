    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush: a clear, indigo sky lightening at the edges, the last stars stepping offstage. The air feels calm and clean, with a faint coolness that invites a quiet breath at the back door. In a little while the sun will roll in unimpeded and the world will sharpen, colors turning crisp and confident under a wide, polished dome.\n\nExpect a bright, cloudless day that grows assertively sunny; UV will ramp up quickly after breakfast, the kind that asks for a hat, sunglasses, and proper sunscreen if you plan to linger outdoors. Start with light layers for the early chill, then shift to breathable fabrics as the day warms. It\u2019s a good morning for a gentle walk at first light, a ride to work before the glare builds, or hanging a load of washing while the sky does the drying. Garden tasks are best tackled early and then surrendered to the shade; later, duck into the library, browse a bookshop, or knock over small errands in cool interiors. If you crave water, aim for a few laps at the local pool rather than baking on a deck. The day will be simple and lucid, and a little care with the sun will keep it pleasant.",
