    "weather_report": "In the soft, muted light of early morning, Downtown San Francisco awakens beneath a blanket of clouds, the air cool with a hint of moisture. At present, the city is enveloped in a patchy fog that lingers along the coast and creeps into the heart of the city, softening the outlines of familiar edifices. The temperatures hover around a refreshing 48 degrees, inviting a light yet warm layer to ward off the chill. As the day progresses, expect the fog to gradually dissipate, giving way to moments of sunlight that prickle through the clouds, with highs nearing 58 before retreating slightly by afternoon.\n\nAs one navigates the streets, it's prudent to don a versatile attire\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a long-sleeved shirt, ready for the wayward breezes that accompany the gentle north wind. Given the temperate climate, this brisk morning presents opportunities for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or a moment spent savoring coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, as you watch the city come alive. For those inclined to wield a camera, the inviting light in the later hours may turn the ordinary into the extraordinary against the backdrop of San Francisco's shifting skyline.",
