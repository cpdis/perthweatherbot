    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a pale, amiable sun, the morning light washing through a loose quilt of cloud. As the day leans past late morning, expect the sky to drift from scattered to more broken cloud, softening the glare without stealing the warmth. It looks like a dry, serviceable day: bright but not crystal, the horizon a touch gauzy. Even with the cloud, the UV will be strong to very strong around midday, so think sunglasses, sunscreen, and a brim that casts its own small shade.\n\nIt\u2019s pleasant enough to be out and about without fuss. Dress light and breathable, add a light layer for indoor air-conditioning. A walk for coffee, a gentle errand loop, or a quiet turn through the park will suit the temperament of the day; if you\u2019re pottering in the garden, keep to the shade in the early afternoon. By midafternoon the cloud may tatter and thicken in patches, but the mood remains steady and unhurried, the kind of weather that gets along with you.",
