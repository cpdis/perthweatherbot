    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco arrives under a soft lid of cloud, the sun a shy rumor behind a seamless grey. The light is gentle and even, giving the streets a quiet, matte sheen and taking the glare out of the day. Forecasts keep the blanket on through late morning and into the afternoon, so don\u2019t expect much sparkle; UV looks muted by the overcast, low to moderate at most, though a dab of sunscreen at midday never hurts. The air feels settled and the horizon is smudged rather than sharp, a day for unrushed errands and small comforts.\n\nDress in light layers: a breathable long-sleeve or a thin jacket, sunglasses optional, hat if you\u2019re sensitive. The flat light is kind to wandering and to chores\u2014good for a brisk loop around the block, a relaxed grocery run, or a quiet hour by a caf\u00e9 window with the to-do list. If you\u2019re inclined, this is fine weather for a tidy-up at home or a short, steady pedal to nowhere in particular.",
