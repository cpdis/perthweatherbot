The forecast hints at a slight chance of rain, with the clouds hanging just low enough to whisper of moisture. Tonight\u2019s low, languishing around the mid-40s, pairs with an east-northeast breeze that carries only the softest gusts, suggesting a firm but gentle touch on the skin. The cityscape, muted yet robust, reflects this transitional phase of the day; partially cloaked in clouds, the skyline is both enigmatic and inviting.\n\nSunday promises a continuation of this gentle dance between sun and cloud, with a hint of warmth, reaching near 56 in the afternoon. The potential for early rain often sparks a certain expectation, yet, as the day unfolds, a better chance of sunshine arises, mingling with the remnants of the marine layer nestled around the Golden Gate. Residents are encouraged to dress in layers, perhaps donning a light jacket to ward off the chill but keeping a cozy sweater handy for a stroll through the city's lively streets or a quiet corner of a local caf\u00e9. As the week begins, a pleasant afternoon beckons\u2014a perfect time to meander along the waterfront or indulge in the art of people-watching amidst the soft hum of the city, where life moves both gracefully and steadily.",
