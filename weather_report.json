    "weather_report": "The morning sun struggles to break through a quilt of clouds hanging over Downtown San Francisco, casting a soft, muted light over the city's familiar features. A gentle rustle of the northeast wind brings a cool touch to the air, hinting at rain that threatens to fall but hasn't quite made its presence known yet. With temperatures hovering around the low fifties, there's a palpable chill that nudges one toward a cozy jacket or a light sweater\u2014preferably layered, as the day\u2019s forecast suggests temperatures will dip slightly as the afternoon unfolds.\n\nAs you wander the streets, it's best to embrace a pragmatic approach. The clouds may not promise a deluge, but the resident marine layer dances just out of sight, making the hills and bay mysterious and ethereal. If the rain begins to fall, shelter can be found in one of the cozy cafes that dot the urban landscape, where a hot beverage can warm your hands and spirit. Perhaps a leisurely stroll through one of the quieter parks would provide solace amidst the city's rhythm, with just enough motion to invigorate while basking in the atmospheric embrace. All in all, today is a gentle reminder that even the briskest of days can hold a touch of beauty.",
