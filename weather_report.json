    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco opens under a polished blue, the kind of clear sky that sharpens edges and coaxes everything into crisp relief. With the day already bright and set to stay cloudless into early afternoon, expect strong, unfiltered sunshine and a UV bite that grows fierce around midday. The air reads as uncomplicated and clean, a day made for light and shadow rather than drama, and the horizon looks steady as a held breath.\n\nDress simply and sensibly: a breezy shirt, breathable trousers or a sundress, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses with real backbone, and a confident layer of sunscreen. Carry water. If you\u2019re out before lunch, enjoy a gentle errand on foot or a quiet coffee by a window; later, choose shaded paths, a library nook, or an unhurried browse through the shops. It\u2019s a pleasant day if you give the sun its space, moving from patch to patch of shade like a cat with good instincts.",
