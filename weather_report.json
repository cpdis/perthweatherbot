    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Perth arrives with an unblemished sky and warm, honeyed light sliding across verandas and footpaths. The forecast keeps it simple: clear now and staying clear into the evening. Sunlight remains bright but softening at this hour, the UV index already trending down; still, if you\u2019re out before dusk, a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen are sensible. The clarity is high, edges crisp, and the air feels easy; as the sun drops, expect a gentle cool-down that calls for a light layer over breathable clothing.\n\nFor plans, think small and pleasant: a quiet stroll to watch the color fade, a tidy-up in the garden while there\u2019s still light, a calm ride to the shops, or a sit-down on the balcony with something refreshing, letting the day unspool without hurry. It\u2019s an unfussy, cheerful evening, made for unambitious errands and easy company.",
