    "weather_report": "As the clock has passed midnight and settled into the early hours of the new day, Subiaco finds itself cloaked under a tapestry of broken clouds, hinting at a sky that flirts with the soft glow of the moonlight dancing through the cotton-like patches. There's a sense of calm and promise in the air, caressed by the mild caress of cooler night breezes whispering stories of the dawn that approaches. The few clouds earlier have grown to a more generous scattering, creating a sense of anticipation for the day to come. In a town nestled amidst hills and charming streets, the atmosphere is reflective, almost meditative, as if the world has slowed down for a quiet contemplation.\n\nThe morning, wrapped in this symphony of broken clouds, offers an embrace that is cool and gentle, teasing the possibility of a sunlight-streaked afternoon yet does not forebode any undue heat. For those contemplating attire, layers will be your best friend - a lightweight jacket or a chic cardigan should suffice until the sun decides to assert itself, even if only a little. Today beckons with an understated elegance, perfect for strolling down memory-laden avenues or enjoying a leisurely breakfast at a quaint caf\u00e9, warmed by the aromatic promise of freshly brewed coffee. The day welcomes you to embark on simple pleasures: a morning spent sifting through old books at your favorite haunt or enjoying a slow walk in the park, perhaps accompanied by a curious dog or a good-humored squirrel eyeing you from its vantage perch. The world seems to whisper, not shout, nudging you gently into the tapestry of another day.",
