    "weather_report": "As the darkness of night lingers over Downtown San Francisco, the city holds its breath in a tranquil stillness. The sky is pristine and clear, a promise of tomorrow's sun. With the temperature beginning its slow ascent to the crispness of morning, there's a gentle north wind that caresses the air, barely stirring but lending a fresh hint of the outdoors. By dawn, the brightening horizon will transform into a spectacle of sunshine, soft and inviting, as the day promises to be bright with a high near sixty. \n\nAs the sun fully rises above the iconic skyline, it will sweep away the tendrils of any remaining fog, leaving a landscape bathed in an invigorating light. The breezy west-northwest winds will refresh the spirit, while the afternoon will see temperatures ease into a cooler embrace, around fifty-five, urging a light sweater or a stylish layer. This is a day to bask in, meandering through the alleys of Coit Tower or sipping coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, enjoying the stark beauty of the city. Perhaps a stroll along the waterfront at Pier 7 will inspire, the waves whispering secrets of the bay as the urban life hums gently around.",
