    "weather_report": "Before dawn the island sits under a soft drum of light rain, the kind that slicks the jetty timbers and hushes the gulls. Low cloud presses in and the horizon looks smudged, so expect a grey start with showers around dawn and into the morning. Sunshine will be scarce at first; any breaks will be brief and diluted, giving a pearly glow more than a blaze. UV is low in these early hours, but if the cloud thins later it can ramp up quickly in spring, so carry sunscreen even if the sky feels reluctant.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for practicality over bravado: a light waterproof over a breathable layer, shorts or quick-dry trousers, and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. It won\u2019t be harsh, just damp and a touch chilly in the breeze, quietly pleasant if you like the island in a reflective mood. Start with a slow coffee near the settlement while the showers loiter, then wander the sheltered paths or the museum when the rain thickens. If the drizzle slackens, an unhurried cycle to a windward cove can be lovely, the sea pewter and calm, though rocks will be slick. Keep plans flexible, pockets zipped, and eyes open for that fleeting pane of light when the clouds briefly remember how to part.",
