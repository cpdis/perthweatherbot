    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean, generous sky, the kind that makes colors feel truer. It\u2019s mid-morning and the light already has a gentle insistence, with only a few small clouds wandering about and little to impede the view. The day is set to stay clear and bright into early afternoon, with sunshine doing most of the talking and only brief brushstrokes of cloud. At this time of year the UV climbs fast; by midday it is likely very high, so shade, sunscreen, and dark lenses are wise companions.\n\nExpect a warm tilt as the hours unspool, pleasant if you keep to the breeze and take your time. Dress light and breathable, a brimmed hat if you\u2019re out, and carry water without making a production of it. It\u2019s a good day for simple errands on foot, a quiet coffee on a shaded veranda, a short ride to the markets, or tending the garden before the sun leans hard overhead. Later, drift back outside when the light softens and the pavements lose their glare.",
