    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds beneath a mostly sunny sky, where a delicate veil of fog clings softly to the hills and edges of the city, primarily in the distance near the Golden Gate. Despite the cool temperatures\u2014hovering just above fifty\u2014the sun offers a gentle warmth that beckons one to step outside. The clarity is refreshing, allowing for vivid views of the urban landscape, though wisps of marine layer linger around the coastline, a reminder of the ocean's embrace. \n\nAs the day progresses, expect temperatures to stabilize around fifty-eight, before subtly dipping into the mid-fifties in the afternoon. A light north-northwest wind will caress your skin, inviting layers that provide comfort without burden\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a jacket that you won\u2019t mind shedding as the sun stretches overhead. This is an ideal setting for leisurely strolls through nearby parks or cozy caf\u00e9s, where the atmosphere invites easy conversation and the enjoyment of the soft, winter light. As evening draws near, the sky will begin to adopt a slightly cloudier guise, with nightfall settling in around forty-nine degrees. Enjoy the day\u2019s tranquility, attuned to the gentle rhythm of San Francisco's urban pulse.",
