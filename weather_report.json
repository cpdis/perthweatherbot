    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air holds a palpable chill, whispering of impending rain that will blend seamlessly with the city\u2019s nighttime glow. The sky, partly cloudy at present, hints at the moisture to come. Temperatures will dip into the low forties, inviting warmth within layered clothing. A gentle northeast breeze stirs, carrying with it the promise of rain, approximately at dawn, igniting an atmosphere that teeters between tranquil and uneasy.\n\nCome Thursday, the city will wrap itself in a cloak of gray. Expect a relentless rain, sweeping across the skyline, with temperatures adopting a modest descent into the mid-fifties. The East Southeast wind will beckon from 6 to 22 mph, making the prospect of outdoor excursions less than appealing. If the notion of a stroll or outdoor brunch crosses the mind, it's best to reconsider and cozy up in a favorite cafe, rich with aromas of freshly brewed coffee, while the rain dances against the windowpane. As the day progresses, let the city\u2019s vibrant pulse resonate from within, offering solace from the damp embrace of the elements.",
