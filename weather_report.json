    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city basks under a clear, star-speckled sky. With temperatures dipping to a refreshing 44 degrees, the gentle east wind adds a whisper of chill, making it the perfect evening for a cozy walk through the streets. Tomorrow promises a sunlit embrace, with a sunny high near 59, gradually settling to a cooler 56 as the day progresses. The lack of fog allows the celebrated skyline to stand in crisp clarity, inviting wanderers to explore its familiar nooks and crannies without the usual marine layer obscuring the view.\n\nFor those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater would suffice, embodying just enough warmth to counter the lively breeze. As the vibrant lights of the city twinkle like distant stars, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet visit to one of the cozy cafes in North Beach, where the flickering candlelight beckons. The refreshing clarity of the night invites introspection or conversation, offering a serene respite from the hustle of the day.",
