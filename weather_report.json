    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Subiaco, the sky is polished and untroubled, stars pricking through a deep, velvet blue. The air feels calm and a touch cool, and visibility is clean, the sort of clarity that makes streetlights seem sharper than usual. Forecasts keep the pre-dawn hours clear, and the day looks set to open bright and uncomplicated; once the sun lifts, expect a high-contrast morning with hard-edged shadows and little haze. UV will ramp up quickly for spring, so even if the air stays gentle, treat the sun with respect.\n\nLight layers will suit the day: something warm for the early hours, easy to shed by mid-morning, with sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and a dab of sunscreen. It\u2019s pleasant-weather practical: good for fetching bread on foot, hanging a wash that will dry without fuss, an unhurried ride down quiet streets, or giving the garden a careful water before the light turns insistent. Lean into the simple chores and small errands; by midday, favor shade and a slower tempo, then let the afternoon\u2019s clear light carry you home.",
