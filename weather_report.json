    "weather_report": "Perth eases into late afternoon under a cloudless dome, the sun slanting warmly and sharpening every edge. It looks like a clean, high-clarity kind of day, the sort that shows off distant rooftops and the faint blue of the Darling Scarp. UV was fierce earlier, but is fading quickly now; if you\u2019re out before sunset, a hat and sunglasses still make sense, and after dusk the risk drops to almost nothing. Expect a gentle slide from bright and dry to comfortably cool as evening gathers, with a likely starry night. Light layers suit the mood: breathable shirt now, a soft extra layer ready for when the light drains away. It\u2019s pleasant, unhurried weather made for small errands on foot, a quiet loop around the block, or taking your cup of tea to the back step and letting the day settle. Supper outdoors will feel easy; later, a light jacket and an unhurried walk would be just right.",
