    "weather_report": "As dawn gently ushers in a new day over Subiaco, the lullaby of light rain continues to patter upon rooftops. The early hours paint a muted canvas, the sky draped in soft, overcast hues, akin to a watercolor painting still damp to the touch. The recent showers, tender as a whispered promise, may linger a bit longer, possibly accompanying your morning routine. While sunbeams play shy beneath the clouds, the day unfolds with a cool embrace, whispering of mild temperatures and a certain cloak of comfort for the inhabitants.\n\nThe air, cleansed by the night's rain, carries with it the earthy scent of a world reborn, inviting you to step outside with a light jacket to fend off the chill left in the storm's wake. Today is a day not for sun-soaked adventures, but for cozy introspections and gentle pursuits. Perhaps you might enjoy a leisurely walk beneath the sheltering canopy of verdant trees, or find solace in the pages of a good book as you cradle a warm mug in both hands. The simple, soulful acts that connect us closer to ourselves find a rightful place in such weather.",
