    "weather_report": "In the tranquil town of Subiaco, we stand amidst an enveloping tapestry of broken clouds. As the elegant sky transforms under this textured blanket, it mirrors the mellow hush imbued upon the day. Determination alone maintains the fading light, filtering a soft, diluted brightness that infuses a touch of grace to our world in crescendo. \n\nFor this evening, the shy sunshine, hindered behind the vast patchwork of clouds, might guide your wardrobe choices towards light, comforting layers. Perhaps a jacket would suit as a companion for twilight walks in the city, or a cup of warmth to nurse indoors while reading your favorite novel. The richness of the day suggests it's perfect for solitary contemplation, a gentle reset before the week. Outdoor cafes, bookstores, and park benches are ripe for the taking, waiting to be cloaked under tales of shared laughter and avid readers dive into worlds within pages.",
