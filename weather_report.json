    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the familiar embrace of a damp, drizzly night lingers. The air is thick with moisture, whispering promises of rain that are surely to come. Currently, the temperature rests just on the cusp of cool, inviting a quick wrap in comfortable layers, perhaps a well-loved sweater or a light waterproof jacket that will keep the chill at bay. \n\nThroughout the day, expect the drizzle to deepen, transforming into steady rain by late morning, intensifying until the afternoon. The cityscape, typically dressed in vibrant hues, will wear a more muted palette today, as the cloud cover obscures the sun and wraps the Golden Gate Bridge in a veil of mist. The combination of a Southeast wind gusting through the streets and the low-hanging clouds will surely conjure up the kind of atmosphere that prompts cozy retreats indoors. You may find pleasure in simple, grounding routines: perhaps a stroll through an art gallery, where the walls echo with creativity, or settling down with a warm drink in a caf\u00e9, the rhythmic patter of rain providing the perfect backdrop for indulgent reading. As the evening approaches, embrace the introspection that such weather inspires, and let it remind you of the beauty that exists even in the grayest of days.",
