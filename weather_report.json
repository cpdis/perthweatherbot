    "weather_report": "In the quiet cradle of Subiaco, as the morning unfurls like a tender blossom, the sky is heavy with the promise of rain that has been teasing with its gentle, yet insistent, patter since dawn. It is a day wrapped in soft, muted greys where the clouds perform a hushed ballet across the heavens. The sun plays the shy lover, peeking occasionally through gauzy veils, but largely leaving the stage to a low and moody drizzle. The air is thick with anticipation, and the world feels slightly veiled and introspective, mirroring the kind of melancholy beauty one might find in an old, sepia-toned photograph.\n\nAs you step outside, embrace the spontaneity the weather offers with a waterproof coat that guards against the drizzle yet allows for freedom of motion. The canvas of the day invites leisurely pursuits: maybe a stroll under the protective canopy of trees, their leaves whispering secrets to one another, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where you could read or sip on aromatic coffee while the world waltzes by in varied shades of grey. The ambiance suggests introspection and gentle activity, a day for delving into books or finding the poetry in everyday moments, rather than the blinding sunshine or vibrant hues. It is a subtle, reflective Friday, calling for quiet appreciation of its softened tones and muted charms.",
