    "weather_report": "Before sunrise in Bend the town is hushed and cold, the sky edging toward a pale blue with only a few stray clouds expected after dawn. As the morning unfolds, the sun should be generous but gentle, filtered by those high shreds of cloud; visibility looks clean in the dry air, and the day promises more light than gloom. UV stays low with the winter sun riding at a modest angle, so the glare may be sharper than the strength. It reads as a clear, uncomplicated morning.\n\nDress in layers you can peel back at a slow pace: a warm coat, hat, gloves, and sunglasses for that low, slanting brightness. It\u2019s a good window-seat day\u2014coffee steaming beside you\u2014punctuated by a short neighborhood walk, a quick run to the market before the rush, or a tidy-up in the garage with the door rolled open to the cool air. If you\u2019re out early, move unhurriedly and let the quiet do its work; the weather will meet you halfway.",
