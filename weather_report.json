    "weather_report": "Granbury wakes under a clean, quiet sky, the kind that sharpens the stars and lets the air feel a touch crisper than memory. The forecast has been steadfastly clear through the evening, and there\u2019s little to suggest it will do anything but brighten into a transparent morning and a sun-splashed day. UV is negligible before dawn and should stay modest by winter standards once the sun is up; light is generous, glare on pale surfaces likely. It looks like a plainspoken, pleasant day, all clarity and no fuss.\n\nDress in easy layers for the early chill\u2014a soft sweater or light jacket\u2014and keep sunglasses handy for the glare once it breaks over the rooftops; a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t be wasted if you linger outside by midday. At this hour, a slow cup of coffee on the porch or a gentle walk to catch first light would suit. Later, it\u2019s good weather for unhurried errands, tidying the garden, or a quiet drive down familiar roads with the windows cracked just enough to let the clean air in.",
