    "weather_report": "As the gentle glow of the setting sun dips beneath the horizon, Subiaco finds itself wrapped in a refreshing embrace of broken clouds. The afternoon sun played hide and seek with the sky, displaying a tapestry of scattered clouds that danced lazily across a wide, azure canvas. The evening now, cloaked in a cooler breath of dusk air, feels calming and introspective, inviting you to pause and reflect as the clouds form abstract art overhead. The UV index, a whisper of earlier daylight, has graciously made its exit, allowing the town a reprieve from the sun\u2019s vivid caress. This atmospheric play makes for a day that leans neither into the glaring brightness nor sullen gloom, offering instead a beautifully gauzy veil of light and shadow.\n\nTo attire oneself appropriately in the embrace of such a sky, consider layers that can easily shield against the soft, cool breeze, while still offering freedom to breathe beneath lighter clouds. A light jacket or sweater could mirror the transitional temperament of the atmosphere. Given the time you've been allotted by the day\u2019s events, it calls for a languid stroll through tree-lined avenues or, perhaps, a moment of tranquility on your porch with a cherished book in hand. Ah, Subiaco, twilight now frames you in soft hues, leaving ample space for simple, sincere pleasures.",
