    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a mostly open sky this afternoon, the sun softened by a few idle clouds that drift like thoughts between errands. The day has held steady and clear, and it looks to stay settled into evening, with light that turns warmer and more honeyed toward sunset. UV has eased from its midday bite but still warrants a little care if you\u2019ll be out for a while; sunglasses and a hat won\u2019t go astray. The air feels uncomplicated, the horizon crisp, the mood agreeable rather than dazzling.\n\nDress in simple layers you can shed and reclaim with the breeze: a breathable shirt now, a light jumper in your bag for when the light thins. It\u2019s good weather for ordinary pleasures\u2014walking the long way home, a gentle spin on the bike, picking up groceries on foot, watering the garden, or taking a quiet seat outside with a book as the evening unspools.",
