    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a ceiling of scattered cloud, softening the streetlights and dulling the last afterglow. The sun is gone and with it any bite of UV; readings now are negligible, and the night feels gentle rather than harsh. The sky will mottledly thicken toward broken cloud later, leaving only occasional gaps for a stray star to wink through. It\u2019s a calm, clear-enough night for unhurried thoughts.\n\nExpect more of this tempered mood through late evening into the small hours: no sunshine left to speak of, no glare, just a quiet, cloud-draped night. It looks pleasant in a modest way; take a light layer or cardigan if you linger outdoors, as clouds can make the air feel a touch cooler without the day\u2019s warmth. Good hours for a slow walk past the shopfronts, a late supper on the balcony, or trimming the loose threads of the week\u2014answer a letter, sort tomorrow\u2019s list, rinse the day from your shoulders and let the night do its steady work.",
