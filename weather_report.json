    "weather_report": "Before sunrise the air over Subiaco feels clean and unhurried, the sky already shrugging off the last of the stars. The forecast holds steady with clear skies through the early morning, promising a bright, uncluttered day where colors look freshly washed and edges sharp. Sunshine will take command quickly after dawn; UV exposure will be gentle at first but will climb decisively by late morning, the kind of spring day where the light looks innocent and isn\u2019t.\n\nIt should feel pleasant overall: cool in the early hours, warming readily under that generous blue. Start with a light layer and something you can peel off by mid-morning; sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat will soon earn their keep, and sunscreen belongs on the bench by the door. This is a good morning for ordinary pleasures\u2014a quiet walk before breakfast, hanging out the washing, cycling to the shops, tending the herbs, or taking your coffee outside and letting the day open around you\u2014then shifting indoor or shady after the sun gathers its strength.",
