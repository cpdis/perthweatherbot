    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a clean, glassy blue, the sun already brightening verandahs and pushing crisp shadows across the pavement. By mid-morning the air feels light and uncomplicated, the sort of clarity that makes edges look newly drawn. With the sky staying cloudless through late morning and into early afternoon, expect a steadily sharper glare and a UV bite that arrives faster than you think.\n\nIt looks like a pleasantly warm, sun-forward day: simple, dry, and good-tempered, though you\u2019ll want a hat, sunglasses, breathable layers, and sunscreen if you linger outside. Open the windows, let the house air itself, and hang a wash that will dry in no time. A gentle stroll to run errands before lunch suits the hour; a shaded caf\u00e9 table for reading or a quiet corner in the garden for small pruning or potting will suit the brighter stretch. Save anything strenuous for earlier or later, and give yourself a cool-water pause when the sun crests.",
