    "weather_report": "In the cool embrace of the San Francisco night, a shroud of clouds gently drapes the city, with the evening air whispering hints of moisture against the skin. The temperature languishes around the low 49s, rising softly as the night flows towards the dawn, inviting a slow awakening to the new day. As the hours advance, the forecast promises a sunnier scene on Sunday, with a high near 62, gently inviting residents and visitors alike to venture beyond their doors. \n\nTomorrow's sun will shine brightly, seeking to illuminate the lingering traces of marine fog that may dash towards the Golden Gate, blending with the soft hues of the dawn. The city is set to wake beneath a mostly sunny sky, punctuated by cool breezes from the north, perfect for a leisurely stroll through the parks or perhaps a quiet cafe on a bustling street corner. Dressing in layers will be wise; a light jacket should serve delightfully against the brisk morning air, while a T-shirt beneath will provide comfort as the temperature climbs. With the city alive yet tranquil, one might find joy in exploring hidden corners or simply savoring a passport of caffeine while gazing over the bustling urban tapestry as it unfolds.",
