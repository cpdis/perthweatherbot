    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a thick blanket of clouds, the promise of rain palpable in the air. The forecast warns of downpours before noon, followed by the rumble of thunderstorms, casting an indelible shadow over the cityscape. Temperatures gently slip from a surprising high, settling into the cool embrace of mid-fifties. Gusts of wind howl through the streets, urging you to don a sturdy jacket and perhaps a cap to ward off the dampness. Visibility is a challenge; the famed fog seems to hover just beyond the hills, mixing with the clouds, obscuring the iconic bridges that typically grace the skyline.\n\nAs night approaches, the showers will only intensify, creating a soothing rhythm against windowpanes. The low reaches toward fifty, with a slight flirtation of warmth as the night deepens. It's a perfect evening to cozy up with a good book in your favorite caf\u00e9, perhaps a cup of tea steaming gently beside you as the world outside slips into a murky gray. A stroll down to the waterfront might be enchanting still, the soft patter of rain a reminder of nature's poetry. Dress warmly, keep your umbrella close, and embrace the embrace of a comfortably stormy day.",
