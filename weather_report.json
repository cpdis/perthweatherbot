    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past eleven on this crisp evening in Downtown San Francisco, the city wears a semi-opaque shroud of coolness. Tonight\u2019s gentle clouds slide through the darkening sky, painted with hints of silvery moonlight as the air claims a gentle chill, resting around a mild fifty-two degrees. The winds whisper softly from the west-northwest, barely rustling the leaves, lending a tranquil vibe to the surroundings.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the promise of a rain-dappled Friday appears imminent, as the day forecasts a transition from partly sunny to a tapestry woven with rain after five o'clock. Beneath the horizon, a faint marine layer clings to the coastline, gently wrapping the Golden Gate in its tender embrace, suggesting that the fog might roll in, weaving its way through the streets in a classic dance. With the thermometer nudging close to sixty by afternoon, a light jacket or a cozy sweater may be prudent, especially paired with sturdy shoes to navigate the wet paths to come. As dusk envelops the city, one might consider ambling towards a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping a warm beverage while watching the rain begin its soft descent, or perhaps wander to the bookshop for a quiet perusal, indulging in the solitude that a rainy day brings.",
