    "weather_report": "As twilight descends on Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds envelops the city, whispering of rain to come. The air, already tasting of moisture, brings with it a chill that rests heavily on the skin. The streets, though still bathed in the remnants of daylight, will soon be drenched, as a steady downpour is forecasted for the night, transforming the familiar landscape into a watercolor of grays and blues. With temperatures meandering around the mid-fifties, the brisk gusts from the south weave through the alleyways, hinting at the robust windiness to follow. \n\nThe prospect of rain is inescapable; the city\u2019s typical fog has been replaced by an overcast dome, foreboding yet oddly comforting, as it encases the landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and the silhouette of downtown. Those venturing outside this evening would do well to reach for layers, perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, paired with comfortable shoes that can embrace puddles rather than shy away from them. Enjoying the evening may invite a refuge in a warm caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the sound of raindrops tapping against glass, fostering a sense of intimacy that a cooler, rainy evening can uniquely inspire.",
