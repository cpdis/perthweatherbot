    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the rain whispers down, wrapping the city in a cool embrace. The air is heavy with moisture, punctuated by a brisk south wind that invigorates the senses. It's a stark contrast to the bustling life the city typically exhibits, as the streets become glistening rivers reflecting the muted glow of streetlights. With temperatures hovering in the low fifties, the promise of warmth is just a gentle reminder of the cozy indoors. Fog clings close to the structures, blurring the edges of familiar outlines, while the marine layer creeps in, lending a mystical quality to the city still awake under the veil of clouds.\n\nAs morning breaks, expect rain to continue its relentless fall, followed by showers and the rumble of distant thunder, cloaking the skyline in a symphony of nature\u2019s whims. A chill will linger in the air, perfect for savoring a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or taking a stroll through one of the many art-filled corridors that breathe life into the city. Dressing in layers remains prudent as the high reaches only into the upper fifties; a light waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes will serve well against the wet pavement. Seek solace in quiet corners of bookstores or galleries, where the essence of the day reflects a cozy, contemplative mood, perfect for reflection or intimate conversation.",
