    "weather_report": "Subiaco has slipped into a clear, tranquil night, the sky polished to a dark sheen with nothing to blur the stars. The air feels uncomplicated and steady, and the forecast keeps it that way through late evening and into the small hours: cloudless, dry, and calm. There is no glare now, no hint of haze, and the UV presence is essentially absent with the sun long gone.\n\nIf these bare skies hold, morning should arrive with unfiltered light and quick clarity, the kind that sharpens shadows and nudges the UV index upward once the day gets going. For now, lean into comfort: light layers or a soft cardigan are enough, with sunglasses and a brimmed hat laid out for tomorrow\u2019s errands. It\u2019s a quietly pleasant night for ordinary rituals done well\u2014a slow loop around the block, a simple meal on the balcony, a tidy-up of the week\u2019s loose ends, or a brief visit to a friend\u2019s stoop. The scene asks for unhurried steps and eyes that wander upward.",
