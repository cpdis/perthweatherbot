    "weather_report": "As night descends over Downtown San Francisco, the skyline is shrouded in a veil of darkness, punctuated only by the warm glows of streetlamps and windows. The weather is aligning with the forthcoming rain, which is expected to sweep in after the witching hour. Temperatures will dip to a crisp 47 degrees, accompanied by gentle southeasterly breezes. A relentless 90% likelihood of precipitation looms over the city, hinting at new rainfall that will gently nourish the earth.\n\nTomorrow, the rain continues its serenade, promising a high of 56 degrees beneath a blanket of cloud cover. The forecast suggests a 100% chance of precipitation, with expected accumulations between a quarter and half an inch. The city, often at the mercy of the marine layer, will likely find the fog caressing its hills, though it may be less prominent tonight. Residents are encouraged to don warm layers, perhaps a snug sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, as they venture outside. Evening strolls while the raindrops begin to dance on the pavement could offer a serene experience, mixing the freshness of a stormy winter night with the comforting glow of the city lights. Alternatively, one might choose the solace of a local caf\u00e9, sipping a steaming beverage while the world outside succumbs to a soothing rainfall.",
