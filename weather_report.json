    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the afternoon greets us with a gentle clarity, the sun casting its golden light over the cityscape, though a chill whispers through the air as temperatures taper off. As the afternoon unfolds, the bright skies hint at the fading warmth, transitioning into the embrace of a cool evening. Fog may dance along the edges of the horizon, especially towards the bay, but for now, it remains at bay, allowing the Golden Gate Bridge and iconic skyline to present themselves in crisp detail against the backdrop of gentle, rolling hills.\n\nAs night approaches, the clouds will weave themselves back into the canvas of the sky, giving way to a low temperature that invites layers. Consider a light jacket to ward off the evening chill, perhaps a scarf to protect against the brisk north northeast winds, which will continue to caress the streets. This sets the stage for a perfect evening stroll along one of the quieter paths, perhaps along the waterfront where the views of the city lights reflecting off the water are particularly enchanting. Whether you choose to engage in quiet reflection beneath the stars or indulge in the culinary delights of the local eateries, it\u2019s a moment to relish in the understated beauty of the city.",
