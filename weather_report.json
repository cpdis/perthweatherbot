    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a ceiling of heavy clouds and a palpable spirit of urgency as rain showers precede a veritable symphony of thunder. The temperature treads a cool path around fifty-eight degrees, under the brisk south winds that stir the air like whispers through the alleys, gusting to thirty miles per hour. It's a day marked by the relentless drumming of raindrops and the certainty of a hundred percent chance of precipitation. With the promise of new rainfall accumulating between a quarter and half an inch, one cannot escape the hint of dampness that clings to the heart of the city.\n\nAs evening approaches, the ambiance transforms but retains its brooding charm. Showers and thunderstorms persist, accompanied by a soothing lead-in of clouds that wrap the city like a well-worn blanket. Drops will continue to fall, and with low temperatures hovering around forty-eight degrees\u2014but inching toward a soft fifty overnight\u2014the brisk southwest winds echo a suggestion for cozy attire. Layers will serve the day well; a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes will prepare any wanderer for an unexpected deluge. Embrace the warm interior of a local caf\u00e9, or perhaps find solace in the pages of a book at home as the weather invites introspection. The skies may be gray, but there is beauty in the storm, a gentle reminder that even the most dreary days can cradle moments of creativity and warmth.",
