    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city is shrouded in a soothing veil of rain, a gentle symphony tapping against rooftops and streets, serenading the early risers. The low clouds cloak the skyline, creating a hushed atmosphere that captures the essence of this coastal enclave. With temperatures hovering around a cool 47 degrees, the air carries a damp chill, suggesting the perfect moment for a cozy embrace from your favorite oversized sweater or a stylish raincoat, paired with dependable boots to navigate puddles forming beneath your feet.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the rain is set to continue its steady descent, with afternoon temperatures cooling to around 54 degrees, mirroring the persistent cloud cover overhead. For those reflecting on their plans, indoor activities beckon, perhaps a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup of coffee, allowing the scent of roasted beans to lift the spirits. Alternatively, the warmth of a bookstore or art gallery can provide respite from the melancholic weather, offering a chance to immerse oneself in a good book or the beauty of creative expression. Today may not inspire outdoor adventures, but it presents a fine opportunity to find joy in the quiet comforts of home or the rich offerings of the city\u2019s beloved indoor spaces.",
