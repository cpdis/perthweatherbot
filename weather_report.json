    "weather_report": "Evening comes to Subiaco glazed and quiet, a soft rain freckling pavements and dimming the edges of the city. Skies are thick with cloud, so sunshine is largely a memory now; the UV index has slipped to negligible and will stay there through the night. The air feels clean but a little murky at street level, lights haloed in the drizzle, colors deepened to pewter and ink.\n\nExpect on-and-off light showers to loiter into the night, keeping things cool and a touch melancholy rather than harsh. A light rain jacket with a hood and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles will serve you well; add a thin layer if you chill easily. It\u2019s a good night for the small, satisfying errands of ordinary life: a quick grocery dash under the awnings, an unhurried tram ride, a quiet cup at the corner cafe, or a slow simmering pot at home while the rain ticks at the window. If you need fresh air, take a short, hood-up wander and listen to the city breathe.",
