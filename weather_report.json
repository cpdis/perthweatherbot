With temperatures dipping into the mid-forties, there\u2019s a crispness in the air that beckons for a light jacket. The serenity of the night gives way to the promise of a sunny Thanksgiving Day, where the sun will grace the city with its presence, climbing to a high near fifty-eight before gradually retreating into the afternoon chill. A gentle breeze from the north-northeast whispers through the streets, adding a subtle bite to the air that reminds us of the season.\n\nAs the city stirs, the famed fog, so often a participant in the San Francisco narrative, remains at bay, lending itself instead to clarity that invites exploration. The marine layer, typically hovering around the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, appears to have retreated, allowing for uninterrupted vistas of the day ahead. This unobstructed view is an invitation to enjoy the outdoors\u2014perhaps a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering water reflects the crisp blue sky, or a casual caf\u00e9 visit in one of the city\u2019s many neighborhoods where the warmth of fresh coffee harmonizes with the coolness of the morning air. As the day unfolds, dressing in layers will enhance the experience, ensuring comfort amidst the shifting temperatures, allowing one to embrace both warmth under the sun and the brisk coolness of the bay breeze.",
