    "weather_report": "Osborne Park wakes under an open, lacquer-blue sky, the sun already bright and intent. The air has that hard-edged clarity that makes colors pop and shadows go inky, a promise that the rest of the day will stay clean and cloudless. Expect the UV to surge from very high toward extreme through late morning into early afternoon; the light will be beautiful but insistent, the sort that warms your shoulders and reminds you to respect it.\n\nPlan for a warm, likely hot afternoon of steady sunshine. It\u2019s a day for breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses that earn their keep, and a good layer of sunscreen; carry water and chase shade where you can. Run quick errands before lunch, let a load of washing meet the breeze, or take a brief, unhurried walk along a leafy street. After midday, retreat into a quiet caf\u00e9 or the cool hush of a library, sort a drawer, sketch a small plan, then step back out as the light softens toward evening.",
