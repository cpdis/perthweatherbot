    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, predawn sky, the streets hushed and clean as if freshly ironed. The air feels crisp on the skin, and the horizon is beginning to pale; a promise that the day will open bright. With no clouds in the way, the sun should take quick command once it rises, lending a hard, silvery clarity to everything. UV will start low at first light and build steadily under full sunshine, likely reaching at least moderate by late morning, so plan for shade and sunscreen as the day matures.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant day in the making: cool enough early for a light jumper, easy to shed to a shirt once the sun gets to work. A short, quiet walk to greet the first birds, then a coffee by a window suits the hour; later, simple errands by bike, a tidy-up in the garden, or reading on a balcony where the light is kind but not direct. Sunglasses in the bag, a hat after breakfast, and you\u2019ll be set to enjoy the clean, unbothered blue overhead.",
