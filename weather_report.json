    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfurls with a gentle warmth tempered by whispers of cool breezes. The sky dons a partly sunny attire, with patches of light slipping through the clouds, casting a serene glow on the streets below. The air carries a crisp hint of the ocean, combining with the more urban scents of the city, creating an invigorating backdrop for a mild day. The expectation of a high near 57 degrees invites a need for light layers \u2013 perhaps a cozy sweater or a light jacket, perfect for an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero. \n\nThe bay showcases a soft veil where the marine layer drapes like a delicate shawl, especially over the Golden Gate, hinting at the potential encroachment of fog as evening approaches. As dusk settles, the temperature will drift softly down to around 46, making it an ideal time for relaxed indoor activities or savoring a warm drink outside. One might find joy in a quiet caf\u00e9, listening to the world hum while watching the sun dip below the horizon, or perhaps take a leisurely walk along quiet streets, the lingering light casting long shadows and inviting introspection.",
