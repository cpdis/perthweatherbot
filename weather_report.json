    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds lingers, casting a gentle shroud over the waking city. The tranquil morning hints at an imminent chill, whispering promises of a low around 46 degrees. The bite of the north-northeast wind adds a crispness to the air, nudging one to layer a soft sweater or a light jacket before venturing outside. \n\nThe daylight is anticipated to unfold with a touch of warmth as the sun tries to pierce through, bringing a high near 59. Yet, like the tide pulling back from the shore, temperatures may drift down to 56 by afternoon. Despite the sun's hopeful appearance, a chance of rain settles in the forecast, especially after 4 p.m., and a confluence of clouds may add a sense of dimness to the vibrant skyline. The possibility of light rain may sway those plans for a leisurely stroll by the waterfront; perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 visit, with a steaming cup of coffee, might be preferable to enjoy the softer ambiance this weather invites. The day beckons for a sense of ease, a gentle reminder to embrace both enthusiasm and caution, as unpredictable weather can be the unwelcome guest at any event.",
