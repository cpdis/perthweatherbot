    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a heavy veil of clouds, the kind that blot out the sun and promise rain. Outside, the air is thick with humidity, conducive to a drenching that is soon to arrive. As the day progresses, rain will sweep in, accompanied by showers and the occasional rumble of thunder, a reminder of nature's unpredictable edge. Expect temperatures to settle around the mid-fifties, while a brisk southwest wind stirs, adding a chill that will wrap around you like a damp embrace.\n\nThe marine layer clings stubbornly to the hills and bridges, obscuring the views and lending an ethereal quality to familiar landmarks. Fog drifts lifelessly over the bay, creating a hushed atmosphere that suggests a day best suited for quiet reflection or a cozy respite. Dress warmly, layering with a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes, as puddles will form and puddles tend to splash. As the rain begins to fall, consider retreating to a local caf\u00e9, allowing the rhythmic tap of the rain against the window to provide a soothing backdrop for a well-earned cup of coffee or tea. Writing or reading might prove comforting pursuits as stormy clouds gather overhead, transforming your surroundings into a serene indoor haven.",
