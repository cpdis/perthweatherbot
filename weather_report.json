The temperature is on the cusp of a cool 55 degrees, sinking slowly to 53 as the day matures. A mere whisper of rain lingers in the hours before four, cast aside by the feeble sunlight overhead. Despite the vigorous wind from the northwest, the city is mostly clear, with the familiar embrace of the marine layer retreating, leaving the horizon free of fog and inviting exploration.\n\nTonight, expect a restful blanket of clarity, the sky wide and unobstructed as the temperature drops towards a refreshing 42 degrees. The north-northwest wind carries a refreshing chill, reminding you of the evening's quiet promise. Dressing in layers is wise\u2014a light jacket will keep the cool air at bay, revealing the warmth nestled beneath. As dusk sets in, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or an intimate evening at a cozy caf\u00e9 will provide respite from the day's cool embrace. There is beauty in the simple moments today brings, so savor them.",
