    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a tranquil, partially sunlit canvas. While the day promises a high temperature that hovers near the cool 57 degrees, the afternoon will invite a gradual retreat to a cozy 54. A gentle northwest breeze whispers through the streets, bringing a touch of crispness that mingles with the scent of Bay air. The morning presents a mostly clear outlook, though hints of the marine layer linger nearby, hinting at a day's end when the fog may softly encroach upon the skyline.\n\nToday is one of those pleasing San Francisco days where a light jacket might be your finest companion. The playful interplay of sunshine and clouds invites a stroll through the eclectic neighborhoods or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the many local caf\u00e9s, sipping a warm brew while observing the flow of city life. It\u2019s an ideal day to wander, perhaps to explore Lombard Street or take a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, engaging with the rhythm of the city without rushing. As evening approaches, the coolness may inspire a cozy indoor retreat, perhaps with a good book or the warmth of friendly company.",
