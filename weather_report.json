    "weather_report": "Subiaco, as evening gently wraps herself around the day, finds itself beneath a sky adorned with broken clouds. The whimsical dance of the setting sun is obscured, yet filtered light enriches the atmospherics of this quiet time. It's not the perfect day for sun-seekers, as the roguish sun has chosen today to play hide-and-seek behind the clouds, yet a unique serenity accompanies this subdued luminance. \n\nThe weather carries with it a cool veneer that calls for light layers \u2013 perhaps a comfortable cashmere sweater to fend off the playful chill. Subiaco offers the perfect ambiance for a thoughtful stroll or perhaps huddled conversation at the local cafes, relishing their renowned espressos, accompanied by the day's waning light and the casual rebellion of the weather. Night quietly whispers promises of a peaceful yet cloudy evening. As we let another day retire into the memory of time, remember to tread softly, for even though the UV index sleeps now, it's never too late to show kindness to oneself - protect and nourish your skin. Enjoy and embrace the escapades nature weaves each day.",
