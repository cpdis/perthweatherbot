The partially cloudy night sky reveals a glimmer of stars, hinting at the clear yet chilly morning ahead. By daybreak, expect the sun to peek through, breaking the coolness of night with a swift ascension to a daytime high of 53\u2014a gradual retreat to the slightly cooler embrace of 51 as afternoon settles in. \n\nA hint of rain lurks in the afternoon, only peeking through the clouds post 4 PM, with a soft 40% chance to dampen the day. The West-Northwest winds flirt at speeds of 3 to 12 mph, barely disturbing the quiet streets. Fog may dance at the edges of the Golden Gate but is less likely to blanket the city this time. For those venturing out, a layered approach is wise\u2014think of a lightweight jacket to fend off the morning chill, and a scarf to keep warmth around your neck as you navigate the streets. A stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warming beverage, perhaps a focus on culinary delights at a local eatery, or a stroll through quiet neighborhoods will suit you well. The day beckons softly\u2014an invitation to linger a while longer in the embrace of a city that thrives on quiet moments.",
