    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives under a polished blue dome, the light crisp and steady, edges of buildings cut a little sharper than usual. With the sky largely untroubled by cloud, the sun has some bite; UV will be assertive through the early afternoon, so a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are wise companions, with light, breathable layers and a bottle of water in tow. The air feels clean and open, a day that invites you out but reminds you to mind the glare.\n\nThis clarity looks set to linger through the afternoon, softening only as the sun tilts toward evening. It\u2019s a good time for ordinary pleasures: a gentle walk to run an errand, lunch on a shaded terrace, hanging the wash where it can drink the light, a quiet spin to the shops on a bicycle, or a book on a bench while the leaves stir. As the heat eases and shadows lengthen, the outdoors should feel friendlier, and the world a touch more forgiving.",
