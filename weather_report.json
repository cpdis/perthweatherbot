    "weather_report": "Morning in Cottesloe arrives bright and untroubled, the sky polished to an easy blue. Forecasts point to clear skies from late morning through the afternoon, the light sharp and generous, the air warming with intent. Expect that familiar high-summer glare off the water and stone; the UV will be unforgiving by midday, even as the day stays beautifully clear and well defined right to the horizon.\n\nKeep it simple: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, strong sunglasses, and sunscreen you\u2019ll actually reapply; carry water and seek pockets of shade. Hang the washing early or take a quiet coffee on Napoleon Street before the sun begins to bite, then slip indoors for a while\u2014library, gallery, a lingering lunch\u2014until the sea breeze begins to turn the pages of the afternoon. Later, a gentle walk along the foreshore or a few errands on the bike will feel right in the softer light; at home, open the windows to the breeze and let the evening settle the heat.",
