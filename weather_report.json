    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle warmth touch, embracing the city in a hint of sunshine filtered through a soft, hazy sky. The day, though marked by a high that hovers near 60, promises a subtle descent towards the mid-50s as the hours draw on. The north wind whispers lightly at seven miles per hour, adding a refreshing caress to the otherwise vibrant atmosphere. As day pivots toward night, clouds will begin to quilt the sky, heralding the arrival of rain just past the witching hour of four.\n\nWhile the sun casts its last golden rays, consider stepping out for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. The views of the bay and the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge are particularly enchanting during this time. The breeze beckons for layers; a light sweater or a casual jacket will offer comfort, especially as evening settles in and temperatures dip to a cooler threshold. With the likelihood of rain, one might find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, enjoying a warm drink while the world transitions to the quiet hum of nighttime activity, illuminated by the shimmering reflections across the water.",
