    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips past midnight under a clean, starry dome; the air feels dry and honest, the kind that carries the faintest sounds across sleeping streets. The forecast keeps the sky clear through the small hours into dawn, so expect a crisp, uncomplicated start and a day that brightens quickly. Sun strength will be gentle before sunrise and then rise sharply, with the UV index ramping from low to decidedly strong by late morning; the light will be hard-edged and the colors sharp, a day of high clarity and little fuss from clouds.\n\nDress with a light layer for the early chill and plan to shed it once the sun takes the stage; breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen will serve you well. It looks like a pleasant morning to open the windows for a while, water the garden before the heat settles in, take an unhurried walk to the corner shop, or cycle to pick up bread while the streets are still yawning awake. Aim to run errands early and save something cool and quiet for the middle of the day when the sun starts to glare.",
