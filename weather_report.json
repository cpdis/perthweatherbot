    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a flawless, enamel-blue sky, the sort of morning where sunlit edges feel newly sharpened and the air has that clean, see-right-through-it clarity. The day ahead holds steady and bright, with clear skies carrying you from late morning into the afternoon; sunshine will be unfiltered and generous, and the UV climbs quickly to high levels around the middle of the day, so shade and sunscreen are worth treating as companions rather than afterthoughts. It\u2019s pleasantly warm rather than heavy, the kind of weather that invites light layers, breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat and dark lenses; slip a small bottle of water in your bag and you\u2019re set. If you\u2019re out now, a slow walk to the shops or a coffee on a quiet verandah will suit the mood; later, tend to the herb pots, air the house, or hang a fresh load of washing that the sky will happily take care of. Keep the brisk errands for morning and the unhurried reading for the shade.",
