    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Galveston arrives clear and bright, the sun angling low and painting the water with buttery light. The sky has been open since early morning and stays mostly cloudless, so it feels frankly sunny rather than fierce; the winter UV peaked at a modest midday and is easing now, though reflections off the Gulf can still be sharp. The air reads clean and salt-tinged, horizons crisp, the kind of clarity that makes colors feel freshly rinsed.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant day made for easy pace: light layers with a windproof shell, sunglasses, maybe a hat and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger by the water. Consider a slow walk along the Seawall before sundown, a quiet spin on a bike, or a simple errand turned amble through the Strand with a coffee in hand. As evening draws in under a glassy sky, the warmth will slip away, so keep that extra layer nearby and let the day taper into a pale-gold dusk.",
