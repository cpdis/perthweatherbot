    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a clear, untroubled night after a day that faded without a cloud to snag the light. The air feels clean and uncomplicated, visibility sharp, the kind of clarity that makes streetlights seem crisp and far-off sounds travel. UV is essentially absent now, of course; earlier, under that open sky, it would have been assertive, the sort that asks for shade and a hat.\n\nThe forecast holds to simplicity: clear this evening and on into the small hours, which hints at a bright, honest sunrise if the pattern continues. It looks pleasant rather than harsh, the sort of weather that rewards small rituals. Step out for a gentle circuit of the block, unhurried, or crack a window and let the cooler air drift through while you make a quiet list for tomorrow. Dress in light layers\u2014a soft tee with a cardigan or light jacket is enough\u2014and keep the sunscreen by the door for morning, when the sun will get its voice back quickly. If you\u2019re up early, a coffee on the porch and a short walk before the day gathers pace would suit this sky.",
