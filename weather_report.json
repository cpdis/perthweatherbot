    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a thick blanket of clouds, promising a night filled with rain as strong as the gusts of wind swirling through its streets. The temperature hovers around a cool 50 degrees, with hints of warmth as it rises gently overnight. As you step outside, the wet air wraps around you, the scent of impending rain mingling with the urban aromas of the city. With a 100% chance of precipitation, it\u2019s wise to prepare for a good soaking; umbrellas will be your faithful companions.\n\nTomorrow carries the same promise of rain, punctuated by showers and the occasional clap of thunder, adding a touch of drama to the gray backdrop. The temperature will dip slightly in the afternoon, creating a chilly environment that calls for layers. A waterproof jacket accompanied by warm, comfortable clothing is advisable for braving the elements. Yet, even in this bleak landscape, there are activities to embrace. Perhaps you might stroll through the comforting embrace of a local caf\u00e9 with a good book, where the warmth inside contrasts beautifully with the cold outside, or seek solace in one of the city\u2019s many galleries, where inspiration beckons in the form of art. It may not be a day for grand adventures, but in the melody of rain and the soft whispers of the wind, there lies a poetic charm, waiting to be discovered.",
