    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a high, clean light at midday, the sky mostly open with only a few modest clouds expected to wander through the afternoon. The day feels clear and decisive, visibility wide and colors bright. It should remain largely sunny as the hours slide toward late afternoon. UV is punchy now and will mellow later; for the moment, the sun asks for a little deference.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant day if you chase shade at first. Wear light, breathable layers with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a sweep of sunscreen; keep water close. A quiet lunch on a verandah or under a generous tree suits the hour, followed by a quick errand on foot or a spell of reading by a bright window. As the sun softens later, a short spin on the bike, a meander through the neighborhood, or tending to small garden tasks would fit the mood of this clear, steady afternoon.",
