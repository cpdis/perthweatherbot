    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Flinders Park with a soft, pewter sky and the hush that comes before rain. The sun is long gone and with it any bite of UV; the index is effectively nil now. Clouds hold their ground, smudging the edges of the evening and lending the streets a dim, reflective sheen under the lamps. It\u2019s not a clear night, but it is a gentle one.\n\nLight rain is due to drift in after midnight and linger toward the small hours, more a persistent patter than a downpour. Expect a cool, slightly damp feel rather than anything fierce. Dress in easy layers with a light waterproof on top, closed shoes that won\u2019t mind a sprinkle, and keep an umbrella propped by the door. It\u2019s a night for unhurried errands and modest comforts: a short stroll between showers, picking up a few groceries you forgot, setting a simple supper to simmer, or tending to a small household task while the rain works its quiet rhythm outside.",
