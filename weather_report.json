    "weather_report": "As dawn hovers over Downtown San Francisco, the remnants of rain gently retreat from the streets, leaving behind a cool, crisp blanket clinging to the air. The clouds, dark and brooding, cast a veil over the cityscape, offering only a hint of brightness as the sun struggles to break through. With temperatures lingering around 55 degrees and a west-southwest wind whisking through at a brisk pace, the day feels raw yet invigorating. The morning carries that unmistakable scent of damp earth, punctuated by the occasional glimmers of sunlight that do peek through the clouds, only to be swallowed again by the encroaching fog.\n\nThe prospect of a mostly cloudy day with temperatures that peak in the late afternoon promises to imbue the city with that familiar, moody charm. The chance for rain remains ever so slight after the early morning showers, transforming any wanderings into a delightful dance with the elements. Wrap yourself warmly\u2014a jacket and perhaps a light scarf would serve well against the wind's occasional nips. With the right layers, one might find comfort in seeking out local caf\u00e9s, cozied up with a book or indulging in warm bites while the world outside glimmers under a damp sheen. Alternatively, a quiet stroll along the waterfront, where the mist swirls playfully, might reveal hidden vistas of a city alive in its shrouded beauty, beckoning you to embrace the unfolding day.",
