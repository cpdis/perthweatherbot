    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the current atmosphere is characterized by a hint of warmth despite lingering coolness, as the sun casts a gentle light over the city. This afternoon, skies are partly sunny, with temperatures dipping slowly to around 53, inviting a sense of calm as the clouds drift lazily overhead. A light breeze from the west northwest whispers through the streets, gently swaying the branches of the city's iconic trees, and the reflections on the bay promise a serene evening ahead.\n\nAs night approaches, expect the fog to creep in, quietly shrouding the landscape after 3 AM, creating a blanket of mystery. Tonight's chill will settle around 47 degrees, encouraging cozy layers; a warm jacket and perhaps a scarf will serve well against the cool night air. Given the weather's embrace, an evening stroll along the waterfront or a quiet dinner at a nearby caf\u00e9 would be delightful, allowing the rhythm of the city to soothe the senses, even as the fog begins its dance with the skyline.",
