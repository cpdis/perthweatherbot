    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco greets the late afternoon with an optimistic stretch of mostly sunny skies, though a crisp chill lingers in the air. The temperature hovers around a brisk 53 degrees, courtesy of a gentle west-southwest breeze that may wrap you in its cool embrace as the sun begins its descent toward the horizon. Those soft rays will soon be replaced by cloud cover as twilight arrives, leading into an expected drizzle that will likely commence after an early dinner, with an 80% chance of moisture to greet the night.\n\nAs the light fades, the atmosphere thickens with clouds, hinting at the encroaching marine layer, which cloaks the Golden Gate in its characteristic mist. You might notice shadows lingering over the bay, suggesting pockets of fog may start to creep in. Dressing in layers would be wise; consider a light jacket to ward off the evening chill and drizzles. As day transitions to night, a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit can offer respite. Lean into the satisfying embrace of a warm drink while the world outside shifts from stark clarity to the soft, damp glow of an urban evening, making for a remarkably contemplative experience.",
