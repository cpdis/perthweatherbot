    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco feels hushed and expectant, the sky a quilt of scattered cloud that dulls the horizon before first light. It isn\u2019t sunny now, and it won\u2019t brighten quickly; by breakfast a light, obliging rain is likely to settle in, softening edges and glossing the pavements. UV is low at this hour, but once the sun climbs, even through breaks in cloud, it can sharpen fast in springtime Perth, so plan for protection later if the sky thins. The day looks gentle rather than sparkling, clear enough to see your plans through, yet a touch muted by showers.\n\nDress in light layers with a small rain jacket or compact umbrella, and shoes you don\u2019t mind brushing dry at the door. A calm start suits the hour: put the kettle on, check the trains, and step out for a short, unhurried walk under the whispering trees before the rain firms up. Through the morning, run modest errands between showers, ducking under awnings, or settle into a tidy-up of the desk and inbox while the gutters murmur. If the cloud breaks after lunch, slip out for a coffee in a quiet courtyard, sunscreen at the ready, and enjoy the softened light as the day makes a slow, silvered turn toward evening.",
