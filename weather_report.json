    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco feels rinsed and untroubled, the sky an unbroken pane of blue and the light turning honeyed at the edges. Shadows lengthen across verandas and shopfronts; the air looks clean enough to ring like glass. It has been a bright, uncomplicated day and stays that way into the evening, with sunshine easing toward a gentle sunset and a clear, starry follow-through. UV would have peaked around midday but is slipping to low now, so the glare softens even as the color deepens.\n\nExpect a pleasant, dry evening: ideal for an unhurried walk to the grocer, a quiet lap of the oval, or sitting outside with a book while the day lets go. Dress in light layers; short sleeves feel right for the moment, with a thin cardigan or overshirt handy once the warmth drains from the pavements. If you\u2019re still out before dusk, a hat and a touch of sunscreen remain sensible; after that, just enjoy the clarity and the calm.",
