    "weather_report": "As afternoon settles over Subiaco, the earlier light showers have left the air gently perfumed with the scent of rain touching earth. The clouds part intermittently, offering warm glimpses of sunlight that weave through the softened light, painting the day in silvery hues and ensuring the air retains a cool embrace. Though the sun peeks through shyly, it never dares to unleash its full power today, so the UV index remains merciful, granting comfort to bare arms and unadorned faces. As errands call or a stroll beckons, a light jacket is companion enough, a shield against any lingering breezes and a nod to the sky\u2019s capriciousness.\n\nWith the rainfall taking a break, the town's vibrant heart begins to hum again; this is the perfect moment for a meander through Subiaco's beloved streets. Consider an amble toward the local park, where the leaves retain a gentle sheen from their sky-given bath. Each step on the dampened paths becomes a rhythmic meditation, a lilting balance between the cool breeze and the caress of the sun as it dances over your shoulders. Let the world slow as you savor the simple pleasures \u2014 a coffee to order at a street-side cafe, a moment spent gazing at artfully hewn shop windows, or even a pause on a bench to watch life flow around you. Today is a day kissed gently by nature, inviting ease and contemplation rather than fervent activity.",
