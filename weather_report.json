    "weather_report": "Midday finds Perth under a softened sky, the light diffused and gentle, colors a touch muted, the air calm enough to invite small errands and an unhurried lunch. Through the afternoon the cloud deck looks to thicken toward a steady overcast, then loosen to broken patches by late day, letting through pale wafers of sun. Despite the veil, the UV bite remains real at this time of year; treat the light with respect. Expect a day that feels temperate rather than blazing, easy on the eyes, with no strong hint of rain\u2014more a pewter ceiling than a threat. Dress in light layers and breathable fabrics, with a hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses for those brighter breaks. It\u2019s a good time for everyday pleasures: a shaded caf\u00e9 table and a slow sandwich, a library run, a tidy-up of the balcony plants, and\u2014once the clouds begin to fray toward late afternoon\u2014a quiet walk by the river to watch the day soften.",
