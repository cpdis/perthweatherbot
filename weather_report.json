    "weather_report": "A soft, pewter morning settles over Subiaco, the light subdued and the edges of things slightly blurred. Light rain visits in spells through the morning hours, likely lingering into the early afternoon, the sun mostly a rumor behind a gauze of cloud. Clarity is gentle rather than sharp; colors look washed and thoughtful. Expect a day that feels calm and a little damp, the kind where traffic sounds are cushioned and the air smells like wet leaves. Even with the cloud, the midday UV can still nip, though more softly than on a bright day.\n\nDress with easy pragmatism: a light waterproof layer, breathable clothes beneath, and shoes you don\u2019t mind meeting a few puddles. Carry a compact umbrella for the passing showers. This is a good day for small, local errands done at an unhurried pace\u2014duck into a bakery between showers, browse a bookshop or a gallery, or linger over a late-morning coffee by a window and watch the street shine. If you\u2019re set on fresh air, take a short walk when the rain eases; the world will feel newly rinsed, and the day, while not sunny, has a quiet kind of charm.",
