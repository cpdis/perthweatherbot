    "weather_report": "Bend eases into evening under a quilt of scattered clouds, the last light thinning at the edges while pale scraps of sky still peek through. As night settles, the cover builds into a more continuous, broken layer, softening the moon and dimming the stars. The sun is essentially done for the day; any remaining brightness will be brief at dusk, and the UV is negligible. The air feels clear and calm, with just enough texture overhead to lend the skyline a subdued, cinematic hush rather than menace.\n\nDress in easy layers\u2014a warm fleece or light insulated jacket over a long sleeve, and something for your ears if you plan to linger. It\u2019s a good evening for modest ambitions: a short amble before the clouds thicken, a quick errand, or a quiet hour at a caf\u00e9 where the windows show the sky turning slate. If you\u2019re walking the dog, try for twilight to catch the last silvery gaps; stargazing can wait for a cleaner night.",
