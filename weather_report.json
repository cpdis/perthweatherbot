    "weather_report": "As the first light of dawn filters into Downtown San Francisco, a gentle moisture blankets the air, foretelling a day draped in clouds and a persistent chance of rain. At this hour, temperatures hover in the low fifties, reflecting the weight of the clouds overhead. The chance of precipitation looms large, promising New Year\u2019s rain to forge a fitting start for 2025. Winds whisper through the streets, their cadence picking up as the day unfolds, hinting at the tempest that may arise in the early afternoon.\n\nBy midday, expect the rain to peak with a soft yet assertive rhythm before giving way to breaks of sunlight, revealing the post-storm freshness within the city. Despite the anticipated chill, the spectacle of rain-soaked streets glistening under the shy sun may present an invitation to embrace nature\u2019s drama. For those venturing outside, a warm, water-resistant coat along with comfortable shoes will serve well against the dampness, while a cozy scarf may offer comfort against the fresh breeze that rises in the afternoon. A perfect day for a leisurely stroll through the city\u2019s iconic neighborhoods, absorbing the sights and sounds while dodging the raindrops, perhaps with a warm cup of coffee in hand to savor the moment.",
