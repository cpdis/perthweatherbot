    "weather_report": "Subiaco stirs under a kindly sky, the morning brightening with a scatter of high, untroubled cloud and a clean, polished light that carries far. Expect the day to stay mostly sunny into lunchtime and early afternoon, with only a few clouds drifting through. UV will creep to a moderate bite around mid\u2011day\u2014gentle until you linger\u2014so a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen are wise. Dress in light layers: a soft long sleeve or tee, a jacket you can fold over an arm once the sun gathers strength. It\u2019s amiable weather for ordinary pleasures: fetch a coffee and take the long way back, hang the washing to drink the light, tend a small corner of the garden, or settle by a window to finish a page before noon turns the streets a shade brighter.",
