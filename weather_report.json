    "weather_report": "Day opens under a soft gray lid in Katy, the light filtered and calm after sunrise. The morning leans overcast, easing toward midday into broken clouds that allow brief, silvery sun to slip through. Expect a low-glare day with subdued UV early and only a gentle uptick around lunch if the sky fractures a bit; the world will look matte and hushed, more pewter than chrome. Pleasant in a quiet, winter-tinted way. Dress in easy layers\u2014a long-sleeve or light sweater with a thin jacket you can shed if a brighter patch finds you\u2014sunglasses only useful near noon. This is a good morning for small, ordinary victories: a grocery run before the rush, tending to houseplants, tidying the desk by a window, or a late-morning stroll when the light softens and color edges back into the day. Steady weather, unhurried plans.",
