    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds drapes the skies, promising rain to sweep in later tonight. With temperatures cooling to a crisp 47 degrees, the gentle southeast breeze whispers of impending precipitation, with a 90% chance of rainfall ready to usher in the night. The city's skyline, albeit shrouded in a cloak of murky clouds, stands strong against the elements, hinting at the activity of the day. As the clock ticks toward the evening, one might sense the damp, brisk air congealing with the anticipation of rain, any lingering irony dissolved into the mist of the encroaching weather.\n\nTomorrow's forecast promises an unyielding stretch of rain, as the heavens open fully with a 100% chance of showers throughout the day. The high temperature will linger around a cool 56 degrees, a reminder to locals of the indomitable spirit of winter. The murky skyline may obscure even the most recognizable landmarks, with fog and a marine layer likely thickening further into the day, draping the Golden Gate Bridge in mystery. Given these conditions, layered clothing is essential, with water-resistant outerwear to fend off the persistent rain, paired with comfortable footwear that can withstand puddles along the streets. Ideal indoor activities could include a cozy visit to a local cafe, where one can revel in a warm drink while observing the rain streak down the windows, offering a meditative respite from the chaos outside.",
