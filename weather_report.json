    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a lucid blue, the kind of late-morning light that sharpens edges and brightens verandas. Right now it feels open and inviting, a clear sky giving the streets a gentle sparkle; by early afternoon a handful of scattered clouds should wander through, softening the glare without dimming the day. Expect strong sunshine\u2014UV running high to very high around midday\u2014so think breathable long sleeves, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a dab more sunscreen than you think you need. The air reads as clean and uncomplicated, a day built for simple tasks done without hurry.\n\nIf you\u2019re stepping out soon, take your coffee on a shady bench and let the warmth do the talking, then run a light errand on foot while the sun is still kind. As the afternoon brightens, shift to the cool side of the street: browse a bookshop, water the garden, hang the washing that will dry in a snap, or take a short, unhurried walk under leafy cover. It\u2019s a pleasant, honest day\u2014clear-eyed, sun-forward, and best handled with a little shade and unhurried grace.",
