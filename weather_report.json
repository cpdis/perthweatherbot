    "weather_report": "As dawn softly breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a canopy of scattered clouds that whisper of the coolness to come. Currently, the temperature rests around a refreshing 48 degrees, hinting at the crisp, almost electric air typical of this coastal haven. The gentle northeast breeze carries the promise of a pleasant day, and though the sun will provide generous warmth later on, an undertone of chill lingers in the morning\u2019s embrace.\n\nBy midday, expect the skies to open up in a brilliant display of sunshine, flooding the streets with light and lifting spirits. Highs will hover near 60 degrees, transitioning to a cozy 57 as the afternoon unfolds. Given the forecast, dress in layers to navigate the shift from cool morning air to sunnier, albeit still brisk, afternoon outings. Perhaps a brisk stroll along the Embarcadero could beckon, with the serenity of the bay on one side and the vibrant city life on the other. Or, you might find solace in a quiet nook of a caf\u00e9, warmed by the sip of freshly brewed coffee as the day rolls forward. Enjoy the clarity of today\u2019s sky, free of the fog that often cloaks the bay, inviting both exploration and reflection as the world comes alive around you.",
