    "weather_report": "In the crystalline hush of an early Sunday morning in Subiaco, the sky stretches above, devoid of clouds and radiant with stars. An uninhibited firmament makes for a breath-taking astral show, a mesmerizing and soothing sight for night owls and early birds. As the night rescinds its claim over the sky, it makes way for the dawn to paint the sky with streaks of coruscating apricot and buttery gold. This serene spectacle promises a day as clear as the pre-dawn sky, filled with an abundance of sunshine, a sumptuous feast for the senses. \n\nStriding forth into such a day might feel like stepping into a painting, the mood mirroring the impeccable beauty of the day. Bathed in sunlight, the world is reborn, rendering everything in sharp relief that was once obscured in the darkness. Temperatures are primed to be amiable and inviting. One should dress in light, breathable attire, the kind that embraces the breeze and sunshine. It's a day that insists on being relished outside, a novel in the park, a leisurely stroll through downtown, or simply a cup of coffee on the porch soaking up the prodigious sun.",
