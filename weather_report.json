    "weather_report": "Perth spends the afternoon under a burnished blue sky, the sun clean and insistent, the air remarkably clear so buildings and gums seem cut with a finer blade. It feels cheerfully dry and sun-forward rather than heavy, but the UV is punchy at this hour, softening later toward evening. Shade is your ally.\n\nExpect the clarity to hold straight through late day, with the light easing from bright to honeyed. Dress for easy movement and heat glare: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a bottle of water. It\u2019s a pleasant day for simple, useful things\u2014hang the washing, take a quiet loop along the river path, ride to the shops for a midweek top-up, or claim a shaded table for an unhurried coffee and a few pages of whatever you\u2019re reading. As the sun tilts lower, the UV backs off and the air turns kinder, perfect for tidying the garden or a slow stroll before supper.",
