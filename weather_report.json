    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds across Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of cloudiness drapes the city, hushed and contemplative under the dimming light. The air is cool, settling into the lower forties, inviting a cozy wrap of cardigan or scarf as one steps outside. The south-southwest breeze carries whispers of moisture, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle come morning, yet the promise of a mostly sunny day ahead imbues the atmosphere with an optimistic glow.\n\nSunday's approach heralds tempered warmth, peaking around sixty but likely dipping to a chillier fifty-six in the afternoon. The marine layer, that signature San Francisco mist, weaves its way through the landscape, perhaps teasing glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge before the sun stretches across the city to scatter the clouds. For those drawn to the allure of the outdoors, a morning stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely trip to a neighborhood caf\u00e9 could perfectly complement the day\u2019s serene, albeit cool, charm. Dressing in layers will be key\u2014light enough to navigate the fleeting warmth but substantial enough to ward off the evening\u2019s encroaching coolness.",
