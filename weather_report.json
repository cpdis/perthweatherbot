    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfurls under a sunny sky, a bright start that hints at a pleasant day ahead. As the sun rises higher, its warmth gently nudges the coolness of the lingering night away. The air is crisp yet soft, with a breeze from the northwest that whispers of autumn's arrival. Though the temperature is expected to reach around 67 degrees, it is wise to keep a light jacket on hand as the afternoon slips into the embrace of cooler air, settling around 64 degrees.\n\nTonight promises mostly clear skies, inviting the city to bask in the glow of countless stars, while the wind picks up, gusting with vigor. As fog usually plays hide-and-seek in these parts, today there seems to be a clarity to the air, with only hints of the marine layer skirting toward the coast, leaving the bridges visible and the skyline sharp against the horizon. In such delightful weather, one might take a leisurely stroll through the city's winding streets, perhaps stopping by a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage, or find a bench in a nearby park to soak up the sun's cheerful rays. Layers are advisable, allowing for the gentle shift in temperatures that this beautiful city is known for, ensuring comfort from noon till night.",
