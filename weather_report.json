    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere unfolds like a muted canvas, painted with shades of gray as rain graces the morning. The sky, heavy with clouds, promises more moisture throughout the day, particularly before the afternoon, when a gentle drizzle may continue to fall. Temperatures hover near a modest sixty, but a chill accompanies the falling mercury, suggesting a need for warmth amid the dampness. The robust southwest winds, whispering at 13 to 17 miles per hour, playfully ruffle the edges of umbrellas and jackets alike, occasionally punctuated by gusts reminding passersby of their brisk presence.\n\nAs the day evolutes into evening, the chances of drizzle taper, leaving behind a mostly clear sky to cradle the cool air, ideal for unwinding with a book at your favorite caf\u00e9 or taking a reflective stroll along the waterfront. Dress in layers to accommodate the shifting temperatures and breezes, perhaps opting for a cozy sweater beneath your light raincoat. The city's walkways call out for exploration, where you can appreciate the onset of evening's tranquility, perhaps with a warm beverage in hand, capturing the charm of a fog-laden San Francisco day.",
