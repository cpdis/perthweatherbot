    "weather_report": "Galveston wakes under a clean, porcelain sky and keeps it, the kind of blue that seems freshly rinsed by night. With early hours already clear and no hint of trouble, the day leans bright and open; expect full sunshine, shadows sharp as compass lines, and a UV bite that\u2019s gentle to moderate for December but still worth a dab of sunscreen and a pair of sunglasses. The air feels lucid, horizons well drawn, a light Gulf breath carrying a salt whisper without much sting. It\u2019s pleasant in that easy coastal way\u2014cool enough for a light layer or a soft jacket in the breeze, warm enough by afternoon to roll up sleeves and linger. Good weather for unrushed errands on foot, a slow loop along the Seawall on a bike, beachcombing for small curios, or a simple patio lunch and a chapter of something dog-eared. If you\u2019re working, crack a window; if you\u2019re free, follow the sun and keep it simple.",
