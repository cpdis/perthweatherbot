    "weather_report": "Bentley has spent the day under a clean, untroubled sky, and by late afternoon the light has softened from bright white to warm honey. It has been decidedly sunny, the sort of day where the UV would have bitten at midday, and while the edge has eased now, sunglasses and a touch of shade still feel sensible. The air reads as uncomplicated and clear, with distant details standing up crisply on the horizon. Expect the evening to stay fair and unclouded, the kind of simple weather that makes everything feel freshly washed. Dress in light layers; if you\u2019ll linger outdoors toward dusk, a thin long sleeve keeps the last rays polite. This is good weather for mundane pleasures: a slow walk to post a letter, watering the garden, hanging laundry, opening the windows to let the house breathe, or a small errand done on foot.",
