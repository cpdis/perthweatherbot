    "weather_report": "As the night gently wraps around Downtown San Francisco, a damp chill lingers in the air, heralding the arrival of rain that is set to intensify as dawn approaches. With a forecast that promises a steady downpour, expect a muted palette outside, where clouds blanket the sky like a heavy quilt, cloistering the Golden Gate and the city\u2019s skyline in a shroud of gray. The streets, still washed in a soft sheen from the previous night\u2019s drizzle, will soon mirror the clouds, as the rain begins its rhythmic descent, inviting the unmistakable scent of wet earth to rise.\n\nAs Monday unfolds, the temperature will hover in the cool range, and the wind will pick up, whispering through the avenues with unrelenting gusts. A sturdy jacket is highly advisable, perhaps with a hat to fend off the rain while wandering through lively caf\u00e9s or exploring the rich tapestry of art",
