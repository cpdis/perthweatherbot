    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a quilt of broken cloud at midday, the sun slipping in and out like a drowsy lighthouse, lending the streets a soft, pewter sheen. Expect this patchwork light to carry through the afternoon and into early evening, with bright intervals and gentle shade rather than full, blazing sun. UV around the middle of the day is still likely moderate to high despite the gaps in cloud, then easing later, so a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen are wise. It feels like an easy day: clear enough for good views, softened by passing veils, pleasant rather than punishing. Dress in light layers and breathable fabrics; if you\u2019ll be out toward dusk, tuck a light sweater in your bag. Good hours for a meandering errand on foot, a late lunch at a caf\u00e9 window, or a quiet wander by the river where the light keeps changing and the afternoon never quite settles into glare.",
