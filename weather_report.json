    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco arrives washed in clear, honeyed light. The sky is spotless, the sort of crystalline blue that invites a long breath and an unhurried gaze. The sun still has a little bite to it, with the UV easing now but worth a hat and a dab of sunscreen if you linger outdoors. The light is softening by the minute, sharpening edges then letting them go, and the day feels open, calm, and forgiving.\n\nExpect the clarity to hold through sunset and slip into a lucid, starry evening. Dress for a gentle shift: cool shades and airy sleeves now, a light layer for later when the warmth thins. It\u2019s a good hour to water the garden, walk to pick up something simple for supper, sit on the veranda with a page or two, or open the windows and let the rooms trade their air with the night.",
