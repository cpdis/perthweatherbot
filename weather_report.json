    "weather_report": "As night drapes Downtown San Francisco, the air is cool and tinged with the hint of humidity typical for winter near the bay. The city sits beneath a mantle of mostly cloudy skies, the clouds softly lit by the scattered glow of urban life beneath them. Temperatures hover around a mild fifty degrees, inviting a light layer for comfort against the gentle northwest breeze that whispers through the streets.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the forecast promises a shift to mostly sunny skies, though the warmth will be a gradual embrace, peaking near sixty degrees before descending to the coolness of the afternoon. It will be a day when nature takes a breath, the sun illustrating the city's iconic landmarks with vibrant light, while the subtle marine layer lingers, likely inviting a sigh of relief for those who thrive in cooler climes. As one considers outdoor pursuits, a casual stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, perhaps sampling a warm drink, will blend harmoniously with the unfolding day. Light layers will best suit the fluctuations of temperature, allowing for both comfort in chillier moments and ease as the sun begins to unveil its radiance.",
