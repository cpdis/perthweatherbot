    "weather_report": "Daybreak in Katy arrives with a swept-clean sky and that quiet, golden clarity that makes the neighborhood feel newly minted. The air starts on the cool side, but the sun will take the reins quickly; by midmorning to noon, expect bright, unobstructed sunshine and an open, cobalt dome. UV exposure will be modest at first, trending to moderate by late morning, so sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen are wise companions. Visibility looks crisp, the kind of clear day where edges are sharp and colors feel honest.\n\nIt\u2019s a light-layers morning: a sweater or thin jacket now, easy to peel to a comfortable shirt as the day warms. With the sky so faithful, it\u2019s a good time for a porch coffee, a meandering dog walk, or a calm loop around the block before errands. Wash the car without fear of surprise drizzle, tend to the porch plants, or browse a grocery aisle while the sun does its steady work. Pleasant, simple, and bright, the day invites unhurried tasks and a bit of sun on your face.",
