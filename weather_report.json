    "weather_report": "Before sunrise, Subiaco sits under a quilt of broken cloud, the sky a blue-slate with narrow rents where morning light will sift through. Expect a mottled morning rather than a blaze; the sun likely to slip in and out, soft at first, then more insistent as the hours unspool. UV is low now but will rise briskly once the sun clears the rooflines, even with passing cloud, so plan for shade and a modest touch of sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger outdoors. The air feels mild, the light muted, visibility good but not sparkling. Dress in easy layers: a breathable top and a light jacket for the early chill, with sunglasses and a hat ready for the breaks. This is a morning for a quiet walk to the shops, a check on the herbs, a calm commute or a small errand run while the light stays gentle.",
