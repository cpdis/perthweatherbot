    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the weather reveals a sharp contrast to the city\u2019s usual fog-laden days. A gentle warmth embraces the sky, with a high reaching the mid-fifties, despite descending temperatures into the afternoon. The air is crisp yet buoyant, not burdened by clouds, inviting you to step outside and feel the invigorating breeze from the west-northwest. Any lingering drizzle has dissipated, leaving behind a bright tableau characterized by the clear outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge framed against the skyline and the bay, glistening with a quiet beauty.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect a shift toward clarity, with the night settling in around 42 degrees. The north-northwest winds will subtly rustle, offering a sense of refreshing coolness. This creates a perfect opportunity for a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps enjoying a coffee al fresco at one of the many enticing caf\u00e9s. Layering is key today; opt for a light jacket over a cozy sweater to navigate the transition from sunlit afternoons to the calm, serene evenings that define the city by the bay. It\u2019s a lovely day to lose track of time amidst the city\u2019s vibrant rhythms and gentle whispers of the wind.",
