    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the air feels rinsed and quiet, a clear sky waiting for the first wash of light to climb the rooftops. Forecasts through early morning call for cloudless blue, the sort of crystalline start that sharpens edges and lengthens shadows. Expect a bright, sun-forward day with excellent visibility; as the sun climbs, the UV will rise quickly and likely become very strong by late morning, even if the breeze tricks you into thinking otherwise.\n\nIt will feel gentle now and increasingly warm as the morning unfolds. Dress in light layers you can shed, with breathable fabrics, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and sunscreen if you\u2019re out beyond breakfast. This looks like a day for modest pleasures: an early stroll to a caf\u00e9 while the streets are still yawning awake, watering the garden before the heat bites, hanging a wash to let the sky do the drying, or running a few small errands on foot while the light is kind. Save the longer outdoor errands for earlier or later; let midday be for shade, a book, and a cool glass of water.",
