    "weather_report": "As the clock silently ticks past 2 a.m., Subiaco slumbers under a tapestry of broken clouds, a patchwork quilt in the night sky obscuring the stars with gentle indifference. The lack of sunlight at this hour yields the soft embrace of darkness, a cloak comforting enough for deep thoughts or serene sleep. As dawn approaches, the forecast promises the continued presence of these broken clouds, casting intermittent shadows upon the winding streets and verdant parks, creating a mysterious allure to the waking world.\n\nWith limited exposure to direct sunlight, the UV index likely takes a modest, almost humble form, whispering of safe embraces without the need for intense protection. The muted light calls for attire that balances comfort and charm\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater paired with jeans, or a light jacket for those who feel the crisp edges of the early morning air.\n\nThe day ahead, draped in the subtle drama of a cloud-streaked sky, offers a canvas rich with possibilities. Take a contemplative stroll along the leafy avenues, each step rhythmic and deliberate, or perhaps find solace in a quiet caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee melds with soft background chatter. The gentle murmur of the town invites residents into its cadence, promising a day that feels both gentle and grounding, where simple pleasures reign supreme and introspection comes as naturally as breathing.",
