    "weather_report": "West Perth steps into the late morning under a clean, enamel-blue sky, the sun already sure of itself and the air feeling tidy and uncomplicated. Expect the day to stay bright and cloudless, with that high-definition clarity that sharpens edges and turns windows into mirrors. By midday the UV will climb to moderate or even high, so sunglasses, a hat, and a little sunscreen are wise; the warmth in direct sun will feel honest, while the shade stays comfortable. Light layers and breathable fabrics suit the moment, perhaps with a spare layer for an indoor chill.\n\nThis is the sort of day that rewards simple plans: open the windows and let the rooms breathe, walk to your errands instead of driving, or take a quiet lap through Kings Park\u2019s paths before lunch. A coffee on a shaded terrace, a chapter of a book by a bright window, a load of washing on the line, or a gentle spin to the shops will all feel right. The afternoon looks equally clear, with long, neat shadows and a sky that never quite loses its polish.",
