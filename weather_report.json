    "weather_report": "Midnight settles softly over Katy, the sky mostly clear after a bright, clean noon and a late-afternoon sweep of scattered clouds. Sunlight earlier was generous without bite, the sort that warms a windshield and leaves the UV index modest for winter; now it\u2019s dropped to nothing, and the night feels unhurried and transparent, stars slipping through the thinner patches.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant, easy night: cool enough for long sleeves or a light jacket, maybe a soft sweater if you linger. Good weather for a quiet lap around the block, to set out the bins, to listen to the hush between streetlights, or to stand in the driveway and count the constellations you still remember. If you\u2019re up late, brew something gentle and let the stillness work on you; tomorrow will come soon enough.",
