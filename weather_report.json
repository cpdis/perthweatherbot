    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, a soft, showery veil hushes the streets and lays a gentle sheen on the footpaths. The forecast keeps light rain in the picture through the early morning, with low cloud muting any hint of sunrise and keeping the UV modest to minimal at first. As the day lifts, expect a mostly grey canvas with occasional lighter patches; if a few shy breaks appear later, the sun will feel brighter than it looks, but for now the light stays silvery and subdued and visibility a touch softened by drizzle.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for comfort and patience: a light layer under a rain shell, shoes that won\u2019t flinch at puddles, and perhaps a small umbrella for the uneven showers. If you\u2019re up at this hour, let the morning amble along\u2014brew something warm, read a chapter, stretch by a window, then wander to a bakery once the rain slackens. Later, errands and a quick train into town will be fine between spits; a museum, a quiet caf\u00e9, or a lazy circuit through the market aisles suits the mood. Keep sunscreen in your bag just in case the sky relents after midday, but expect a calm, grey-tinged day that asks you to move a little slower.",
