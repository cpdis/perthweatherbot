    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a clear, blue-velvet evening. The day has thinned into gentle air and steady visibility, no haze, no mischief in the clouds, just a clean dome overhead as the last color drains westward. The sun was generous this afternoon and the UV would have bitten without care, but by now the index is near nil; the light is kind, and the first stars are starting to speak.\n\nThe forecast stays simple and pleasing: clear through the evening and into the night, the kind of weather that asks little and gives calm in return. Expect a comfortable feel early on, edging cooler as late night arrives. Dress for ease\u2014a light shirt now, with a cardigan or scarf at hand if you linger. This is good weather for an unhurried circuit of the neighborhood, for picking up a few bits from the corner shop, for watering the plants and letting the house breathe, or for a quiet sit on the balcony with a book, watching the sky deepen.",
