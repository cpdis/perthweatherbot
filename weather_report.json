    "weather_report": "As the night stretches on in Downtown San Francisco, the air remains crisp and refreshing, with temperatures settling comfortably around 46 degrees. The gentle breeze from the south-southwest, barely stirring at three miles per hour, adds a subtle touch to the serene atmosphere. Tomorrow promises to greet the city with sun-drenched rays, warming into the mid-fifties by afternoon. For those wandering the streets, expect clarity with a few lingering wisps of fog over the Bay, hinting at the recent marine influence lingering around the edges of the day. \n\nTo fully embrace the pleasant but cool weather, consider layering a light jacket over a comfortable sweater; this will allow for versatility as the sun climbs higher and the winds pick up slightly by noon. The golden glow of the sun invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront, perhaps indulging in a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 with a view, or exploring the unique shops of the area. Opting for a more leisurely afternoon, one could easily find solace in the small parks scattered about, perfect for soaking in the gentle warmth while watching the city unfold in its splendid tranquillity.",
