    "weather_report": "Burswood has slipped into a damp, reflective evening. Light rain through the afternoon and toward dusk has left pavements gleaming and the river dark and glassy, with clouds sealing off any late blush of sun. UV is essentially nil now, and even earlier it would have been modest at best under the blanket of cloud. The air feels gently cool and a touch humid; visibility is serviceable but softened by misty droplets and the watercolor halo of streetlights.\n\nDress for nuisance rather than hardship: a light waterproof layer, closed shoes, and an umbrella if you dislike fine spray. It\u2019s a night that invites small, companionable errands, a quiet meal in a nearby nook, or a slow walk under awnings while the showers patter on. Pleasant in its calm way, if not bright\u2014more of a hushed epilogue to the day than a finale.",
