    "weather_report": "Adelaide eases into late afternoon under a soft, pewter sky, the light already thinning and the air smelling faintly of wet stone. Sunshine will be scarce, filtered and brief if it peeks through at all, with the UV sitting low now and staying modest overall. Clouds will thicken toward evening, and light rain is set to arrive around dusk and linger into the night, the kind that beads on sleeves and makes the streets shine. The day feels gentle rather than harsh, a little dull at the edges, with visibility fine but the horizon smudged by grey.\n\nDress for a patient drizzle: a light waterproof layer, long sleeves, and shoes that won\u2019t mind puddles; carry a small umbrella for the unhurried showers. With daylight ebbing, it\u2019s a good time for small, ordinary comforts: a short walk before the rain settles in, then a pause at a quiet cafe, or a tidy-up at home while something simple simmers on the stove. If you\u2019re commuting, leave a few extra minutes for damp footpaths and low contrast. Tonight looks like the kind of rain that encourages conversation to soften and plans to slow, without demanding anything dramatic in return.",
