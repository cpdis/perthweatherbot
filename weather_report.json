    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate haze begins to lift, revealing glimpses of a mostly sunny day ahead. There is an intimate interplay of light among the buildings and streets, with the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge emerging softly in the distance. The temperature, a gentle reminder of the city's maritime chill, hovers around a pleasant 62 degrees, gradually yielding to a cooler 57 by the afternoon, inviting a shift from the retreating warmth of the sun. A subtle north-northwest breeze brushes through, promising an invigorating freshness beneath the vast sky.\n\nTonight, the city will settle into a cooler embrace, as temperatures dip to a comfortable 47 degrees under a canopy of partly clouded skies. The gentle south wind whispers through the streets, making it an ideal evening for a tranquil stroll along the waterfront or a cozy gathering at a local caf\u00e9, where warm drinks and contemplative conversations await. As the day evolves, one might choose to wrap up in a light sweater or jacket, perfectly suited for both the sunny daytime and the cool evening air. It\u2019s a day designed for exploring lesser-known nooks of the city or delighting in a leisurely afternoon of reading in a sunlit park, all while savoring the beauty of this iconic urban landscape.",
