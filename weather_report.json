    "weather_report": "Richmond wakes under a quilt of cloud, the morning light softened to a gentle pewter glow. The air feels crisp and clean, the kind that sharpens edges and keeps the world quiet for a beat. Visibility is good; rooftops and bare branches stand in fine relief against a mottled sky.\n\nAs the day stirs, the clouds should loosen, breaking into a friendlier patchwork with moments of honest sun by early afternoon. Expect a day that feels cool and steady, more companionable than dramatic. UV is low this time of year, though a pair of sunglasses will still be kind to the eyes when the sun slips through. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light or medium coat, a soft scarf if you run chilly, and shoes ready for unhurried steps. It\u2019s a good day for modest errands, a slow walk along a quiet block or river path, tidying a corner of the house, or reading by a window while the sky brightens and dims like someone thoughtfully adjusting a dimmer switch.",
