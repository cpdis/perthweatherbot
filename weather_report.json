    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into night under a varnished, cloudless sky; the late afternoon was bright and clean, with a gentle, unblinking sun that never felt harsh for long, and now the UV has fallen away to almost nothing. Visibility is crisp, colors are truer in the slanting light that just left, and the evening arrives with a quiet, steady clarity that makes the streets feel tidier than they were at noon.\n\nExpect the rest of tonight to stay serene and clear. It\u2019s pleasant in that unassuming way that asks only for a light layer\u2014an easy jacket or soft sweater if you linger outdoors. A small errand becomes a pleasure: a stroll to pick up bread, a slow loop past familiar windows, or a few minutes on the balcony letting the day\u2019s heat escape the stones. If you\u2019ve a mind for it, water the plants or write a quick note by the open window while the first stars come on; the air will do the rest.",
