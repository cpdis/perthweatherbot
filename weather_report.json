    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a veil of moisture creeps in, heralded by a chance of rain that dances on the cusp of dawn. The air, cool and still, whispers hints of what lies ahead, with temperatures nestling comfortably around a brisk 44 degrees. The atmosphere carries the promise of clouds, blanketing the city in a muted gray, accented by the subtle rustle of a northeast wind. The likelihood of rain increases as the clock inches toward the morning, with droplets expected to fall gently from the heavens, perhaps less than a whisper\u2014a mere prelude to the full symphony of rain that awaits the morrow.\n\nThursday looms ahead, shrouded in certainty; a relentless curtain of rain will drape the city throughout the day, accompanied by a steady, robust breeze. The temperature will dip slightly, making layers an essential choice for the day. A cozy sweater or a light jacket will serve well against the chill, and a sturdy umbrella will be your faithful companion in the inevitable downpour. With the streets glistening from the rain, one might relish the quieter moments indoors\u2014a steaming cup of coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9 watching the life of the city ripple by blurred through fogged windows. Alternatively, a stroll under the cover of an umbrella can reveal the beauty of a rainy cityscape, transforming familiar streets into a soft watercolor of grays and greens, where the everyday magic of San Francisco gently unfolds.",
