    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the streets are rinsed and quiet, the kind of light rain that softens edges and hushes the bins in the laneway. Showers are likely to loiter through the morning, with a chance of brighter gaps later as the day shakes itself awake. Sunshine will be fleeting at first, then more insistent if the cloud thins; even with a milky sky the UV will rise quickly by late morning, so don\u2019t be fooled by the grey. The air feels clean rather than cold, visibility decent but with a gentle haze, pavements slick and reflective like slate.\n\nDress for a damp start: light layers, a rain shell you can crumple into a bag, and shoes that won\u2019t mind puddles. A small umbrella will earn its keep on the walk to the shop or the station. It\u2019s a day for unhurried errands between showers, a coffee under an awning, or clearing a small corner of the house while the weather patters on. When the cloud lifts a little, take a short stroll and let the fresh, rain-washed morning do its quiet work\u2014with sunscreen in your pocket just in case.",
