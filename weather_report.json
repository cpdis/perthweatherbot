    "weather_report": "In the stillness of dawn, Downtown San Francisco rests beneath a shroud of patchy fog, a soft veil that whispers across the cityscape. The air is crisp, underscored by a pleasant chill as temperatures hover in the high 40s. Fog lingers gently, hinting at the night\u2019s retreat while promising a gradual unveiling of the urban panorama as the sun ascends. By mid-morning, patches of blue will begin to pierce through the marine layer, casting a muted radiance that highlights the city\u2019s architectural beauty. Expect a high near 58 degrees, though a subtle drop in temperature will accompany the afternoon\u2019s progression, leading to a comfortable coolness, perfect for a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s.\n\nAs you step outside, a light jacket may suffice, paired with layers to accommodate the transition from the brisk morning to a potentially sunnier afternoon. Enjoy the charm of the fog while it lasts; it provides a rare stillness and softness to the bustling streets, making it an ideal time to wander through hidden alleys adorned with murals, or to seek refuge in a bookshop with a warm drink. The day promises a pleasant mix of coastal mist and sunny intervals, an exquisite tapestry emblematic of this vibrant city.",
