    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a persistent veil of gray envelops the skyline, heralding a wet afternoon ahead. The promise of rain hangs thick in the air, punctuated by the occasional gust that rustles through the streets, stirring the fallen leaves. The temperature, once warmly inviting, feels muted, settling around 60 degrees as the clouds crowd in and dim the light. With precipitation looming at a near certainty, one might feel inclined to escape the damp chill by retreating indoors, perhaps to a cozy caf\u00e9 where conversation can flow as freely as the drizzles outside.\n\nAs night descends, the rain will intensify, draping the city in a cooler embrace with temperatures easing down to the mid-50s. The south-southeast winds whisper reminders to secure your umbrella and don waterproof layers. A calm evening in such conditions lends itself to indulging in the quiet joys of home\u2014curling up with a good book or perhaps experimenting with a comforting recipe in the kitchen. With visibility lessening under the weight of the fog and rain, consider wrapping yourself in a warm sweater, savoring the soft light of lamps illuminating your space while the world outside becomes a misty tableau.",
