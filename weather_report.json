    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Bassendean feels hushed and silvered, the sky turning to soft pewter as light rain noses in toward dusk. The sun is largely veiled now, with only a pale glow behind the cloud; UV has eased to the low end and will keep sliding as evening comes on. The air is mild and a touch damp, visibility good but edges smudged, as if the day has decided to speak in a quieter voice.\n\nExpect intermittent light showers from about now through the evening, more a steady patter than a downpour, with the odd lull for a breather. It\u2019s a gentle, if subdued, sort of pleasant: fine for those who like the streets darkening and the gardens grateful. A light waterproof or a short raincoat, breathable layers, and closed shoes will serve you well; tuck a small umbrella in your bag. Good choices this hour are modest ones\u2014an unhurried grocery run, a library return, tidying a corner of the shed, or a short walk between showers before putting a pot on to simmer and letting the windows fog a little.",
