    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Houston arrives with a soft, pewter light. The day opened with scattered, playful patches of sun, then settled under a thicker quilt of broken clouds by midday, leaving the sky textured and gently dim. Sunshine is filtered now, the glare softened; the UV is low at this hour and was only modest at its peak earlier, the sort that warms the skin without ever feeling sharp. The air carries a seasonable coolness for December, calm and a touch reflective, with visibility good and the horizon slightly smudged by cloud edges rather than haze.\n\nExpect the rest of the day to linger in this subdued, mostly cloudy mood as sunset edges closer. It\u2019s pleasant in an understated way: good for light layers\u2014a soft sweater or a light jacket\u2014and comfortable shoes. If you\u2019ve got a few minutes, a quiet walk before dinner suits the moment, or a quick run to pick up a library hold, or a coffee sipped by a window while the light thins. Outdoor plans are easy to keep without worry, just don\u2019t count on much sun; indoors, it\u2019s a fine time to straighten a room, simmer something simple on the stove, or catch up on a phone call. The sky won\u2019t dazzle, but it\u2019s steady and kind, a gray-blue companion to an unhurried late-day.",
