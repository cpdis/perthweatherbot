    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with an easy calm. The sky is largely open, only a few clouds expected to drift in by late evening and spread a touch toward the small hours, leaving generous gaps for stars and the soft hush of streetlights. The sun has bowed out, so there\u2019s no sting in the air; the UV index is essentially nil until morning returns. It feels like a pleasant night to linger, the kind that carries the last warmth of the day without demanding much in return.\n\nExpect a mostly clear, quietly agreeable overnight. Dress lightly, but carry a thin layer if you plan to stay out past midnight when the air can nibble at bare arms. This is good weather for a slow stroll beneath the jacarandas, a late tram ride with a book, or an unhurried chat on a balcony with the windows open. If you\u2019ve errands to run or a dog to walk, the air\u2019s clarity makes simple routines feel almost ceremonial, and the city hums along at a comfortable murmur.",
