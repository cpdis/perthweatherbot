    "weather_report": "The streets of Downtown San Francisco envelop you in a shroud of gray this afternoon, with rain cascading from the sky in a steady, unyielding rhythm. A brisk south wind dances through the alleyways, carrying whispers of distant fog that gathers like a ghost along the bay. Highs linger around the mid-50s, but the temperature will slightly descend as the afternoon wears on. The chance of precipitation is absolute, embracing the city in a wet embrace, as if it were a forgotten love returning after a lengthy absence. \n\nAs daylight wanes, a chance of rain persists into the night, accompanied by the soft murmur of clouds overhead. A light breeze will continue its gentle play, urging you to wrap yourself in layers of warmth\u2014perhaps a cozy waterproof jacket and sturdy boots would serve you well today. For those seeking solace from the weather, the local caf\u00e9 around the corner with warm pastries calls, inviting you to sip a steaming cup of coffee while watching the world outside blur through raindrops. Or, if the weather doesn\u2019t deter your adventurous spirit, a stroll under an umbrella along the waterfront may reveal the quiet charm of the bay, with the Golden Gate Bridge veiled in soft mist.",
