    "weather_report": "Morning in Waco comes on clear and unhurried, the sky mostly open with only a few feathery clouds left from the night. Light spills cleanly across streets and rooftops, the air looking crisp and visibility sharp, the kind of clarity that makes distant lines stand out. Expect a bright day with scattered high clouds at most; no hint of storminess, just winter sun working steadily. The UV should stay on the gentle-to-moderate side for December, stronger toward midday but not harsh.\n\nDress in easy layers: a soft sweater or light jacket for shade, with sleeves you can push up when the sun warms a bit. Sunglasses will be useful, and a touch of sunscreen if you linger outside. It\u2019s pleasant weather for small tasks and quiet movement\u2014walk to pick up a coffee instead of driving, air out a room and let the light do its slow housekeeping, thumb through books at the library, or take a short loop through the neighborhood to clear the mind before lunch.",
