    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun bathes the city in a gentle golden light, casting clarity over the urban landscape. With a high temperature settling near 64, the day gifts us a refreshing chill alongside a westerly breeze, making the air feel just a touch crisper. The marine layer that often cloaks the Bay is nowhere to be found; instead, it allows a breathtaking view towards the Golden Gate, the hills framing the city standing sentinel, their outlines sharp against the vivid blue sky.\n\nAs evening approaches, the temperature will ease down to a comfortable low of around 52. The evening sky will transform into a canvas of soft clouds, partially obscuring the stars while still offering glimpses of the fading light. A light jacket or sweater is the perfect companion for those planning to wander the streets or dine al fresco. As you stroll, perhaps consider visiting a local caf\u00e9 or indulging in a leisurely book on a bench in one of the nearby parks, absorbing the tranquil ambiance this lovely day offers.",
