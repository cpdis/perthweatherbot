    "weather_report": "Before sunrise, Osborne Park sits under a clean, inky sky, the air calm and a little crisp, with stars still visible and the eastern horizon beginning to pale. The clarity is striking; you can almost hear the quiet. It feels like a gentle start that invites an unhurried breath before the day stirs.\n\nA clear, bright morning is on tap, with sunshine pouring in soon after dawn and staying steady. Expect the UV to climb quickly with the first strong light, growing quite assertive by late morning, so think light layers you can peel back, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. It looks like one of those simple, pleasant days best handled with small, useful rituals: an early walk while the streets are hushed, watering the garden before the glare hardens, hanging a wash to dry, cycling to pick up a few groceries, or opening the windows to let fresh air through while you clear a corner of the house. If you\u2019re out later, shade and a refillable bottle will serve you well.",
