    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco greets you with a brilliant tapestry of sunlight stretched across the cityscape, where the familiar silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge stands proud against a backdrop of azure skies. As the temperature hovers just above the tender warmth of 60 degrees, it's the kind of day that invites a stroll. The air is clear and crisp, a gentle northwest breeze adding just the right touch to keep the day feeling refreshing rather than stifling.\n\nAs evening draws near, expect a gentle transition into a mild night, with temperatures dipping to around 48 degrees. The sky, mostly devoid of clouds, should cradle the evening stars softly. With light winds softly whispering from the east-northeast, it\u2019s a perfect invitation for a comfortable jacket as you savor the tranquility that envelops the city. The absence of fog and the clarity of the day create an ideal setting for a leisurely walk along the waterfront, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the local parks, allowing the beauty of this vibrant city to wash over you in gentle waves.",
