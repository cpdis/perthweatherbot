    "weather_report": "Evening has slipped over Subiaco with a gentle hand: patches of cloud drifting across a calm, open sky, the last of the day\u2019s brightness already stowed away. The forecast keeps those scattered clouds loitering into the night, with no great drama expected. Sunshine earlier would have come in and out behind the curtain, and the UV would have had some bite in the afternoon, but at this hour it\u2019s spent and the air feels clear and unhurried, visibility easy and the night quietly breathable.\n\nDress lightly with a spare layer over the shoulder in case the breeze turns coy; comfortable shoes if you\u2019re stepping out. It\u2019s a good night for a slow dog walk, a short errand to the corner shop, watering balcony plants, or reading on the veranda while the street settles. If you need motion, a gentle spin around the block will do; if you need stillness, crack a window and let the night air file the edges off the day.",
