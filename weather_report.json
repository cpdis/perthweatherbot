    "weather_report": "Night has come to Subiaco with a quiet, open sky and just a few stray clouds sliding by; the stars feel accessible, the air unhurried. Sunshine is no longer in play and the UV index is essentially nil, leaving the evening clear-eyed and gentle rather than dazzling. It\u2019s a calm, breathable night, the sort that asks for unhurried steps and an easy pace.\n\nAs the hours drift on, cloud cover is expected to thicken into broader, broken patches, softening the moon and muting the horizon before dawn. Expect a filtered first light rather than a blaze; UV will stay low early, rising only once the morning gets going. A light layer or soft jumper will suit the late evening and the first hours of tomorrow. It\u2019s good weather for a slow lap around the block, for bringing in the washing, jotting tomorrow\u2019s list at the kitchen table, or stepping out to catch a brief window of stars between clouds before turning in.",
