    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a blue sky, kissed by the gentle warmth of the sun, with the temperature lingering just below sixty. As the hours pass, a subtle coolness drapes over the city, a reminder of the ocean's breath. The air, still and crisp, carries whispers of a potential rain, forecasted to arrive past the early hours. For those stepping outside, layers are advisable; a light jacket will ward off the afternoon chill as temperatures dip toward fifty-seven.\n\nAs the day rolls on, one might find solace in a quiet walk along the waterfront. The afternoon promises a chance of rain after sleep's embrace, but for now, the city stands clear, inviting contemplation and ease. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 could provide the perfect respite, offering warmth and reprieve from fleeting clouds that may soon drift over. Enjoying this interlude before evening's promise of raindrops pan down upon the pavement will make the day feel luxuriant, and remind us that every San Francisco day holds its own kind of charm.",
