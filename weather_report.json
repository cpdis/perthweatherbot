    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night gives way to a splendid Thanksgiving morning, where a tapestry of stars has taken its leave, yielding to the gentle glow of dawn. The atmosphere stands clear, a refreshing promise with temperatures retreating to a crisp 44 degrees. The northeast winds whisper quietly, hinting at comfort and warmth beneath the sun's embrace. As daylight unfurls, the city lights gradually dim, revealing the contours of the iconic skyline kissed by blue skies.\n\nAs the hours pass, a sunny day unfolds, coaxing the temperatures to rise towards 58, before settling back to a cozy 55 in the afternoon. There is no trace of fog in sight, a rare delight for this coastal enclave. The clarity remains unbroken, allowing for breathtaking vistas from iconic spots, perfect for a gentle stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee at an al fresco caf\u00e9. Dress in layers; a light sweater or jacket will be your companion as the breeze carries a hint of coolness, while later hours may invite you to shed it for a more relaxed attire, basking in the gentle warmth of the sun. Today, consider a thoughtful wander through the city's storied streets, perhaps a visit to a local market or an art gallery, savoring the serene moments that Thanksgiving brings.",
