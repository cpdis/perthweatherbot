The serene wisp of a wind from the west southwest blesses the night with a gentle touch. As dawn breaks, Friday will unveil a canvas of muted sunlight, where temperatures flirt with 55 degrees before retreating to a cooler afternoon chill near 52. The winds, mild and playful, will dance between 2 to 7 mph, encouraging everything from casual strolls to leisurely afternoons in the city's charming nooks.\n\nGlimmers of fog may linger softly along the edges; the defining marine layer offering a delicate veil over the city. As one gazes thoughtfully across the expanse, the clarity of the day feels inviting yet carries whispers of warmth intertwined with the coolness of winter. In dressing for this temperate day, layers will be your ally\u2014perhaps a light sweater beneath a stylish jacket, suitable for both the briskness of the morning and the allure of a crisp afternoon. With these conditions, a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s for a quiet reflection over a steaming cup or an exploratory walk along the waterfront will offer solace amidst the urban pulse, perfect for an unhurried Friday unfolding.",
