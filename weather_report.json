The air feels crisp, cool enough to invite a light jacket, especially as the chill of the night lingers. You can anticipate a high hovering close to sixty, with a gradual dip to fifty-seven by afternoon, accompanied by a breeze from the north-northeast, adding a refreshing touch to the morning. \n\nThe golden hues of early sun may wrestle with remnants of hazy marine layer, but any fog that lingers is likely to lift gracefully, revealing the city\u2019s vibrant hues as the day unfolds. It\u2019s shaping up to be a pleasant start to the year; consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps followed by a quiet read in one of the inviting local coffee spots while you sip a warm drink. The atmosphere encourages possibilities\u2014each moment, a chance to embrace the serene beauty of the city as it awakens.",
