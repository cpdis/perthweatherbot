    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a gentle, lucid sky: the last of the daylight has folded away, leaving only a few harmless clouds drifting into a clean, open night. The air feels honest and dry, visibility crisp, and the UV has ebbed to nothing; whatever bite the sun had earlier is now a memory. Through late evening the patchy cloud thins, and after that it\u2019s plain sailing under clear stars, the kind of clarity that makes streetlights look a little sharper and sound carry a little farther.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant night to be unhurried. A light layer or soft long-sleeve will do, maybe a cardigan if you plan to linger, and no need for sunscreen now. Take an easy stroll to clear the head, water the garden while the air is cool, or sit on the balcony with a simple supper and let the day unspool. If you\u2019ve errands to tie up, the calm will help you move through them without fuss; if not, open a window and let the quiet do its work.",
