    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle coolness drapes over the city, with temperatures settling around 44 degrees. The air remains still, touched only by a whispering breeze from the north, inviting a leisurely stroll through the quieter streets lined with the soft, warm glow of street lamps. Tonight reveals a tapestry of partly cloudy skies, where hints of blue and patches of starlight flit between wisps of cloud, creating a serene backdrop for nocturnal musings. \n\nLooking ahead to M.L. King Jr. Day, the sun will grace the city with its warmth, promising a high of nearly 60 degrees. This brightness will transform the atmosphere, compelling residents to shed layers as the afternoon approaches, though a refreshing northeast wind will occasionally punctuate the warmth, reminding all of the Pacific\u2019s playful influence. Expect clarity in the skies, allowing for stunning views of the Golden Gate and beyond, with any lingering fog retreating to distant shores. Dress comfortably in layers to embrace the rising temperatures while being prepared for those crisp moments. Perhaps you might venture to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee, or wander through one of the city\u2019s many parks, enjoying the vibrant life that characterizes a sunny day in San Francisco.",
