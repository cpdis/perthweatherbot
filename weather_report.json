    "weather_report": "As the darkness of night fades into the early hours of this February morning, Downtown San Francisco finds itself enveloped in a symphony of rain and clouds. The air hangs cool and damp, whispering promises of moisture-rich skies, as resounding gusts of wind dance through the avenues, stirring every leaf and corner. With temperatures settling around the mid-fifties, this is not a morning for shorts or t-shirts; rather, it calls for coats and sturdy footwear. A water-resistant jacket, perhaps complemented by a snug scarf, will ensure comfort against the chill that lingers in the air, especially as one considers venturing out.\n\nAs day breaks, anticipation of the impending downpour looms heavily. Rain is inescapable, with an assertive 100% chance promising a soaking that will stir the city awake. The vision of fog rolling over the hills, coupled with the steady rhythm of raindrops against stainless steel and concrete, brings a certain charm to this urban landscape, albeit a somewhat somber one. It's the perfect backdrop for a cozy day tucked indoors, perhaps indulging in the rich embrace of a local caf\u00e9\u2019s freshly brewed coffee or immersing oneself in a good book while the world outside dances in the rain. Those braving the elements may find solace in quiet museums or galleries, places where the art can speak louder than the storm outside.",
