    "weather_report": "A muted dawn settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city cloaked in a gentle melancholy reminiscent of early winter. The air hangs cool, pregnant with the promise of rain, as an overcast sky looms above\u2014a heavy quilt of gray enveloping the horizon. The morning whispers of a slight chance of rain, yet there\u2019s an undeniable anticipation that lingers as the day progresses toward a high of 62 degrees, only to dip slightly as afternoon gives way to evening. \n\nBy nightfall, the mood shifts dramatically; rain is expected to drench the city between the hours of ten and four, transforming the streets into glistening ribbons woven through the bustling heart of the metropolis. Thunder rumbles softly in the distance, signaling the oncoming storms, while a vigorous wind stirs, reminding us of winter's presence. For those venturing outside, layering becomes essential\u2014a lightweight waterproof jacket accompanied by a cozy sweater should suffice. As the rain begins, consider savoring a local caf\u00e9's warmth or meandering through the quieter, adorned streets, where holiday lights twinkle against the gray backdrop. The air is crisp, charged with the sweetness of impending rain and the faint aroma of hearth fires; it\u2019s an invitation to find solace in the unhurried moments of a city that beautifully bears the brunt of the elements.",
