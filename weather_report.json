    "weather_report": "As night cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the air stirs gently with a whisper of coolness, draping the city in a mellow haze. The skies remain mostly cloudy, hinting at a tranquil low near fifty that invites intimate clothing\u2014perhaps a soft sweater or a light jacket to ward off the chill as the evening unfolds. While the clouds gather close, they do not present an oppressive blanket; rather, they provide a soft glow, allowing the city\u2019s lights to twinkle beneath their gentle embrace.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the sun will rise higher, teasing a promise of sunlit hours ahead with temperatures peaking near sixty-one. The blue will stretch across the sky, inviting those who crave a hint of warmth to step outside into a day that will blossom with visibility around the Golden Gate and beyond. The northwest breeze, light but consistent, suggests a pleasant outing\u2014maybe a stroll through the quieter streets or a cup of coffee enjoyed in a sunlit caf\u00e9. Keep an eye on the marine layer, for while it may linger early, it will graciously retreat, revealing the city\u2019s majestic contours in a dance of fleeting fog. For today, dress in layers, allowing for the morning cool that warms gently into the afternoon\u2019s embrace. San Francisco beckons with subtle charm; find pleasure in its quieter moments, perhaps browsing a nearby gallery or exploring a tucked-away bookstore, wrapped in the reassuring rhythm of a winter day.",
