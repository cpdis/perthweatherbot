    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco begins to stir, a gentle veil of patchy fog clings to the night, moving with the whispers of the north wind. The crystal chill lingers, holding on to the edges of the early morning. A soft fog rolls between the buildings, hinting at the day to come, while the temperature hovers at a cool 48 degrees. By the time the sun begins its ascent, this mist will likely give way to patches of sunshine, though the clouds will intermittently dance across the sky. As the afternoon sets in, expect a subdued high near 58 as temperatures gradually wane to 56\u2014an invitation for layered attire.\n\nThis day offers a serene backdrop for a gentle stroll along the Embarcadero, where one can absorb the romantic silhouette of the Bay Bridge under the soft light. Alternatively, a quiet visit to one of the city's cozy cafes, perhaps in North Beach, would be an ideal retreat to sip a warm drink while observing the ebb and flow of city life layered beneath the whimsical shifts of fog and sun. The weather is neither oppressive nor overly bright; it is a canvas that holds the potential to reveal beauty in its subtleties. Dress warmly in layers\u2014perhaps a soft scarf to ward off the chill\u2014and embrace the tranquil charm of a San Francisco day that, while muted, is far from dull.",
