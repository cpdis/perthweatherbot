    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the skies remain clear, a canvas of darkness punctuated by the soft glimmers of city lights. The temperature dips to a brisk 42 degrees, lending a sharpness to the air that beckons for a cozy layer. A gentle north-northwest wind whispers through the streets, its mild caress providing a hint of chill but nothing that can't be combated with a light jacket or sweater. Tonight's tranquility feels like the calm before the bustle of a sunny Sunday.\n\nTomorrow heralds a day marked by sunshine, the kind that warms the skin while gently cooling the spirit. With highs peaking near 55 degrees, a slow descent into the low 50s unfolds as afternoon progresses. As the sun arcs overhead, the clarity of the day invites outdoor pursuits; perhaps a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely coffee at a corner caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a drink can mirror the friendship of conversation. The light north winds will only enhance the experience, perfect for hats or light scarves to ward off the early morning chill. As the sun sets on this vibrant scene, one can savor the transition from day to night, the cityscape illuminated by the fading light and the lives that pulse within it.",
