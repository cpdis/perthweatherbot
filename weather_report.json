    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits in a hush after midnight, the sky thinly veiled and the air cool and a little damp. A few clouds roam now, with light rain likely brushing through near first light, the kind that beads on railings and softens the streets. Sunshine will be shy to start; if the clouds fissure later, it will come in gentle shards rather than a blaze. UV is negligible overnight and low at dawn; should the sun break through later in the morning, the spring light can still nip at bare skin. Expect a subdued, slightly misted clarity early on, more pewter than silver.\n\nDress for a soft, wet start: light layers with a small waterproof or an umbrella, closed shoes, sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen tucked in case the day opens up. It\u2019s a good hour for an unhurried coffee and a quiet read while the showers shuffle past, then a short walk to the bakery between drizzles, or a tidy-up at home with the windows cracked to the cool. If the sky brightens later, let a lazy errand or a loop around the nearest park be the day\u2019s modest victory.",
