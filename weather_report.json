    "weather_report": "This morning, Downtown San Francisco greets you with an embrace of sunlight, a promise of clarity in the air as you stand among the gentle hum of the city. With temperatures peaking near a crisp 54 degrees, the day hints at a pleasant harmony, while a gentle northwest breeze stirs, offering just enough coolness to invigorate the spirit. As the afternoon approaches, temperatures will dip slightly, settling around 52 degrees, but the allure of the sun remains, lacing the day with warmth through its rays, illuminating the iconic skyline and the distant embrace of the Golden Gate.\n\nAs night begins to weave its shadows after a day of brightness, expect a subtle shift in the weather. A slight chance of drizzle flirts on the horizon, likely after 4 AM, as the clouds gather and partially obscure the stars. The temperature will descend to a cozy 42 degrees, gradually rising to about 44 as the night envelops the city, with the wind shifting to a relaxed west-southwest direction. The marine layer teases its return, hinting at possible fog, yet during these daylight hours, the sky retains a commendable clarity, ideal for a jaunt beneath the sun. You might consider a light jacket in the evening, perfect for the potential chill, while a comfortable layered outfit allows for exploring the nooks and crannies of downtown or finding a peaceful spot to sip coffee and watch the city transition from day to night, savoring the quieter moments before the world stirs awake once more.",
