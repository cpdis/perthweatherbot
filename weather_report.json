    "weather_report": "Busselton wakes to a crystal-blue morning, the kind of clean, unblinking light that sharpens every edge and throws a white shimmer off water and pavement. Skies are set to stay clear through the early afternoon, so expect a sun-forward day with high glare and that dry, summery brightness that makes colors pop. With the season turning and no cloud cover to soften it, the UV will be very strong by midday; the day looks lovely but unforgiving if you linger in it too long.\n\nKeep it easy: light, breathable clothing, long sleeves if you can manage them, a wide-brim hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen, with a bottle of water tucked in your bag. Late morning suits a quiet coffee in the shade, a brief errand on foot, or a browse at the library while the sun hits its stride; save a longer wander along the foreshore or a gentle bike ride for later, when the light mellows and a coastal breeze takes the edge off.",
