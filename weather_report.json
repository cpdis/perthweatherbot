    "weather_report": "As night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the air settles coolly around 42 degrees, propped up by a gentle north-northwest breeze. The sky above is mostly clear, a canvas that promises clarity for the coming day. Tomorrow, the sun will rise, bathing the city in its January warmth, with a high nearly reaching 55 degrees\u2014comfortable for a stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the local parks, where the faint scent of earth still lingers from recent rains. \n\nThere\u2019s an unmistakable charm in the crispness of the evening air, and while fog may briefly flirt with the edges of the bay, it quickly yields to the night air, allowing stars to peek through the fabric of the urban sky. This is a fine time for a layered outfit, perhaps a light jacket over a fitted sweater, suitable for the coolness that teases the skin. Tomorrow invites opportunities for quiet contemplation at a caf\u00e9 or the simple joy of wandering through the streets, absorbing the lively yet relaxed spirit of this coastal enclave.",
