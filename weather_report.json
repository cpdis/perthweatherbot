    "weather_report": "Subiaco, with its theatre of clear skies, has once again staged a marvelous day for all. As the clock strikes 20:12, the evening unrolls, draped in a luxurious layer of serenity, finding its rhythm in the comforting embrace of tranquility after a day bathed in serene sunlight. There's a peaceful grace in the air, a harmony that whispers of a calm, cloudless day spent under the warmth of the sun with just the right kiss of light. \n\nThe temperament of the day appears to paint a pleasing canvass\u2014no sudden petulance in the guise of rain or wind. While the UV index has already taken its retire for the night, the day was one that beckoned for lighter clothing, where the air danced around one's skin in the comfort of cotton shirts or flowing sundresses. Truly, an amenable day to indulge in simple pleasures. A leisurely walk through the bustling streets of Subiaco would be the order of the day, or perhaps a delightfully unhurried cup of coffee in the glow of the setting sun. As we venture into the evening, the likeness of a thin cardigan would serve well the evening's prospect, a ceremonial homage to the gentle tug of the cool night air that is just beginning to seep in.",
