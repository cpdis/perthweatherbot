    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, the city grapples with the soft embrace of rain, a gentle reminder of nature\u2019s whims. The air is thick with promise, cloudy skies roiling with whispers of moisture. A southward wind carries fragrant hints of damp earth, rustling through the streets as the temperature hovers comfortably in the mid-fifties. Rainfall serenades the sidewalks, echoing the mood of a city steeped in introspection. The lingering shadows of the evening invite one to wrap in layers, perhaps donning a light raincoat and sturdy shoes for those who dare step outside.\n\nWith the dawn will come more rain, draping the Golden Gate in a mist that dances like a memory. The day promises to stick to its overcast narrative, with peaks barely brushing sixty, hinting at a slow descent into cooler air as the afternoon wears on. The marine layer will drape itself over familiar landmarks, softening the edges of the city\u2019s iconic skyline into dreamy silhouettes, a quiet allure for the contemplative soul. Consider the comfort of a caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a good book and the rich aroma of coffee can provide solace against the rain\u2019s rhythm. Alternatively, find a cozy nook in the library, where stories await beneath the soft glow of afternoon light, creating a peaceful retreat from the world.",
