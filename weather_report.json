    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the sky is clean and uncomplicated, stars thinning toward a pale seam in the east. It is clear now and set to stay clear, the kind of crystalline morning that sharpens edges and brightens courtyards, promising a day with hard, honest sunshine and little to hide it.\n\nExpect the sun to take charge quickly after sunrise; the UV index will climb rapidly into very high, even extreme, territory by late morning. Dress light and breathable, add a brimmed hat and dark glasses, and treat sunscreen and a water bottle as essentials rather than accessories. It looks like a pleasant day if you keep to the gentler hours: an unhurried walk to the bakery, a quick tidy of the garden while the shadows still run long, a load of washing that will dry in no time, or a ride to the shops before the glare sets in. By midday, retreat to the cool, catch up on reading or work indoors, then drift back out when the light softens again.",
