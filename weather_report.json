    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a restless atmosphere as rain begins to usher in a cooler embrace. The air feels heavy, pregnant with moisture, and the sound of rain reverberates against city streets. As you stand beneath the gray quilt of clouds, gusty winds whip through the avenues, rustling leaves and shaking branches in a lively dance. The low hangs nearly at 53 degrees, punctuated by gusts that can surprise with their force, reaching up to 51 mph. This is a night for warmth and protection; a heavy coat and perhaps waterproof boots will serve you well, accompanied by an umbrella to stave off the persistent drizzle that promises to deliver an inch or two before dawn.\n\nTomorrow promises a continuing adventure in weather, with early showers and thunderstorms expected to linger before the sun attempts a timid reappearance. The day won't be brisk but rather subdued, as the high struggles to break through the cloud cover, hovering around 58 degrees. Focused around the heart of the city, the view may be obscured, hinting at a thick marine layer lending the landscape a soft, muted quality. It's a perfect moment for a cozy caf\u00e9 visit, where you can enjoy a book as raindrops tap dance on the windows, or to explore the many art galleries nestled within the urban fabric, discovering the stories that each piece whispers in the half-light.",
