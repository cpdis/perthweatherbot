    "weather_report": "In the tender hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco is draped in a veil of cloud, the sky heavy with the promise of rain. Outside, the air feels damp and carries the sharp tang of the sea, beckoning from the undulating contours of the bay. The city is set to rouse in a hush, as the soft thrum of raindrops will soon echo against the pavement. Temperatures are nestled around a cool 54, urging the first stirrings of the day to seek solace in cozy layers. The persistent south wind, playfully gusting at intervals, makes its presence known, adding a brisk serenity to the morning air.\n\nAs the clouds deepen throughout the day, the inevitable touch of rain will envelop this vibrant metropolis. The high will nudge towards a cool 59, eventually giving way to a languid fall to 56 as the afternoon progresses. Dressing wisely means layering\u2014think a warm scarf and a dependable raincoat. This is the kind of day that calls for quiet contemplation; a walk through the raindrop-kissed streets could serve as a reprieve from the bustling rhythm of ordinary life. One might find delight in a local caf\u00e9, sipping on something warm while watching the world drift by through the window, or perhaps lose themselves in a good book at home, as the rhythmic patter of rain creates its own gentle symphony.",
