A soft blue sky stretches above, while the crisp air holds a whisper of the cooling marine layer, hinting at its presence over the Golden Gate. Yet, by the evening, a veil of clouds and drizzle will make its descent, transforming the serene atmosphere into one that invites the cozy embrace of shelter.\n\nWith temperatures drifting from a pleasant high of 60 down to a cooler 52 tonight, it\u2019s wise to opt for layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket to navigate the midday sun and a warmer layer for the impending evening chill. The winds will dance lightly, adding a subtle chill that might breeze past a wandering soul. As dusk approaches and the drizzle arrives, consider a stroll through the city\u2019s vibrant streets, perhaps stopping by a favored caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink while the city transforms under the moody, cloud-draped sky.",
