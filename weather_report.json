    "weather_report": "Before sunrise in Subiaco, the air feels clean and hushed, the sky an ink-blue canvas with the stars paling at the edges. It\u2019s cool enough for a light jacket, the kind of pre-dawn calm where footpaths echo and the smell of wet leaf and brick hangs in the dark. The horizon looks unmarred, promising a clear, lucid day; by breakfast the light will turn sharp and honest, shadows crisp, colors lifted.\n\nExpect a bright, cloudless morning and a steady, dry warmth as the day opens up. Sunshine will feel assertive, and the UV will rise quickly through mid-morning; a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen will serve you well once the light strengthens. Dress in easy layers you can shed\u2014breathable fabrics, sleeves you can roll\u2014and lean toward comfort that tolerates glare. It\u2019s a good day for small, unhurried tasks: a stroll to pick up bread before the streets heat, watering the garden while the shade still lingers, hanging a wash to dry in the honest breeze, or taking your coffee on a quiet bench where you can watch the town wake.",
