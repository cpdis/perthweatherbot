    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a simple, pleasing sky: mostly clear, a few clouds drifting like quiet thoughts. The day offered generous brightness with only thin interruptions, and it leaves behind clean lines on the horizon and good, steady visibility. UV is essentially gone now, a gentle zeroing-out after the stronger daylight hours you likely felt earlier. Expect the rest of the night to remain tranquil and mostly clear, the kind of air that carries sound softly and lets the neighborhood lights glow without a halo.\n\nFor comfort, think light layers: a soft shirt with a cardigan or a light jacket, something you can shrug off if you keep moving. It\u2019s a good night for small, ordinary pleasures\u2014an unhurried walk to return a library book, a lap around the block with the dog, a chat on the porch while the evening cool settles. If you\u2019ve chores to finish, open a window and let the calmness in; if not, step outside for a few minutes and look up, just to confirm the sky is indeed as uncomplicated as it feels.",
