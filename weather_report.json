    "weather_report": "As the new year dawns in Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a gentle hush. Tonight's parting clouds yield to a delicate clarity, inviting quiet contemplation beneath a star-specked sky. The temperature rests coolly, yet comfortably, around 46 degrees, caressed by a soft northwesterly breeze\u2014ideal for a light jacket or a cozy sweater as you step outside into the calm of midnight revelry waiting to unfold. \n\nOn New Year's Day, the promise of mostly sunny skies hangs in the air, with the thermometer nudging toward a high of 56 degrees in the afternoon. A clean horizon reveals glimpses of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, suggesting the absence of the usual fog that often blankets the bay. The calmness of the day encourages a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps followed by a warm drink from one of the nearby caf\u00e9s, where you can savor the moment, reflecting on resolutions while soaking in the vibrant atmosphere around you. Remember to dress in layers to adapt to the soft afternoon chill, and allow the day to unfold at its own pace, a subtle celebration of new beginnings.",
