    "weather_report": "Night still clings to Katy at this quiet hour, the sky quilted with lingering broken clouds that soften the last streetlights and hush the stars. It feels cool and calm, the air a muted blue, with no bite from the sun and a UV index at rest. The world is blurred at the edges, the kind of predawn that invites a slower breath and a hand around a warm mug.\n\nAs the day stirs, expect a mostly cloudy canvas with occasional sun slipping through in gentle intervals rather than a blaze\u2014bright enough for a lift, not enough for glare. UV should stay modest unless the clouds thin longer than expected. It looks like a generally pleasant, low-contrast day: easy on the eyes, good for simple errands and unhurried routines. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light jacket or soft sweater over a tee\u2014and comfortable shoes; sunglasses only if the sky opens. Consider a short walk after sunrise when the light turns pewter to pearl, a grocery run before lunch, or a tidy-up on the porch while the air stays mild and unbothered.",
