    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the day with a gentle, partly cloudy sky. Overnight temperatures dipped into the cool embrace of the low forties, but expect a gradual warming as the sun rises, casting its rays over the iconic skyline. While the morning carries a refreshing bite in the air, particularly with the gentle north-northeast breeze whispering at near ten miles per hour, it\u2019s poised to rise to a comfortable sixty degrees by midday. \n\nToday promises a sun-drenched afternoon, with the winds intensifying, potentially reaching gusts of up to twenty-four miles per hour. Although visibility appears largely unhindered, one can sense the remnants of a marine layer, clinging delicately to the horizon, perhaps suggesting a slight haze over the bay. Dress in layers, opting for light yet durable attire; a light jacket will keep the chill at bay while still allowing for comfort as the sun warms the air. This delightful, though brisk day invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quiet moments in one of the city\u2019s many parks, where the lush greenery meets artful architecture. It\u2019s an opportune day for savoring an outdoor caf\u00e9, sharing casual conversations, or losing oneself in a good book under the twinkling sun.",
