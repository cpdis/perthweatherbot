    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a shroud of cloud cover cloaks the skyline, a harbinger of the rain that will embellish the night with a gentle rhythm. Presently, the air feels cool and damp, hovering around a mild 51 degrees. With a steady south-southeast wind whispering through the city at around 7 to 12 miles per hour, it carries the scent of impending rain, ensuring that those outside are met with a damp embrace. As darkness settles in, visibility wanes, and the 90% chance of precipitation promises to transform the streets into reflective ribbons, alive with the glow of city lights against the moist backdrop.\n\nTomorrow, the rain will persist through the daylight hours, the clouds thickening to weave a somber canvas overhead, while temperatures attempt to rise to the mid-50s. Those braving the elements should consider a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear, ideally suited for an adventure through puddled streets. As the rain taps rhythmically against rooftops, one might take solace in the comfort of a cozy caf\u00e9, indulging in a warm drink while watching the world glisten outside. Alternatively, the intimate glow of a local bookstore could offer refuge, beckoning with its promise of a good read as the city dances under a veil of rain and shadow.",
