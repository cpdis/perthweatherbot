    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Osborne Park arrives under scattered clouds, the sun sliding westward between soft gaps and giving the streets a warm, dappled glow. The sky feels open and honest, with just enough cloud to soften the glare; the UV is easing but still has a little bite until the day leans toward twilight. Expect more of the same into evening: broken cloud, dry air, and clear views, the light mellowing to a calm, honeyed hush. It reads as a pleasant, unhurried spell. Dress light and breathable now, with a hat and a whisper of sunscreen if you\u2019re out before dusk, and keep a soft layer handy for when the warmth drifts off. Good hours for modest comforts: a stroll to the shops, watering the garden, a tidy of the front step, or an easy loop with the dog as the day exhales.",
