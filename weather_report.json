    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Katy, the sky is scrubbed clean and still, a quiet lid of darkness where even small stars feel unbothered. The afternoon that preceded it ran bright and uncomplicated under a clear blue ceiling; the sun would have felt frank and unfiltered, with the UV bite strongest around lunchtime and fading gently toward evening. Now the air trims its warmth and sharpens at the edges, and visibility feels as open as a long, empty road.\n\nFor what remains of the night, expect a settled, transparent mood. It\u2019s pleasant in a low-key, restorative way: light layers will do in the daytime, but keep a sweater or light jacket for late errands; sunglasses by midday and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger outside. Good hours for small, ordinary rituals\u2014a slow dog walk, airing out a room, setting tomorrow\u2019s coffee, or a brief step into the yard to breathe and look up.",
