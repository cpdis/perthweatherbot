    "weather_report": "The morning greets Downtown San Francisco with a heavy shroud of rain and cloud, characterized by a persistent drizzle that fills the air with a palpable chill. The temperature hovers in the upper 50s, yet it feels even cooler with the accompanying winds whispering from the south. Today\u2019s landscape, a blend of gray skies and fog, exacerbates the melancholy often felt in winter, as visibility dips and the golden shimmer of the Golden Gate Bridge is obscured behind low-hanging clouds and the persistent marine layer draping the city.\n\nAs night falls, the rain is expected to recede slightly, but a lingering chance of showers remains possible before 10 PM, leaving behind a cool, damp chill that envelops the streets. Dressing appropriately is essential; layering is recommended, perhaps a cozy sweater under a waterproof jacket, accompanied by sturdy shoes to navigate the slick sidewalks. Given the drizzly ambiance, one might choose to indulge in a quiet afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while watching the world blur by, or explore the many independent shops scattered throughout the neighborhood, which may offer a welcome refuge from the gloomy weather.",
