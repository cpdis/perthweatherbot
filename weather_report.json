    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco finds itself under a serene, partly cloudy sky, with the chill of the evening setting in gently around a low of 48 degrees. Winds from the west-northwest whisper softly through the streets, providing just enough movement to stir the crisp air. As you glance out, a marine layer lingers discreetly near the coast, creating a soft veil that slightly dulls the lights of the city but adds a hushed charm to the panorama.\n\nLooking ahead to Washington's Birthday, expect a dance of sunshine with a high reaching near 57. The warmth will gradually fade to a cooler 55 as the day draws on. With a gentle breeze of 5 to 10 mph, it promises to be both inviting and refreshing, perfect for a leisurely stroll. Dressing in layers will serve you well; a light sweater paired with a jacket will keep you comfortable as the temperatures shift. On this day, consider venturing through the vibrant corridors of local shops or savoring a quiet moment in one of the nearby parks, soaking in the interplay of warmth and coolness as the day unfolds slowly and beautifully.",
