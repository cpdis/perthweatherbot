    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks closer to the dawn of a new year, Downtown San Francisco resides under a velvety cloak of night, the low hum of the city\u2019s heart pulsing softly beneath a partly cloudy sky. The forecast hints at a transition towards a pleasantly sunny New Year's Day, with temperatures that will flirt with the mid-fifties, urging us to shed layers as the day unfolds. For now, though, cool breezes waft through the streets, inviting residents to wrap themselves in light sweaters or jackets, perhaps pairing them with a cozy scarf to fend off any chill.\n\nTomorrow promises bright blue skies, a welcome sight for the start of the year, yet this evening casts a momentary spell of calm, illuminated by the city lights aglow. While fog may not blanket the iconic hills and bridges this night, a faint whisper of a marine layer lingers just beyond, reminiscent of the ocean\u2019s embrace. It would be wise to seize this moment, perhaps with a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a contemplative hour in a favorite caf\u00e9, as the city prepares to celebrate new beginnings amidst the lingering charm of the San Francisco night.",
