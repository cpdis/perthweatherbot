    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Centennial Park with a calm, mostly clear sky and only a few timid clouds lingering from the afternoon. The day ran bright and uncomplicated\u2014sunny at midday with a lively, high UV bite\u2014before easing into a gentler light, and now the UV is negligible and the air feels open and clean. Visibility is crisp, the kind that makes silhouettes of trees feel deliberate against the deepening blue, and the overall mood is quietly pleasant.\n\nIf you\u2019re heading out, think light layers: a soft sweater or light jacket over something breathable, comfortable shoes, and no real need for sun gear at this hour. It\u2019s a good night for a slow circuit around the paths, a short dog walk that lasts longer than planned, or a few minutes on a bench to let the day drain away. If you brought a notebook, jot a page; if you brought nothing, just listen to the park\u2019s low murmur and the city beyond it.",
