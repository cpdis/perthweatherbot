    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the rain falls softly, painting the streets with a sheen of reflection under the glow of city lights. Clouds blanket the sky, thick and unyielding, matching the gray mood that accompanies the heavy air. A brisk wind whispers through the hills, rustling leaves as gusts swell, and a damp chill creeps in, urging onlookers to seek the warmth of indoors. The marine layer drapes over the horizon, rendering the iconic Golden Gate Bridge a mere suggestion in the distance, cloaking it in an ethereal mist that hints at the strength of the approaching storm. \n\nTomorrow promises a continuation of this damp embrace, with rain expected to be heavier, further saturating the landscape. The gray remains constant, casting shadows on plans for the day. Attire advisable for the weather includes a sturdy umbrella and a warm, waterproof jacket to fend off the chill. For those seeking to navigate the wet streets, a leisurely visit to one of the city\u2019s cozy caf\u00e9s may be in order, allowing the soothing aroma of coffee to lift spirits while the world braves the storm just outside the window. Alternatively, visiting the local museums could provide a delightful escape where one can appreciate art and history away from the tumultuous elements.",
