    "weather_report": "In the measured hours of the young morning at Subiaco, there hangs a whisper of tranquillity carried in the cool air. Weather forecasts speak of delicate cloud formations that brush the sky with their tender fingertips: a liquid opal canopy painted with watercolour dreams of grey and white. While the sun yet slumbers below the horizon, it promises to return, the tender mother braced to cradle the world in its warming glow. Part the curtains, friends, and open the windows; let the soft hymns of this serene sky permeate into your rooms.\n\nYet, arm yourselves against the slight chill that might grace your skin by wearing perhaps a light sweater or bracing scarf. An ideal day for those who find solace in pleasant strolls around the city, the absence of the sun\u2019s intimidating burn acting as an invitation for those desiring to experience nature's subtler songs. What a day to revel in, for those who find joy in the embrace of an enchanting book under the comforting shade of a wise old tree, allowing the world around to subtly blend into the prose of distant tales.",
