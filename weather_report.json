    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a canvas transitioning from rain-soaked gray to fleeting patches of blue sky, beckoning with the promise of sunshine. The air is brisk, with the west wind whipping around at a comfortable pace, an invigorating embrace that hints at the cooling tide rushing in. While the forecast predicts a 90% chance of precipitation earlier in the day, indicating a steady drizzle preceding a clearing, there are moments when the sun timidly breaks through, casting playful shadows across the cityscape. \n\nA band of fog lingers near the horizon, hinting at the marine layer that often drapes this coastal haven, particularly around the Golden Gate Bridge. Even now, it gently softens the outlines of the city, evoking a serene, melancholic beauty amidst the bustling urban life. As the temperature nudges downwards, settling around the mid-50s, a light sweater or a cozy jacket would serve you well on a stroll through the neighborhoods or while sipping on a warm coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9. The charm of this weather encourages you to embrace a leisurely afternoon\u2014perhaps a visit to a local museum or a casual walk along the Embarcadero, where you can soak in the fresh air and the last embers of sun breaking through the clouds as day wanes into evening.",
