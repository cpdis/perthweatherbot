    "weather_report": "Tonight, as San Francisco drapes itself in a quilt of soft, mottled clouds, expect the thermometers to settle around a cool 45 degrees. The gentle night air carries a whisper of a north wind, rustling through the city\u2019s streets with a playful touch, while distant shadows of the Golden Gate Bridge loom like sentinels against the low glow of urban lights. For those moving about, a light jacket or sweater is a suitable layer, softening the crispness of the evening.\n\nTomorrow ushers in the possibility of a partly sunny day, with hints of warmth teasing the chill, peaking near 58 degrees and gently falling as the sun dances across the sky. The south-southeast breeze promises to keep the air feeling fresh, though the city may maintain a hint of its marine layer, particularly along the waterfront, where that enigmatic fog drapes over the bay. This weather invites pleasant pursuits\u2014perhaps a casual stroll along the Embarcadero, where the vibrating energy of the city mingles with the tranquil tides of the bay; or sipping a warm cup at a local caf\u00e9, watching the morning unfold as the sun battles the lingering clouds. Each moment brings a unique charm to the graceful rhythm of the city.",
