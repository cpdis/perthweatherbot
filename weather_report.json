    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, inky sky, the streets hushed and cool, the kind of predawn that sharpens the senses and makes the first kettle hiss sound luxurious. As the sun climbs, the sky stays clean and blue; expect a bright, untroubled morning with crisp air that softens in the light. Sunshine will be plentiful, the UV index quick to rise after sunrise and likely in the moderate-to-high range by late morning, so a hat, sunglasses, and a brush of sunscreen will be your quiet allies. It looks like a pleasant day in that understated Perth way: lucid, calm, and welcoming.\n\nDress in light layers for the early chill\u2014a soft sweater or jacket over something you won\u2019t mind rolling up once the sun gets to work. This is a morning for simple rituals: a slow walk to the bakery, opening the blinds wide, watering the herbs, hanging a load of washing that will dry nicely in the clear air, or cycling a few errands while the streets are still unhurried. Later, claim a sunny corner for reading, or linger over coffee outdoors where the light feels generous but not harsh.",
