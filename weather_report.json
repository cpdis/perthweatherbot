    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into night under a pewter sky, the air smelling of wet stone and jacaranda, with light rain expected to arrive toward late evening and linger into the small hours. Sunshine has packed up for the day and the UV is essentially nil; the world will look a touch blurred under streetlights, roads slick and reflective, the rain more whisper than drumbeat. It\u2019s a quietly pleasant sort of damp: dress in a light waterproof with a hood or compact umbrella, and shoes that won\u2019t sulk at puddles. Tonight suits small comforts and unhurried errands\u2014a short hooded walk to hear the leaves hiss, a simple supper nearby, or a book by an open window while the patter keeps time; if you\u2019re heading out late, allow an extra moment for glistening pavements and the soft distraction of rain.",
