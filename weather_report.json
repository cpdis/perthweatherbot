    "weather_report": "Past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is untroubled and glass-clear, stars pinned in place and the air a little cool on the cheeks. It\u2019s the kind of still, lucid night where sounds travel and the streets feel kindly lit, with no haze to soften the edges.\n\nToward dawn, these clean skies look set to linger, promising a bright, straightforward morning. UV is essentially asleep now, but once the sun lifts it will wake fast in spring; plan shade, sunscreen, and sunglasses by late morning if you\u2019ll be out. Expect a crisp, gentle start easing to comfortable warmth, the sort of day that casts sharp shadows and makes colours ring true. Dress in light layers: a soft jumper or light jacket before sunrise, then a breathable shirt, hat, and easy shoes once the light comes on strong. Good hours ahead for a quiet loop on foot or bike before breakfast, a bakery run, putting a wash on the line, or tending a few pots while the day opens without fuss.",
