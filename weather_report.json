    "weather_report": "Perth slips into late afternoon under a pale, well-behaved sky, the sun softened by just a few idle clouds. Expect the rest of the day to stay mostly sunny and clean-lined, with the light turning golden toward five and easing into a clear, gentle evening. The UV bite is fading now; it was strong earlier, but at this hour it is sliding toward forgiving, though a little sun sense is still wise if you linger outdoors before dusk. The air feels uncomplicated and dry, the horizon sharp, the sort of clarity that makes small details pop\u2014gum leaves, verandas, the river\u2019s quiet steel-blue surface.\n\nDress in light, breathable layers; sunglasses for the next hour, then a cardigan or light sweater as the warmth drains away. It\u2019s a good time for ordinary pleasures: a short walk to the corner shop, clipping a few herbs for dinner, a lap around the block with the dog, or finishing that half-read book on the back step while the day quietly folds itself up. If you\u2019ve washing to do, the last of the sun will still help; if you\u2019ve been indoors, step out and let the calm light rinse your eyes before evening settles.",
