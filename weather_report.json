    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear pre-dawn sky, the air cool, the streets hushed, and a faint pale seam of light gathering in the east. Forecasts hint at a lucid day ahead: a bright, unclouded morning that sharpens into clean, generous sunshine. Expect the UV to climb quickly through late morning\u2014spring light here has a keen edge\u2014so it will feel brilliantly clear and pleasantly warm by mid to late morning, with crisp visibility and sharp shadows.\n\nBegin with light layers: a soft jumper or long sleeves for the early chill, easy to shed to a tee by mid-morning. Add sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and sunscreen if you\u2019re out for long. It\u2019s a good morning for small, ordinary pleasures\u2014pick up bread and a coffee as the shops stir, hang a load of washing to drink in the sun, cycle the short commute, or tend the balcony pots. Around lunchtime, find patches of shade for lingering; later, when the light mellows, a quiet walk through the park or a chapter on the veranda will suit the mood of the day.",
