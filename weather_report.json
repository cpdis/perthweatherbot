With temperatures dipping to a cool 49 degrees, it\u2019s advisable to don a light jacket, perhaps layered over a warm sweater to embrace the chill. The gentle south wind whispers through the city, offering a refreshing touch without being intrusive.\n\nTomorrow holds promise with sunny skies gracing the horizon, beckoning locals and visitors alike to venture outdoors. A high near 62 will lend itself well to afternoon activities, though it is likely to feel a bit cooler later in the day. The marine layer appears to be absent this night, allowing for a clear view of the stars, while the celebrated landmarks remain illuminated against the night sky. \n\nThe serene conditions invite a myriad of simple pleasures\u2014perhaps an evening walk along the Embarcadero or a leisurely dinner at a local caf\u00e9, relishing the beautifully crisp atmosphere. One might consider wrapping up the night with a warm drink, enjoying the calm anticipation of a golden day ahead.",
