    "weather_report": "Late afternoon drifts in under a soft grey lid, the sun mostly veiled and the light turned to pewter. Showers are sliding through as light, passing rain, leaving the streets a shade darker and the air a touch sweeter. Expect more of these modest interruptions toward evening rather than a deluge; the day stays muted, with visibility softened at the edges and the UV now subdued. It\u2019s a gentle, slightly damp sort of weather\u2014pleasant if you lean into it.\n\nA light rain jacket and comfortable, closed shoes will serve you well; a small umbrella earns its keep. This is a good hour for unhurried errands beneath awnings, a browse through a bookshop, or a quiet caf\u00e9 corner where coat sleeves steam as you settle in. If you\u2019d rather move, a calm gym session or a short tram ride and a walk between showers suits the mood. Let the day taper with something simple on the stove and the window cracked to hear the rain\u2019s small percussion.",
