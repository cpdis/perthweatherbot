    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night has settled in with a gentle embrace of partly cloudy skies, a fine and tranquil presence hanging over the city. The current temperature drifts around the low fifties, barely nudged by a soft southwest breeze that whispers through the streets. Tomorrow promises a shift towards a brighter panorama, with mostly sunny conditions expected. The high will tease 63, only to slip into the coolness of the afternoon, hovering around 59. This subtle descent in warmth, coupled with a calm west wind, heralds a day perfect for leisurely pursuits.\n\nAs the sun rises, one might gaze toward the horizon, where the marine layer dances lightly, hinting at a coastal charm that often cloaks the city. The clarity of the morning is inviting, beckoning those with a taste for gentle adventure. A light jacket would be wise, arming against the coolness as the day unwinds. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero would beckon, where the bay breezes offer a refreshing backdrop, or visiting one of the many cozy cafes, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the crisp air. Whatever the choice, the day unfurls as a canvas of possibility gently rolled out beneath a serene San Francisco sky.",
