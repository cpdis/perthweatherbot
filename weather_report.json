    "weather_report": "Perth wakes under a quilt of cloud, the light already softened as the morning leans toward lunch. Showers look set to drift through late morning and again in the early afternoon, the sun mostly a pale coin behind gauze. Expect only brief, filtered brightness; UV will be muted under the thicker cover but can nip when the cloud thins, so a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray. The rain should rinse the air clean, leaving edges of the city softened and the day quiet, the kind that hushes traffic and sharpens the scent of the earth.\n\nDress for changeability: a light waterproof over easy layers, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and a small umbrella for company. It\u2019s a good day for a tidy loop to the caf\u00e9 between showers, a slow browse at the library, or knocking off a few domestic errands with a pocket of music in your ears. If the sky opens briefly, take a short walk and let the cool, rinsed air do its steadying work.",
