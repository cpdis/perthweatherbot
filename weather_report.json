    "weather_report": "As twilight enfolds Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds lingers overhead, promising a serene if somewhat muted evening. The air cools gradually, settling around the low forties, a prelude to the night that draws near. The familiar whisper of the north-northeast wind brushes against the skyline, carrying hints of the ocean. While the current scene feels slightly hazy, the promise of a clearer expanse hangs in the balance as the night deepens\u2014a typical San Francisco transformation where the city's lights twinkle like scattered jewels against the night, providing a soft contrast to the overcast sky.\n\nWith a bright and sunny Sunday on the horizon, residents can look forward to the warming embrace of the sun, which will eventually chase away the chill. Tomorrow's high, a modest yet pleasant sixty-two degrees, invites casual day-to-day activities: a stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps, discovering local fare, or a leisurely afternoon at one of the city\u2019s innumerable coffee shops, basking in the gentle warmth as the temperatures cool again in the late afternoon. For tonight, dressing in layers would be wise\u2014a light jacket or sweater will suffice to stave off the evening chill, setting the stage for quiet conversations punctuated by the soft sounds of the city at rest.",
