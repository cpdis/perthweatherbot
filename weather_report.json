    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the city greets you with a distinctive blend of mist and sun. This morning has ushered in a veil of patchy fog that lingers gently before noon, evoking an almost ethereal quality as the sun begins its ascent. Although the temperature remains cool, nearing the mid-fifties, the competition between the sun's warmth and the lingering chill makes stepping out a contemplative affair. The north wind whispers softly at around eight miles per hour, drawing the courage of the sun against the shy embrace of the marine layer.\n\nAs the afternoon nears, expect the fog to retreat, giving way to clearer skies that dance with sunlight, though the ever-present coolness will beckon you to dress in layers. A light jacket paired with a cozy sweater will serve you well, ideal for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely exploration of the city\u2019s boutiques, perhaps finding shelter in a caf\u00e9 where the warmth complements the aromatic coffee. Tonight, the ambiance shifts to partly cloudiness, with temperatures dipping to around 48 degrees, encouraging you to continue the exploration or simply find comfort among friends in a warm setting as you gaze at the emerging stars, gently towering over the charming silhouette of the city.",
