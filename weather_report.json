    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft blend of partly cloudy skies ushers in the evening. A gentle west wind breathes through the air, escaping the chill that teases the temperature down to about 52 degrees. The city, draped in the quiet approach of night, wears a shroud of golden hues that slowly gives way to deeper blues, hinting at the promise of rain tomorrow. With visibility currently clear, the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge stands proud, framed against a canvas of clouds that herald the night's quiet embrace.\n\nLooking ahead, the warm halo of sunshine we have enjoyed for most of the day will fade, giving way to a forecast of likely rain by late afternoon tomorrow. The atmosphere, charged with a 70% chance of precipitation, suggests that those venturing outdoors might want to prepare for wet roads and a brisk breeze. For the present moment, light layers will suffice to stave off the evening coolness\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater and a lightweight jacket will be your best companions as you stroll through the tranquil streets, or sip a warm beverage in the charming cafes that dot the neighborhood. This evening, it may also inspire a quiet walk along the waterfront, where the rhythmic lap of waves against the shore curates an intimate soundtrack to the city's pulse, inviting you to savor the fleeting moments of a day that will soon yield to rain.",
