    "weather_report": "As the early hours of Sunday unfold, Downtown San Francisco finds itself under a cloak of humidity, with a whisper of drizzle still lingering in the air and shadows of moisture hovering lightly on the skyline. The clouds form a thick yet gentle blanket, suppressing the brilliance of dawn, while a mild breeze stirs through the streets, carrying the unmistakable scent of rain. The low temperature, resting comfortably around 54, gives way to a day that is expected to bring more than just the subtleties of drizzles; a curtain of rain showers will drop their quiet cadence before the afternoon light can properly fill the space.  \n\nAs the city awakens, a lingering marine layer rests over the Golden Gate, hinting at a day that may not fully reveal its splendor until later. The chance of precipitation looms large at 90%, painting the horizon with the promise of a few showers and possibly a damp afternoon, as temperatures hover at a comfortable 59 before dipping again. Those venturing outside would do well to don light layers, perhaps a waterproof jacket to combat the intermittent rain and a warm scarf to fend off the chill. Consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the blend of urban energy and the pulsing rhythm of the bay can be savored amidst the melange of falling droplets \u2014 the rain acting as a backdrop to the city\u2019s diverse character, inviting introspection and quiet exploration amidst the clouds.",
