The absence of fog presents a rare opportunity to enjoy the iconic skyline, perhaps taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or indulging in a cozy cafe tucked away in one of the city\u2019s charming streets. As the sun fades, the urban evening beckons for quiet reflection, enjoying the ambiance of the city slowly slipping into night.",
