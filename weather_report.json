    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco feels open and honest: a clear sky, sun slanting low, shadows lengthening along verandas and jacaranda trunks. It will stay mostly sunny through the next hour, the light softening to honey before a few gentle clouds slip in after dusk. The air is clean and visibility is sharp, a crisp clarity that flatters everything it touches. UV has lost its midday bite and is easing now, dropping to comfortable levels with the fading light, though sunglasses and a brim still make sense if you\u2019re out before sunset. It\u2019s the sort of pleasant, breathable spring afternoon for light layers\u2014linen or cotton now, a cardigan ready for the cooler turn after dark. Good weather for small, contented errands: a stroll to pick up bread, watering the pots, a spin on the bike to return a library book, or sitting by a window with the breeze and a late cup of tea as the sky mellows.",
