    "weather_report": "As the sun dips lower on the horizon in Subiaco, a gentle breeze whispers through the air, weaving through the scattered clouds from earlier and now brushing against the broken ones that have gathered. The sky, painted with soft hues as daylight fades, casts a dreamy pallor over the town, not too bright nor piercing, making for an evening that feels closer to a comforting embrace than anything else. With the waning sunlight, the UV index naturally retreats, removing any harshness and leaving behind an ambiance both gentle and forgiving. The day, though once lively and slightly unpredictable, is now settling into a rhythm that gently cocoons the world around it.\n\nDressing for this serene evening invites light layers; perhaps a comfortable sweater or a beloved jacket to guard against the cool that will inevitably deepen as the night unfolds. This is an evening for leisurely strolls through the streets as the city quiets, where one might lose themselves under the ever-changing sky. Or perhaps, it's best enjoyed from a patio or a cozy nook, with a warm cup in hand, basking in the tranquility as the remaining light slowly gives way to twilight. This isn't a moment designed for grandeur or spectacle, but rather for finding joy in the subtleties\u2014the rustle of leaves, the distant laughter echoing down the lanes, and the quiet promise of a new day lying just beyond the dusk.",
