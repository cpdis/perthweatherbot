    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Subiaco the air feels hushed and a little heavy, with cloud thickening ahead of light, passing showers due toward the small hours and around dawn. Expect a muted, silvery start to the day with wet pavements and a soft patter on awnings rather than a drenching. Sunshine will be scarce early, with only shy glimmers through gaps in the cloud; visibility otherwise good, the world a little blurred at the edges.\n\nAs morning stretches on, the sky should slowly brighten with occasional blue breaking through, and when the sun does appear it will have some bite despite the recent rain\u2014UV rises quickly here in early November, so keep sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen handy for late morning and afternoon, even if it stays partly cloudy. A light layer and a packable rain jacket suit the first hours; by midday, breathable clothes will be more comfortable as the day steadies into something mild and usable. It\u2019s a good day for ordinary pleasures: a quiet coffee while the showers pass, a trip to the bookshelves or the market, then a lazy wander along Rokeby Road once the streets have dried, the air smelling faintly of rain and eucalyptus.",
