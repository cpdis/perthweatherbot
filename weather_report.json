    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is heavy with clouds that promise a damp Friday ahead. A thick marine layer hugs the city, hinting at the impending rain, transforming the skyline into a muted canvas of gray hues. The cool air, around fifty-two degrees, carries with it the invigorating chill of the ocean, stirring a subtle anticipation for the day ahead. With temperatures expected to peak near sixty-two before gently slipping back into the early evening, the weather calls for layers today\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a light jacket, perfect for those moments when the wind picks up, whispering through the streets.\n\nDespite the forecast of rain later in the afternoon, there remains an intimate beauty in the city\u2019s quietude this early morning. An ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets, where the scent of damp earth mixes with the rich aroma of brewing coffee. Seek refuge in a local caf\u00e9 with a good book, or take a moment to appreciate the muted beauty of the fog rolling across the bay, veiling the Golden Gate Bridge in an elusive embrace. The day holds the promise of a cozy gathering as the clouds thicken, inviting conversation and warmth as the first drops of rain begin to fall. It's a reminder of San Francisco's ever-changing weather, requiring not just an umbrella but an open heart to the city\u2019s fleeting moments of tranquility.",
