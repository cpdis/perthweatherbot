    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crisp coolness, reminiscent of gentle whispers from the ocean. The sky, partly cloaked in softness, suggests a serene evening ahead with temperatures dropping to a refreshing low of around 42. The northwest wind, at a modest 7 mph, tickles the leaves and adds a gentle chill, a reminder that the city's charm comes with its own kind of briskness. \n\nLooking forward to tomorrow, one can sense a chance of rain after the cozy afternoon sun\u2014mostly sunny at first, before the clouds reclaim their dominance and introduce light showers by late afternoon. With high temperatures peaking near 54 and then gradually retreating to a cooler 51, a light jacket will be your most trusted companion as the day transitions. A morning stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee at a downtown caf\u00e9 would suit this manageable weather nicely; the fog, storied and fleeting, looks like it might edge in silently, but for now, the horizon remains clear enough to enjoy the sporadic warmth of the winter sun.",
