    "weather_report": "The curtains of night are readying to retreat in Subiaco, as a spectrum of sapphire not yet chased away by dawn paints the sky. Long, nocturnal shadows are still creeping through the streets, silhouetted by the soft glow of clear skies. The midnight blue steadily melting into cobalt, foretelling a spectacular day wherein the sun will take center stage unopposed, promising an unhindered dance of light playing upon the city's mosaic.\n\nThe forecast couldn't picture a more delightful day. All signs point to a waltz of sunshine, unobstructed, making her grand entrance on the celestial stage. Clear and bright from the moment the rooster cries, the day unfurls with not a wisp of cloud to obstruct the radiating light. Dress lightly and comfortably, as the day will be an ode to delightful weather that begs to be enjoyed. The simplicity of our daily tasks ought to become a procession of quiet joys in this serene weather. Perhaps an unhurried walk to the market, basking in gentle sunbeams, or a leisurely afternoon in a well-shaded park, the day's clarity reflected in glistening leaves.",
