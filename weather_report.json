    "weather_report": "Perth wears a bright but thinning noon light, the sun softened behind a gauzy veil of cloud. It doesn\u2019t feel crisp; edges are a little muted, the horizon slightly washed as if someone turned the contrast down. Sunshine will be fleeting rather than generous, yet the UV can still nip at exposed skin when the cloud thins, typical of this time of year. Expect a gentle, silvery glow more than a blaze.\n\nBy mid to late afternoon, light rain looks likely to drift across the city, a polite shower rather than a theatrical downpour. It reads as a mild, somewhat humid day that invites light layers\u2014breathable shirt, easy trousers\u2014and a compact umbrella or thin rain jacket in your bag, just in case. Good weather for ordinary comforts: finish errands before the showers, linger over a book at a quiet caf\u00e9, sort a cupboard, or take a short stroll under leafy streets and awnings, savoring the cool of the passing sprinkle. If you\u2019re outdoors, a hat and a touch of sunscreen are still worth the fuss, even under a softened sky.",
