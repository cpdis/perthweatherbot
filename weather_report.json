    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the sun illuminates the city under a wide, bright sky, casting gentle warmth with temperatures just reaching the low sixties. The air is crisp yet welcoming, accompanied by a mild west-southwest breeze that rustles the leaves and invites you to linger outside. However, beyond this sunshine, a hint of the impending evening lingers in the distance\u2014clouds are slowly beginning to gather, a precursor to the possibility of drizzle later tonight. If you gaze towards the horizon, the marine layer may be subtly creeping in, casting a gauzy veil over the Golden Gate, suggesting that soon enough, mist might embrace the area.\n\nWith the evening's drizzling rain forecast to start between 10 PM and 4 AM, it's wise to dress comfortably for this transition. A light jacket will suffice, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater\u2014providing just enough warmth against the chill while remaining versatile for the sun's lingering presence. As you navigate your day, consider enjoying a stroll along the Embarcadero, enjoying the urban tapestry of the city. Post-dinner, stop by a cozy caf\u00e9\u2014perhaps one with outdoor seating\u2014where you can people-watch as the atmosphere shifts towards the evening. Today captures that beautiful interplay of San Francisco's unique weather: sunlit cheer amidst a backdrop of looming clouds, evoking both the familiar comforts of home and the enigmatic thrill of what the night may bring.",
