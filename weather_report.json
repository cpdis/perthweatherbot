    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and pleasantly cool, perfectly encapsulating that serene late afternoon charm. The sun has begun its gentle descent, wrapping the city in a soft palette of golden hues as temperatures hover around 58 degrees. A light breeze whispers through the streets, suggesting a warm yet manageable evening ahead. Tonight, expect the skies to remain mostly clear, inviting stargazers and those seeking a peaceful moment outside to enjoy the tranquility at a comfortable low of around 49 degrees.\n\nThose venturing out might consider a light sweater or jacket, embracing the soothing embrace of early winter. It\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or through one of the many parks, where the last traces of sunlight give way to the shimmering glow of the city lights. Alternatively, gather friends for a quiet evening at a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth of conversation can compete with the cool breeze outside. The conditions are ripe for enjoying the simple pleasures of life, as the haze of fog usually characteristic of this time of year holds off for now, allowing the city's majestic skyline to stand proudly against the night sky.",
