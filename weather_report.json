    "weather_report": "Morning in Richmond arrives washed in pale winter light. Overnight was clear and toward dawn a few clouds wandered in; now the sky leans mostly sunny with occasional tufts sliding by, the air clean and crisp and the horizon well-defined. The sun feels kind but not fierce, with a winter-soft UV that will nudge up around midday yet remain on the low side. It looks like a pleasant, quietly bright day rather than a glaring one.\n\nDress in easy layers: a sweater under a light coat, perhaps a scarf if a breeze sneaks around corners, and sunglasses for the gentle glare off windshields and water. It\u2019s a fine day for modest plans\u2014an unhurried coffee walk, a loop through the neighborhood to mail a card, tending a few chores by a sunny window, or a calm spin to the market. If you\u2019re outdoors, take your time and let the clear edges of the day set the pace; if you\u2019re in, open the blinds and let the light do some of the work.",
