    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco wears a gentle sheen: patches of blue sifted by scattered cloud, the light lively but softening at the edges. Through early afternoon the sun will come and go, bright intervals giving way to thicker, broken cloud toward late day, trading sparkle for a calmer, pewter tint. UV will still bite a little around the early afternoon peak despite the cloud breaks, then ease as the sun lowers and the cover gathers. The air feels clean and readable for now, with outlines crisp; by evening the growing cloud will soften the view and quiet the colors.\n\nDress in easy layers\u2014a light shirt with something you can shrug on if a breeze stirs\u2014and keep sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen handy. It\u2019s a day for small pleasures: a meander to the greengrocer, a coffee taken outdoors when the sun finds you, a browse through the bookshop, or a short detour through a leafy street before the sky turns grayer. At home, crack a window for a soft draft, water the basil, and let the afternoon amble along without hurry.",
