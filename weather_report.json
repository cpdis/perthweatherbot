    "weather_report": "Perth slips toward evening under a lid of cloud, the light already thinning at half past four. The first proper band of rain is poised to arrive around sundown and settle in for the evening, a steady, moderate patter that turns pavements glossy and softens the edges of the skyline. Sunshine will be scarce to none, and the UV is effectively a non-issue now; the day feels muted, with clarity dimmed to a comfortable hush rather than a murk.\n\nDress for damp: a light waterproof with a hood or a no-nonsense umbrella, shoes that won\u2019t skate on wet tile, and a dry layer to pull on later. If you\u2019ve errands, take care of the quick ones before the heaviest showers set in; after that, lean into indoor comforts\u2014a quiet window seat at a neighborhood cafe, a simple grocery run for something to simmer, or the unglamorous pleasure of sorting a drawer while the rain taps time on the roof. Travel unhurried; the roads will ask for patience.",
