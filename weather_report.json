    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco awakens from its slumber, the early hours present a crisp, clear canvas, unmarred by the fog that often drapes the coast. The sky stretches above like a yawning expanse of blue, while the gentle breath of wind whispers along the streets, carrying with it the coolness of the night. Daybreak teases the horizon, hinting at a sun-drenched day yet to unfold. With temperatures resting near 47 degrees, a light jacket or sweater may provide just enough warmth for those venturing out into the fresh morning air.\n\nAs the day progresses, the sun will rise high, casting golden rays upon the city's iconic skyline. Alongside temperatures that will flirt with the low sixties, expect a drop in afternoon warmth, nudging down towards 58. The afternoon promises clarity, inviting residents to explore the city's hidden alcoves or enjoy a quiet moment in the park, perhaps savoring a cup of artisanal coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy that characterizes each San Francisco day. With the north wind gently guiding the way, it\u2019s an opportune moment for a brisk walk along the Embarcadero or a leisurely stroll through the Mission District, where the warmth of community mingles seamlessly with the coolness of the air.",
