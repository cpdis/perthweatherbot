    "weather_report": "Midnight finds Albany damp and muted, the day having slipped from a solid ceiling of cloud into a light, steady rain at dusk. The night feels soft around the edges, with low clouds smudging the skyline and pavement catching streetlamp glints. Sun will be mostly hidden for a while; the UV index is negligible now and likely to stay on the low side at first light unless the deck breaks. Expect a gray-leaning morning with decent but hazy clarity, the air cool and a touch metallic.\n\nDress for the hush: a light waterproof layer, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and an umbrella in your bag just in case. At this hour, lean into modest comforts\u2014brew something warm, tidy a corner, sketch the day\u2019s errands. If you must head out early, a brisk walk under the low ceiling can clear the head, and drivers should take the damp streets a bit gently until the world wakes and dries.",
