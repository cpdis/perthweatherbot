    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself wrapped in the embrace of an early morning rain, its streets glistening in the muted light. The atmosphere, a gentle mix of moisture and wind, carries the promise of change; low clouds hang over the horizon, casting a soft, grey hue across the skyline, particularly around the iconic Golden Gate. With wind gusts teasing at 29 mph, one can sense the vibrant energy of the city stirring awake, though it remains shrouded in a veiled mist that tempts the sun to break through.\n\nAs the day unfolds, a slight chance of lingering rain lingers until late morning before patches of blue may emerge, teasing out a mostly sunny afternoon. The air, cool and crisp with temperatures settling around 55 degrees, invites layered clothing; a light jacket or sweater paired with a scarf would be wise, offering a comfortable balance against the brisk breeze. The sights and sounds outside beckon you to explore close by \u2013 perhaps to take a leisurely stroll through one of the city's charming parks, savor a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, or simply observe the cities life ebbing and flowing around you. One wouldn\u2019t need to rush, for today is an invitation to enjoy the subtle beauty hidden in the moment.",
