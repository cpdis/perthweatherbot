    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a gentle, generous light: a blue sky washed with a few feathery clouds and good, honest clarity. Through late morning and into the early afternoon those fair-weather puffs should linger but keep mostly out of the way, leaving a day that feels open and dry, more sun than shade. UV will climb quickly by late morning as spring flexes, so a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen are wise; dress in light layers you can peel back as the day warms, with breathable fabrics for an easy stride. It\u2019s a pleasant day to walk to your errands, linger over a coffee outside, or take a quiet lap through the park paths and sit a spell in dappled shade. Windows can be opened, laundry will dry without fuss, and a midday pause under an awning will make the afternoon feel just right.",
