    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of clouds drifts lazily across the sky, hinting at the night's rain showers that could come before dawn. The air cools, with a tender chill wrapping around the city, a gentle reminder of the winter season. At this hour, with temperatures dipping to around 49 degrees, the elements conspire to encourage a thoughtful layering\u2014think of slipping into a cozy sweater beneath a light jacket, perhaps accompanied by a scarf to fend off the brisk south breeze that brushes through the streets.\n\nFor those planning their Tuesday, the promise of mostly sunny skies brings a welcome optimism after the dampness of night. Highs near 58 will accompany the day, with a slight descent by afternoon, providing an inviting opportunity for comfortable walks around the neighborhood. The air ought to clear, perhaps revealing hints of the scenic vistas that San Francisco is renowned for. Ideal engagements include a leisurely stroll along the waterfront to revel in the crisp air, or perhaps a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9, where one might enjoy a warm drink while basking in the city\u2019s unfolding beauty. \n\nWith the possibility of morning fog still lingering over the bay, keep an eye out for spots where the marine layer clings, creating ephemeral landscapes that shift with the sun's playful rays. Dress wisely, embrace the layers, and venture forth, as another day of San Francisco's character unfolds with quiet charm.",
