    "weather_report": "Morning in Katy arrives soft and unhurried, the sky mottled with scattered clouds that let through tempered light. The overnight forecast showed those same broken patches lingering into the early hours, so expect a mix today: intervals of sun, then a gauzy veil, then sun again. Clarity should be decent, the horizon clean rather than hazy, with brightness that feels kind to the eyes. This time of year keeps the UV index on the low side, nudging up a bit around midday if the cloud deck shreds, so sunglasses help but aren\u2019t mandatory.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant, low-drama day\u2014more companionable than dazzling. Dress in easy layers: a breathable shirt with a light sweater or jacket you can shed if the sun leans your way. Think comfortable shoes for a midmorning loop around the block, a leisurely grocery run, or a quiet hour on the patio with a notebook. If you\u2019ve chores waiting\u2014car wash, plant watering, a tidy-up in the garage\u2014this weather plays along without pressing you. No strong hints of rain in the early outlook; just a gentle breeze and a sky content to change its mind now and then.",
