    "weather_report": "As the night yields to the early hours in Woodlands, a gentle, almost rhythmic patter of light rain quietly embraces the landscape, painting it with a tempered serenity. With the clock casting its spell at past two in the morning, the world is shrouded in the lingering cool of raindrops, whispering promises of a subdued morning ahead. Though the forecast speaks only of the lingering light rain that started earlier, the sun seems shy today, hiding behind a sky etched with clouds that whisper tales of muted grays. The air around feels fresh and the light drizzle weaves a soothing cocoon, suggesting a day too timid for the sun's bold, golden strokes. \n\nFor those venturing out, dressing should lean towards layers that can dance between warmth and the fluttering caress of rain \u2014 perhaps a beloved sweater paired with a reliable waterproof jacket, where comfort finds its stride. It\u2019s a day unrushed, where one might find joy in the subtle pleasures: a quiet morning spent inside cradling a steamy cup of something to kindle the spirit, perhaps curled up with a book that enchants as much as the soft rain serenading the window. Or, perhaps, an amble through a nearby park with the resolute hum of the sky-laden grey as your companion, where every raindrop\u2019s descent births a momentary kingdom of blissful solitude.",
