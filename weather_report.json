    "weather_report": "Albany wakes before dawn under a quilt of scattered clouds, the sky mottled and dimly luminous as the city yawns itself into Sunday. The air feels calm and open, the kind that carries sound a little farther down quiet streets. With breaks in the cloud deck, the morning looks clear enough, a soft, blue-gray light promising a gentle start rather than a dramatic one.\n\nThrough the day, expect intervals of sunshine filtering between passing clouds. Bright moments should arrive in comfortable bursts rather than a fierce blaze, with the UV index near nil now and likely modest around midday if the gaps widen. Visibility looks good and the day\u2019s character leans agreeable, not dazzling. Dress in light layers: a sweater or light jacket at first light, easily shed to a shirt by late morning, and sunglasses for those brighter windows. It\u2019s a day for unhurried errands, a quiet walk to the bakery, tidying a corner of the house with the window cracked open, or a leisurely ride to the library. If you step out early, let the hush work on you; later, take the patchwork sun as permission to keep the pace humane.",
