    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with a polished clarity, the sky clean and open, stars like pins in dark velvet. The air feels gentle and unhurried; UV is essentially asleep now, and the streets take on that quiet, reflective mood that makes footsteps sound a touch more deliberate. It\u2019s pleasant in a simple, honest way, the kind of evening where you notice the scent of warm pavement finally letting go of the day.\n\nThe forecast holds steady and uncomplicated through late evening and after midnight: clear, dry, and calm. Expect dawn to break bright; once the sun is up the UV will build quickly in this late-spring stretch, so plan shade and sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out after breakfast. For now, light layers will do\u2014something you can shrug on for a short walk or to sit outside without a shiver. Good night for modest rituals: a slow lap around the block, watering the herbs, airing the house, or finishing a chapter on the balcony. If you\u2019re an early riser, pencil in a first-light stroll or hang a small wash to catch the early sun.",
