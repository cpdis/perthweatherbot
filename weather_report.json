    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a gentle embrace of sunlight, marked by a clarity that invites exploration. The temperature hovers comfortably around 63 degrees, gradually easing into a cooler embrace as the afternoon deepens. A light west-northwest breeze dances lightly, offering a refreshing companion to the warmth. The skies are mostly clear, the air crisp, with no hint of the fog that so often sweeps in from the ocean, leaving just a few wisps of cloud punctuating the azure above. \n\nAs evening approaches, a soft twilight will settle over the city, drawing the temperature down to a cool 49 degrees. A wise choice for attire would be layers, perhaps a light jacket or sweater for the later hours, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or an outdoor caf\u00e9, where the golden rays of the sun are still lingering in the sky. The day\u2019s clear visibility makes it ideal for a leisurely walk, perhaps along the Marina or through one of the city's vibrant neighborhoods, where the charm of San Francisco unfolds with every step. Tonight promises a tranquil beauty, with the stars glimmering in the clear night sky, perfect for quiet contemplation or a casual gathering with friends.",
