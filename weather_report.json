    "weather_report": "The evening draws in thick with whispers of rain, a muted curtain settling over the heart of Downtown San Francisco. As the hours tick toward dawn, expect a relentless downpour, with dark clouds enveloping the skyline and swirling in from the south, as if the city itself is wrapped in a damp embrace. The wind, strong and blustery, sends a chill deep into your bones, nudging you to tighten your coat and scurry along the streets, where puddles gather like little lakes, ready to reflect the muted glow of streetlights.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, the rain persists, shifting into sporadic showers and even the occasional rumble of thunder, providing an atmospheric symphony to accompany your daily ventures. The temperatures, stubbornly low, will hover just above the fifty-degree mark, leaving one to wonder if a cozy caf\u00e9 might provide a perfect refuge amidst the elements. Dress warmly, donning layers and a water-resistant jacket to fend off the moisture that promises to linger throughout the day. The marine layer may obscure the spectacular views, veiling the iconic Golden Gate in a shroud of mystery, yet this can serve as an invitation to explore the spirited charm of the city from within, perhaps indulging in a leisurely stroll through galleries or a quiet moment with a book in a local nook, while the world outside glistens in its wet attire.",
