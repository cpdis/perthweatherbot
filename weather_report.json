    "weather_report": "As the night unfurls in Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds shrouds the city, lending it an air of quiet anticipation. Occasional raindrops begin to tap lightly against windows, hinting at the heavier downpour expected as the clock strikes ten. The temperature hovers in the low fiftys, with a gentle breeze from the southeast that carries the scent of the profound, damp earth intermingled with the urban pulse. The certainty of rain holds a 100% chance tonight, with a promise of new rainfall that could gather between a tenth to a quarter of an inch, transforming the familiar streets with a shiny veneer that invites reflections.\n\nThroughout Saturday, the rain persists, draping the city in a constant embrace that feels both cozy and melancholic. Highs will linger near sixty, gradually giving way to a chill as the day progresses. The wind will accentuate the chill, gusting up to twenty-five miles per hour, making layers essential for comfort. A light waterproof jacket, a scarf, and sturdy footwear will ensure a pleasant venture, whether it's a stroll through a quiet neighborhood or a morning spent at a caf\u00e9, observing the rain paint the world anew. In this atmosphere, finding solace in a favorite book or inviting friends for a cozy gathering would be the perfect antidote to the gloomy weather, turning the day into one of warmth and connection.",
