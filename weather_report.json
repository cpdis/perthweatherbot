    "weather_report": "The night hangs over Downtown San Francisco with a gentle chill, the kind that reminds one of whispered secrets and the sound of distant waves. The air is clear, with the constellation of city lights sparking like stars caught between the horizon and the concrete. As the dawn approaches, the temperature lingers around a crisp 42 degrees, inviting a layer of warmth for those ready to embrace the day ahead.\n\nLooking into Tuesday, the sun will peek out, bringing with it a playful contrast of clouds that seem to dance on the edge of the skyline. By afternoon, the temperature will flirt with 53, tapering down slightly as the day progresses. A hint of rain might whisper after 4 PM, accompanied by a soft breeze from the northwest, suggesting a narrative of change. The moisture could introduce a brief curtain of fog over the Golden Gate, a reminder of nature\u2019s caprice. Whether you're sipping a warm beverage or tying your laces for a stroll, consider a light jacket or a snug scarf to ward off the coolness that could sneak in as the sun makes its retreat. Perhaps today is best suited for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a cozy afternoon in one of the local caf\u00e9s, savoring the evolving scenery of our beloved city where every corner presents a tale waiting to unfold.",
