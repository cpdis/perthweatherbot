    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the streets feel hushed and companionable, the sky mostly clear and star-pricked. The air has that clean, uncomplicated quality that makes everything sound closer. UV is negligible at this hour, and the night\u2019s clarity lends an easy, unhurried mood.\n\nToward dawn, some broken cloud is expected to drift in, likely softening the sunrise with a gauzy lid rather than snuffing it out. Once the sun lifts, brightness should build and the UV will climb quickly after breakfast, as it so often does here in spring, even with patches of cloud. It looks like a pleasant start overall. Light layers will serve you well: a tee under a long-sleeve or a cardigan now, and later, a hat and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019re out through the morning. It\u2019s a good time for a quiet pre-dawn wander to fetch bread, a slow coffee by the window while the light gathers, or a bit of backyard puttering before the day decides what it wants to be.",
