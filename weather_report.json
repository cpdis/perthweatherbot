    "weather_report": "As the morning light filters through a shroud of fog, Downtown San Francisco awakens to a day marked by the whispers of the Pacific. The atmosphere feels soft, cloaked in a blanket of mist that lingers just above the rooftops and flirts with familiar landmarks. The forecast hints at a mere 20% chance of drizzle, and yet, the early fog dances with a slight promise of moisture. By now, the temperature hovers gently around 58 degrees, almost as though the city is savoring the lingering chill before slipping comfortably into the afternoon's mild embrace.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the sun to peek through, casting a twinkling brilliance across the bay and perhaps nudging the fog to retreat. By evening, temperatures will cool, settling around 46 degrees, ushering in a quiet night with the gentle caress of a north wind that hints at the encroaching winter. For those venturing out today, layering is key. A light sweater paired with a comfortable jacket will keep you cozy as you stroll through neighborhoods, sip a warming cup of coffee, or visit the local bookstore. This is a day for enjoying the simple pleasures: perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the mist mingles with the salty air, or exploring the hidden charms of a cafe. Embrace the quiet beauty of the city as its fog creates an enchanting backdrop.",
