    "weather_report": "Mascot sinks into a damp, wind-brushed evening, the streets glossed with earlier showers and the sky a soft slate. Sunshine is absent now and the UV burden is near nil; the night feels mild rather than cold, with cloud keeping the air close and the horizon smudged. Forecasts point to light rain returning toward the small hours and lingering into early morning, so dawn is likely to arrive muted, with a pewter light rather than a blaze.\n\nIt\u2019s a night for easy clothes: a light layer, a packable umbrella, shoes that won\u2019t mind a puddle. If you venture out, it\u2019s a quick walk to the corner shop, a tram ride with a podcast, or a quiet drink under an awning listening to the soft hiss of rain. Indoors suits the mood too: a tidy-up, a slow pot on the stove, a chapter or two before bed. UV remains negligible until after sunrise; if clouds thin later in this midsummer stretch, be ready for a faster climb in glare, but early hours look subdued and gentle.",
