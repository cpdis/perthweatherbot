    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a heavy, gray blanket, punctuated by the relentless rhythm of returning rain. The air hangs thick with moisture, mirroring the forecast\u2019s promises of showers and thunderstorms. With gusty winds swirling around corners and whipping through alleys, a brisk south-southwest breeze carries both the scent of wet asphalt and the anticipation of more rain. As the day wanes, the temperature is settling into the cool comfort of the low fifties, a fitting prelude to a night cloaked in clouds, where nighttime showers will linger into tomorrow.\n\nGiven the heavy conditions, it would be wise to opt for a sturdy waterproof jacket and a pair of comfortable shoes\u2014practicality should reign over fashion today. A stroll through the Pruneyard might not be on the agenda, but the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9, with the soothing sounds of raindrops against the window, beckons. There, one might indulge in a steaming cup of coffee or perhaps a comforting bowl of soup. The charm of a rainy day, with its muted hues and softened outlines, invites introspection, making it a perfect time to lose oneself among the pages of a good book, allowing the world outside to fade into a gentle rhythm of rain.",
