    "weather_report": "Late morning in City Beach arrives under a perfectly rinsed sky, the light already bright and unwavering, shadows trimmed sharp along sand and pavement. The forecast keeps the canvas clear through midday and into early afternoon, so expect abundant sunshine and a UV index that grows assertive as the sun climbs. The day looks wonderfully crisp and transparent, the kind that makes colors pop and horizons seem nearer, pleasant in the shade but fierce in direct light.\n\nDress for sparkle and glare: airy fabrics, a brimmed hat, good sunglasses, and generous sunscreen, with a bottle of water tucked under the arm. It\u2019s a fine time for a gentle walk before lunch, a coffee lingered over in a cool, shaded corner, or a quick loop to the shops on foot while the world feels bright and orderly. Hang a load of laundry, give the houseplants a drink, or read a few quiet pages by an open window. If you do slip down to the shore, keep it brief and seek shade between spells; the sun will be beautiful but insistent.",
