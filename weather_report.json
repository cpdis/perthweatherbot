    "weather_report": "The morning air in Downtown San Francisco carries the weight of a soft fog, lingering gracefully over the skyline, but with the promise of a partly sunny day ahead. This gentle veil, dissipating as the sun rises, may embrace the Golden Gate Bridge for a little while longer, creating an enchanting sight for early risers. By mid-afternoon, expect a hint of brightness as temperatures will mellow to a cool 56 degrees, inviting a lightness to one\u2019s attire. A north wind whispers quietly through the streets, weaving through the bustling activities of the morning, perfect for casual strolls through one of the city\u2019s scenic blocks or enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9.\n\nAs night approaches, anticipation builds for a different mood altogether. Rain is set to sweep in later this evening, marking a transition to a more contemplative ambiance. The temperatures will hover around the low fifties, nudging residents to wrap themselves in warmer layers\u2014perhaps a soft scarf or a light jacket to shield against the encroaching wetness. As raindrops begin to kiss the pavement after ten, indoor pursuits will become more appealing. A visit to an art gallery or a meandering through local bookstores can be delightful distractions as the city softens under the rhythm of the rain. The chance is strong for a cozy evening spent under the glow of lights, whether sipping warm drinks at home or enjoying the vibrancy of local nightlife transformed by the rain\u2019s touch.",
