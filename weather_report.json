    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the night\u2019s stillness gradually gives way to a sky marked by hazy clouds, hinting at the day\u2019s charming potential. The current chill, with temperatures hovering around a brisk 46 degrees, offers a tender reminder to embrace warmth and comfort. The forecast promises a delightful transformation, with the morning evolving to mostly sunny conditions as the sun peaks, casting soft light on the city\u2019s iconic architecture. By afternoon, even as the high gently reaches near 56 degrees, the crisp air will retain a refreshing bite.\n\nExpect a delicate veil of fog hugging the shoreline, particularly near the Golden Gate, a signature feature of San Francisco\u2019s maritime embrace. While the marine layer might render the distant coastline slightly obscured, the heart of the city is likely to remain clear and inviting. For those venturing out this day, a cozy layer, perhaps a warm sweater beneath a light jacket, will harmonize perfectly with the cool breeze sweeping in from the northwest. This is a splendid day to roam its streets\u2014consider a quiet stroll through one of the spacious parks, perhaps visiting a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink while soaking in the ambiance, as the city keeps its rhythm in tune with the gentle winds.",
