    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a hush tonight, the streets dark and lightly spattered, the air smelling of wet pavement. Light rain is drifting in through the small hours, softening the edges of things and leaving a sheen under the lamps. There\u2019s no sun to speak of now and the UV rests near zero; come daybreak the sky may stay murky at first, with showers lingering toward dawn. If the cloud thins later, the light will turn sharp quickly, but for the morning expect a muted, pearly kind of day with softened horizons.\n\nDress for a damp start: a light waterproof layer, closed shoes you don\u2019t mind getting splashed, and a small umbrella. Keep sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen handy for any midday breaks in the cloud\u2014spring light here can be sneaky even after rain. At this hour, it\u2019s a night for quiet errands and gentle routines: set the kettle going, queue tomorrow\u2019s playlist, lay out that rain jacket for the commute. Early risers might enjoy a short, brisk walk beneath awnings before caf\u00e9s open, then let the day unfold indoors\u2014reading in a corner seat, a tidy-up, a museum hour\u2014until the weather decides how brave it wants to be.",
