    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a hint of chill, a gentle reminder of the approaching winter nights. The sky is draped in a quilt of cloud cover, with the mercury hovering around a brisk 49 degrees, giving way to a modest rise as the night progresses. A light breeze from the north-northeast stirs, whispering through the city streets, contributing to that crisp, invigorating feel that's both refreshing and somewhat invigorating\u2014perfect for a quiet stroll or a chance encounter at a local caf\u00e9.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the dawn promises a change; the clouds will part to reveal vibrant sunshine, warming the city to a comfortable 62 degrees before the afternoon brings a subtle drop. The marine layer, while present tonight, is expected to retreat, allowing the iconic views of the Golden Gate and the bay to emerge, gleaming in the daylight. For those venturing out, a light jacket in the early hours will suffice, transitioning gracefully to layers that breathe with the pleasant afternoon light. So whether it's a leisurely morning walk along the waterfront or a visit to a local bookstore, tomorrow opens up a canvas of serene possibilities against a backdrop of rich city life.",
