    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush before dawn, the air already smelling of rain. Light showers gather at the edges of morning and will spill through the early hours, keeping the sky dull and pewter, the sun reduced to a pale smear behind cloud. Expect a soft-focus daybreak with slick pavements and muted horizons; visibility will be fine, but everything will feel blurred at the edges. UV is very low at this hour and should stay modest if the cloud holds, rising only if there are breaks later on.\n\nIt looks like a gently damp, slightly melancholy morning rather than a bright one. A light waterproof or trench, breathable layers, and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles will suit the mood; tuck a compact umbrella in your bag. This is good weather for unhurried errands once the showers ease, answering yesterday\u2019s messages by a window, or a short walk beneath awnings to fetch bread and a newspaper. If gaps appear in the drizzle later, take a brief spin through a nearby park, then retreat to a caf\u00e9 stool and watch the street come back to life in the softened light.",
