    "weather_report": "Perth slides into late afternoon under a soft, mottled sky, the light already gentled and the air smelling faintly of rain. A brief spell of light showers is drifting in around the commute, trimming what little sunshine remains; UV has eased and will keep falling with the dusk. As evening settles, the clouds are expected to loosen into broken patches, offering a few pale openings and a clearer view to the west, but not much in the way of glare. The day feels mild and serviceable rather than sparkling; visibility is decent, just softened at the edges by moisture.\n\nA light waterproof or compact umbrella will be the best companion, with breathable layers for the cool-down after the shower passes. Pavements may be slick, so unhurried steps are the order of the hour. It\u2019s a good evening for everyday errands: pick up groceries, duck into a quiet caf\u00e9, or take a short stroll between drops and watch the streets regain their sheen as the clouds thin. If you\u2019ve a mind to be home, open a window after the rain and let that clean, rain-washed air wander through.",
