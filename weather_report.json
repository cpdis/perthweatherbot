    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits in a quiet midnight hush, the sky mostly clear for now, the kind of polished dark that makes the streetlights feel thoughtful. Forecast hints at change toward dawn: a brush of light rain softening the edges of morning, the clarity going from crystalline to watercolor. It won\u2019t be sunny yet, and the UV is negligible through the small hours; after sunrise, if the clouds thin, the November sun will gather strength quickly, the kind that nips at unguarded skin even through bright gaps.\n\nExpect a gentle, somewhat pleasant start, tempered by damp pavements and a passing shower. Dress in easy layers with a light shell or small umbrella at hand, and shoes ready for a wet footpath. If you\u2019re up early, take a short, unhurried walk between showers and let the air do its quiet work; otherwise, ease into the day with coffee by a window and a simple errand once the rain slackens. If the sun breaks through later, carry a hat and a dab of sunscreen, then get on with the ordinary rituals\u2014commute, market run, a tidy-up\u2014while the sky decides what it wants to be.",
