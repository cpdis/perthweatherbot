    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle haze drapes the city, the skies partly obscured by clouds that hint at a more tumultuous day to come. The air, fresh and cool, carries the whisper of impending rain, teasing the senses with a bouquet of earthy anticipation. With a low settling around 52 degrees, the evening calls for light layers; a sweater or jacket would serve well against the slight chill that dances on the breeze.\n\nTomorrow, the mellow light of day will give way to rain, likely beginning after five. A unique character emerges from the mix, promising a brief respite of sunshine before the clouds reclaim the sky. Daytime temperatures linger around a modest 62, dipping to a cooler 60 in the afternoon as the weather shifts. A gentle west-southwest wind, with moments of briskness, reminds one of autumn's playful temperament. Navigating the city in such weather, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping in a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink while the world outside becomes a watercolor of grays and greens\u2014a moment to reflect as the landscapes soften under a light drizzle. The marine layer will likely cloak the bridge, inviting tales of fog and history to surface in the collective memory of this iconic locale.",
