    "weather_report": "In the quiet heart of Subiaco, the day wears a gentle veil of light rain, an atmospheric ensemble that softly diffuses the sun's rays and leaves the city with a muted glow. As the rain drizzles down, creating a rhythm against leaves and cobblestones, the air carries a fresh, earthy scent that whispers of life renewed. The afternoon stretches lazily without the sharp glare of sunshine, somewhat dimmed but pleasantly mild, allowing for a tranquility that invites introspection. Should you venture outdoors, a light jacket and an umbrella will serve as your trustees against the sporadic drizzle. The allure of a nearby coffee shop, where the warm light and steamy windows invite idle reflection with a good book or conversation, is irresistible. Alternately, the charm of a gallery or quiet stroll through a park where nature's musings play overture to your thoughts might be the day's quiet adventure. While bright skies and cheering sun are masked behind gentle clouds, the day\u2019s embrace encourages simplicity and a slower pace, offering an enchanting backdrop for subdued exploration or repose.",
