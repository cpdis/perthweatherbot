    "weather_report": "Twilight ebbs into the nightfall in Subiaco as the clock just past the eighteenth hour. A weathered patina of the sky, which just witnessed broken clouds, now gently reveals less densified, scattered clouds, in various shapes and sizes. The day has been agreeable, with weather's sporadic flirtations, hopping from fluffy to slightly thinner clouds. The sunbeam's clarity was intermittent, smearing the city with ever-changing shadows, playing their own melodies. UV index, a tale garnered from the sun, was comparatively balanced, gracing the skin with the needed warmth. \n\nThe day's emerging evening seems modestly delightful. A playful tussle between the sun and clouds knowingly suggesting a light sweater or a wise wrap around. Mellow, yet not too crisp, the conjectured weather subtly whispers into the ears of wayfarers, hinting at a stroll perhaps, through the innate city lanes, letting the soft weather cradle and amuse their senses. Peaceful, yet pronounced, today's weather essayed a story telling those who live it, to revel in the beauty of the mundane and the loveliness of a simple city stroll the evening through.",
