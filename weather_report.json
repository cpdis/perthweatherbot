    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the air carries a gentle coolness as the sky wears a veil of parted clouds, hinting at a serene night to come. With temperatures dipping toward a refreshing 49 degrees, the north-northwest wind whispers through the streets, occasionally gusting with playful vigor. The city is poised at the edge of winter, where the faint silhouette of the Golden Gate might blend into the coastal mist, creating an ethereal backdrop to the evening.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Tuesday, expect radiant sunshine to bathe the city, warming it to a comfortable high near 64, though a gentle drop in temperature will greet the afternoon. Dress in layers to adjust to shifting conditions; a light jacket would invite comfort against the brisk north wind, while the sun beckons for the lighter touch of spring. With the day unfolding, consider meandering along the Embarcadero, where fresh pastries pair beautifully with the light sea breeze. Alternatively, a quiet stroll through one of the many parks could be the meditation this crisp January air whispers for, offering a moment to embrace the tranquil clarity San Francisco has to offer.",
