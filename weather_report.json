    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a cool whisper of moisture, teased by the possibility of drizzle. The sky, cloaked in a soft blanket of clouds, holds little promise of vibrant sunlight just yet, hinting at an overcast morning that might cling to the day. With temperatures resting in the chill of the early hours, a light jacket could serve as a comforting companion, though layers will prove wise as the day unfolds. \n\nAs the sun rises and the city stirs, there is a modest chance of drizzle lingering until afternoon, but whispers of sunshine herald a gradual shift. The expected high will draw ever closer to a cool 55 degrees, a reminder of the fleeting warmth of the season. If venture beckons, a brisk walk through the streets or a visit to one of the city's quaint coffee shops may elevate spirits, wrapped in the essence of this unique winter morning. The fog, an ever-present character, seems subdued, perhaps retreating to the iconic hills that cradle the city, leaving room for a modest, yet inviting day.",
