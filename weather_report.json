    "weather_report": "Perth steps into late afternoon under a faultless, polished-blue sky. The light is bright but softening, shadows lengthening toward evening. It has been a sun-forward day and remains clear through sunset, with the UV that roared at midday now easing to the gentler end; glare lingers, but the scorch is fading. Air feels dry and clean, visibility crisp enough to read the hills, and the evening promises a quietly radiant sky before stars take over.\n\nDress for ease: breathable fabrics, sunglasses for the low sun, a hat if you\u2019re out before it dips, and a light layer to slip on after dark. This is weather for modest pleasures\u2014an unhurried walk along the river paths, watering the garden and listening to the birds trade shifts, a quick ride to the shops, or an open-window dinner that doesn\u2019t ask for conversation to compete with the breeze. Expect a clear, pleasant night that invites lingering a little longer than planned.",
