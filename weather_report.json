    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle taps on windows, heralding the likely rain that will grace the city. With the air thickening and the sky cloaked in shadowy clouds, the temperature lingers around a mellow 56. The soft winds from the south carry a whisper of coolness, hinting at the more persistent chill of the dampness that envelops the evening. The forecast suggests a continued chance of rain, painting a serene but perhaps slightly melancholic picture of the night, perfect for curling up with a book or indulging in a quiet cup of tea.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, a hint of optimism glimmers with a slight chance of rain after 4 PM, though the overall outlook maintains the moody cloud cover that defines this season. With temperatures inching near 62 before gradually retreating into the cooler embrace of the afternoon, dressing in layers becomes essential. A cozy sweater and a lightweight rain jacket would suit the day\u2019s character, with sturdy shoes ready for the adherence of the slick sidewalks. Conclusive plans? Perhaps a meandering stroll through the fog-veiled streets, peering into the misty treasures of local galleries, or enjoying a tranquil afternoon at a nearby caf\u00e9 where the warmth and aroma of coffee can chase away the cold.",
