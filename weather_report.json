    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco drifts in under a pale, woolly sky, the sun diluted to a soft glow that brightens but does not dazzle. The air feels mild and a touch heavy, hinting at showers that look likely to slip in during the later afternoon and towards early evening as light rain brushes through. Expect only modest sunshine, with the UV softened by cloud yet still worth respecting around lunchtime; a hat and a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray. The day reads as gently unsettled, edges blurred, with visibility clear enough but the light turning silvery and subdued.\n\nDress for ease and changeability: light layers, a breathable shirt, and a compact rain jacket or small umbrella in your bag; comfortable shoes that won\u2019t sulk at damp pavements. It\u2019s a good afternoon to linger over a cafe lunch under an awning, pick up a few small errands, or wander a quiet gallery before the sprinkles arrive. If you crave a stretch of air, take a short amble through the neighborhood now, then retreat indoors for a book or a matinee when the first drops tick the windows.",
