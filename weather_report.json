    "weather_report": "As the evening settles softly upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds stretches across the sky, allowing some stars to twinkle through the twilight. The air is crisp, painting the evening with a serene chill, just above the whisper of the sea. Winds drift lightly from the northwest, barely ruffling the leaves. Tonight\u2019s temperature hovers around a cool 46 degrees, suggesting that a cozy layer or a light jacket would add to one\u2019s comfort while wandering the city\u2019s illuminated streets.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the sun will break through, promising a mostly sunny day with a high near 59 but gradually cooling to about 56 as the afternoon matures. The northern breeze will remain mild, making it an ideal time to enjoy a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps find a quiet caf\u00e9 in which to relish a good book while watching the world drift by. The fog may linger just offshore, shyly cloaking the distant Marin headlands but giving way, allowing for incredible views of the famous skyline and bridges. Whether you're venturing out for a muted brunch or simply taking in the artful sights of the city, the weather offers a pleasant invitation to embrace the day.",
