    "weather_report": "As the afternoon settles over Melbourne, the skies, once layered like a moody masterpiece with broken clouds, now drizzle softly in a symphony of light rain. The radiant sun hides behind the veiled curtain of gray, casting the city in a muted glow where shadows blend seamlessly with the textures of the world. With the cool, damp air filtering through the streets, it's a day that's dressed in subtle contrasts. Wearing layers is a wise choice, perhaps a comfortable sweater under a waterproof jacket, with boots that whisper compliments to the cobbled paths and puddled sidewalks. The UV index whispers insignificance under these watercolor skies, granting you carefree ambles without the sharp stare of the sun. For those venturing out, today's weather beckons introspection, perfect for a cozy corner in a familiar cafe \u2013 perhaps a book in hand, accompanied by the gentle melody of rainfall against windowpanes. Embrace the richness of the overcast sky, the aura of nostalgia it births, and relish in the small rituals of warmth and leisure it invites. Nature's gentle drizzle dances with time, urging us to pause and savor the rhythmic secrets of the passing afternoon.",
