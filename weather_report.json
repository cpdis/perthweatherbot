    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a soft murmuring of light rain begins to whisper through the air, casting a gentle sheen on the bustling sidewalks. The clouds, thick and gray, blanket the sky, promising an intricate dance between precipitation and fleeting patches of sun. Tonight, the temperature hovers around a mild 50 degrees, gradually rising to around 52, with a light southwest breeze brushing against the skin, providing just enough chill to savor the freshness of the moment. The anticipated rainfall\u2014set to unleash between a quarter and half an inch\u2014will come gently, a tender reminder of nature\u2019s rhythm.\n\nLooking towards tomorrow, the promise of rain before the day\u2019s edge will make its presence known; the high of 57 will eventually yield to a cooler, drifting afternoon, as clouds play hide-and-seek with the sun. As the rain transitions to a mix of clouds and sun, the mood remains contemplative yet inviting, perfect for a cozy day spent reveling in the warmth of a beloved caf\u00e9, or perhaps enjoying the soothing sound of raindrops against a window while tucked away with a novel. The city may be wrapped in a cloak of moisture, but with thoughtful layering\u2014soft sweaters and waterproof jackets\u2014the streets await, ready for one to embrace the beauty of a San Franciscan winter day.",
