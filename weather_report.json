    "weather_report": "As noon strikes and the clock ticks on this brisk November day in Downtown San Francisco, a curious interplay of light and cloud fills the air. Wisps of fog cling to the coastline, their spectral forms rolling in from the ocean, casting a gentle shroud that hints at the potent rain promised later. The current sunlight, a fleeting embrace, lights the city's distinct architecture, while the breeze carries whispers of change, teasing the impending storm. The temperature rests comfortably in the low sixties, though a subtle chill creeps in as the clouds gather for their evening performance.\n\nThis afternoon, expect the rain to make its quiet entrance after five, ushered in by a shift to partly sunny skies that will soon drift into an enveloping gray. For those contemplating an outing, perhaps a stroll through the nearby parks would offer a perfect moment to savor the city's unique blend of urban and natural beauty before the droplets transform the scene. Layers are advisable; a light jacket should suffice against the brisk wind that dances through the streets, with gusts hinting at the tempest to come. Embrace the elements, for the city breathes as it prepares for its next act, a beautiful, albeit damp, embrace of winter.",
