A brisk north-northeast wind dances through the streets, occasionally lifting the edges of a jacket, and though the gusts may chill the skin momentarily, they carry with them the promise of a glorious day ahead.\n\nCome Sunday, sunlight will warm the city, promising a high near 61 by midday. The air will retain its crispness, falling gently to about 57 in the afternoon, while the winds will mellow to a tender sweep. Today\u2019s clarity is striking\u2014a moment balmy enough to coax residents outdoors, inviting strolls along the Embarcadero or leisurely coffee on a sunlit terrace. With no fog to smudge the horizon, sights of the Golden Gate Bridge and the shimmering bay are distinctly vibrant. Given these conditions, comfortable layers will be your best friend; a light sweater or shawl would complete the ensemble effortlessly, ideal for an afternoon spent wandering between art galleries and local shops. Embrace the day, as it begs to be explored, offering the promise of inspiration in every sun-soaked corner.",
