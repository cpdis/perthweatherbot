    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon bathes the city in sunlight, wrapping the streets in a gentle glow, inviting passersby to enjoy the clear skies and mild temperatures. With a high approaching 61 degrees, the cool yet crisp embrace of a westerly breeze\u2014ranging between 7 to 14 mph\u2014adds a refreshing touch to the day, rustling the leaves of the trees and encouraging a leisurely stroll. The absence of a marine layer keeps the vistas expansive, offering unobstructed views of the iconic Golden Gate and the city\u2019s skyline, while the horizon melts into an endless azure.\n\nAs twilight approaches, a shift is anticipated; the sun will cast a softer light across the landscape, and with it, partly cloudy skies will take over, introducing a cozy ambiance by evening\u2019s arrival. Expect temperatures to dip to around 51 degrees, prompting a light jacket or sweater to ward off the cool night air. This transition invites possibilities\u2014perhaps a quiet evening walk along the Embarcadero, savoring a warm cup of coffee at a cherished caf\u00e9, or gathering with friends for a casual dinner. The clarity of the day makes it a perfect time to explore the hidden corners of the city, with the charm of autumn whispering through the streets.",
