    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under the soft embrace of a bright and sunny sky, a rare gift for the often fog-laden city. With the temperature gently rising to near 68, it promises a pleasant day, yet as afternoon approaches, a cool breeze will accompany a slight drop to around 63. The North wind whispers through the streets, creating a refreshing backdrop to the morning chatter. Tonight, the skies will remain clear, with the temperature settling around a comfortable 50, ideal for an evening out.\n\nAs the sunlight bathes the city, you might find it inviting to don a light sweater or jacket, especially with the evening chill in the air. This is a perfect day to stroll through the neighborhoods, perhaps visiting a local caf\u00e9 for a morning coffee, or wandering along the waterfront to take in the unobstructed views of the Bay. As the warmth lingers, it\u2019s an ideal time for al fresco lunch, enjoying the blissful clarity of the day. Whether you choose to explore the vibrant streets or simply relax in a park, the day is undeniably pleasant, free of fog and draped in sunshine.",
