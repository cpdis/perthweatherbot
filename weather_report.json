    "weather_report": "Midday in Floreat is bright and uncomplicated: a clean blue vault overhead, sunlight laid across verandas and footpaths, shadows drawn with a ruler. The forecast holds to clear skies through the afternoon into early evening, so it will stay cheerfully sunny and glare-prone, the kind of spring light that sharpens edges. Expect the UV to be high through the early afternoon before easing later, so the day is beautiful but not entirely gentle.\n\nDress light and breathable, with a hat, sunglasses, and a good sweep of sunscreen; keep water nearby. It\u2019s a pleasant day to air the house and let a load of washing dry, to run a small errand on foot, or to sit with a paperback in the shade and let the hours drift. Save a longer walk or an easy spin around the neighborhood for late afternoon when the sun tilts and the light mellows, and the day loosens its grip.",
