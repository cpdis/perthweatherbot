    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, a quilt of broken cloud drifts overhead, muting the last stars and promising a soft, filtered sunrise. The air feels still and slightly cool, the kind that clears the head; visibility is clean, and the light, when it arrives, will be pearly rather than blazing. Early UV is low, and the sun seems set to come and go through gaps in the cloud, offering passing shafts of brightness rather than a steady glare.\n\nExpect a day that leans partly cloudy with intervals of light. If the cloud thins toward late morning, UV will step up quickly, so keep sunglasses handy and a little sunscreen once you\u2019re out and about. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light top with a cardigan or linen overshirt\u2014and shoes made for small wanderings. The mood suits unhurried errands: a quiet walk for a takeaway coffee as the shops stir, a check of the balcony herbs, a spin to post a parcel, or a chapter read by a window while the sky brightens and dims. If you venture out later, favor the shaded side of the street and enjoy the softened clarity of a day that\u2019s more silver-blue than high summer blue.",
