    "weather_report": "Late morning in Houston arrives under a seamless lid of cloud, the light cooled and grainy, colors a shade quieter than usual. The forecast shows overcast carrying in from the night, so sunshine will be scarce; if it glances through at all, expect it to be brief and muted. UV index stays low under this kind of blanket in December, so glare and hard shadows are unlikely. The air feels settled rather than sharp, with the horizon a touch smudged but visibility otherwise fine.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for easy layers: long sleeves, a light jacket or cardigan, maybe a thin shell if you\u2019ll be out for hours, and comfortable shoes. Lean into the gray and do the gentle tasks it favors: a late-morning coffee run, a quiet lap through the grocery, a library hold pickup, tidying a workspace by the window, or a short neighborhood walk to reset the mind if the sidewalks are dry. Sunglasses can stay pocketed; let the soft light set the tempo.",
