    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a cloak of clouds drapes softly across the cityscape, holding the chill of the evening with a whispered promise of serenity. The temperature hovers around a crisp 49 degrees, and a gentle south wind stirs, barely noticeable yet refreshing. The view hints at a quiet blanket of fog hovering just above the water, weaving its tendrils through the Golden Gate, embracing the bay with that characteristic San Francisco mystery. \n\nTomorrow promises a brightening shift as the sun nudges its way through the remnants of the night\u2019s cloud cover, offering a mostly sunny respite from the fog. Highs may flirt with 58, dipping gently by afternoon, with a light north wind accompanying the change in temperature. Dressing in layers will serve well; a light jacket to stave off the briskness of the morning will transition seamlessly into a comfortable sweater for the afternoon sun. With the day unfolding in gentle clarity, leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment with a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 would embrace the city\u2019s charm, allowing residents and visitors alike to savor this moment in time.",
