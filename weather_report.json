    "weather_report": "As daylight gently wanes over Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a lovely afternoon glow, the kind of warmth that calls for a leisurely stroll through its streets. The sun reigns supreme, defining the sky in soft blues, while wisps of marine layer linger at the edges, hinting at the embrace of the ocean. Visibility is good, allowing for stunning views toward the Golden Gate Bridge, where the iconic structure stands against a backdrop of clear skies. Though the temperature is a modest 63 degrees, a slight coolness hints at the oncoming evening, beckoning those out and about to carry an extra layer for comfort.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the clouds will drift in lazily, and the temperature will settle down to around 50 degrees. The breeze, gentle and unhurried, will soothe rather than chill. Today\u2019s weather invites a relaxed pace, perfect for a quiet evening walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps pausing to admire the lights reflecting on the bay or to savor a delicious meal in one of the cozy waterfront restaurants. The day promises a peaceful transition into night, ideal for mingling with friends or seeking solace in a favorite book at a local caf\u00e9, wrapped in a light jacket that shields against the cool air as it begins to roll in softly.",
