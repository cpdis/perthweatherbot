    "weather_report": "The afternoon light in Downtown San Francisco reveals a city draped in clarity, with temperatures gently settling around a cool 56 degrees. The sun casts a soft glow over the skyline, hinting at a pleasant day with just a whisper of wind from the north. However, if one gazes toward the horizon, the remnants of the marine layer linger, softly framing the Golden Gate Bridge in a veil that speaks of the bay\u2019s enigmatic moods. While the clouds lower their embrace elsewhere, the city itself stands mostly clear, inviting residents and visitors alike to step outside and savor the day.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the temperature will cool further to a comfortable 48 degrees, and the skies will transition into a partially clouded canvas illuminated by the final rays of light. It\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or to retire to a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps enjoying a warm drink while watching the subtle transformations of City Hall bathed in the evening glow. For the discerning outfit choice, a light jacket or sweater will suffice to fend off the evening chill, ensuring comfort as your evening unfolds in this vibrant urban landscape.",
