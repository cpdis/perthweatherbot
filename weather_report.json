    "weather_report": "In the heart of Subiaco, the dawn unfolds its chapter with a pleasantly moderate palette of scattered clouds, like an impressionist's canvas brushed with muted strokes of grey. The jovial sun plays coy, shrouded periodically by this stray pageantry of cloud dancers, making fleeting cameos that spill sunlight intermittently onto the waking town. Peek-a-boo rays coax the town awake, the UV index remaining a gentle consort due to the welcomed presence of these celestial veils. The skies possess a clarity that whispers of a day to unfold with a perfect blend of sunshine and shade. \n\nToday in Subiaco, one could capture the essence of the day in a light layered attire, a subtle nod to the dance between the sun and the clouds, a soft sweater over a comfortable shirt suffices. Patrons of the day may find joy in leisurely pursuits that embrace the cool-ish embrace of the diffused sunlight, a stroll through the vibrant local markets, or perhaps, an alfresco breakfast at a beloved street-side caf\u00e9, the scene bathed intermittently in soft sunlight. The day languidly unfurls as a languishing narrative that whispers for you to claim its offerings, proffering an ambiance that deftly balances the gentleness of morning with the vibrancy of midday. Today, Subiaco dons the shade of , a muted light grey reflecting the scattered clouds and peeking sunlight.",
