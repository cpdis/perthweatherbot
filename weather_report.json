    "weather_report": "Late afternoon settles over Centennial Park with a pewter tint; paths are darkened by earlier showers and the air smells of wet grass. Forecasts showed light rain in the morning and midday, and a few more passing sprinkles may drift through before evening. The sun is shy behind a gauze of cloud, so brightness stays muted and the UV remains low, perhaps nudging up only briefly if the ceiling thins. Visibility is softly filtered rather than foggy, giving the lake and lawns a calm, contemplative clarity.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for a light waterproof jacket and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, with a thin layer underneath to guard against the damp. An umbrella helps if you plan to linger. Consider a slow loop by the water to watch ripples stitch the surface, a gentle jog between showers, or a quiet pause under a shelter to listen to the rain tick on the leaves. If you crave sun, today asks patience; if you welcome a quieter mood, the park is yours.",
