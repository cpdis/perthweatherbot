    "weather_report": "A veil of clouds hangs over Downtown San Francisco this morning, cloaking the city in a muted gray. The air carries the crisp scent of impending moisture, hinting at the drizzle forecasted for later in the day. As the morning unfolds, the temperature teeters around a cool 48 degrees, gradually rising to a balmy 62 by afternoon\u2014a deceptive warmth framed against the chill of the breeze rolling in from the south at a modest 6 to 18 mph. The promise of rain lingers, with a 70% chance of delicate drops beginning this afternoon, hushing the city\u2019s rhythm into a reflective tranquility.\n\nFor those contemplating a stroll or errand, dress in layers to navigate the ebb and flow of chill and warmth. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will serve well against wind and possible drizzle. Perhaps explore a local caf\u00e9, watching the world pass by through a fogged-up window, or indulge in a bookstore visit, losing oneself among the pages while the mystical city dances in a misty embrace beyond the glass. Enjoy the day\u2019s embrace as it quietly prepares for the evening's thoughtful intimacy, where the soft illumination of streetlights will glisten on damp pavement, crafting an enchanting atmosphere enveloped in the sounds of gentle rain.",
