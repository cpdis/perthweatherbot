    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco looks clear and easygoing: a blue sky brushed with a few small clouds, sunlight beginning to mellow rather than glare. Expect the rest of the day to stay mostly sunny with only thin patches of cloud toward early evening; visibility is crisp, colors look true, and the air feels uncomplicated. UV had some bite earlier and will sit low to moderate for a short while before slipping to low near sunset, so a hat and sunglasses are sensible if you\u2019re out before dinner, then a light layer will do as the warmth softens. It\u2019s a good time for unhurried errands on foot, a gentle ride to pick up groceries, watering the plants, or sitting outside with a book as the day folds into evening.",
