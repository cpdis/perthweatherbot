    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle sun illuminating the cityscape. A high near 60 degrees brings a pleasant warmth for those navigating the streets, although temperatures may wane slightly as the hours drift by. The skies are mostly clear, allowing the iconic silhouettes of buildings to stand distinctly against a backdrop of blue, the horizon stretching beautifully toward the Golden Gate Bridge. As the sun descends, a soft west wind whispers through, adding a refreshing touch to the air.\n\nCome evening, the clouds will begin to blanket the sky, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle as the night wraps itself around the city, with lows dipping to around 49 degrees. The South Southwest winds will remain calm, creating a soothing atmosphere but also inviting the thought of layering up in a cozy sweater or light jacket for your evening stroll or caf\u00e9 visit. As the daylight gently fades, consider exploring a local bookshop or weaving through the neighborhoods, absorbing the tranquil city vibe before settling into the comfort of home or a favorite hangout.",
