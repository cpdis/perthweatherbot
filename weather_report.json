    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco takes on a moody character, cloaked in a mist of impending rain. The clouds gather softly, anticipating the fall of moisture after the early hours, while a gentle southwest breeze flutters through the streets. The temperature whispers around 47 degrees, a chill that may encourage thoughts of curling up with a warm drink or making plans to meet friends for a cozy evening indoors, as the city comes alive with twinkling lights reflecting on dampened surfaces.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Sunday, the promise of rain continues, with the likelihood of light showers before mid-morning. The high of 57 degrees barely lifts from the cooler embrace of the morning chill, hinting at a day where layers are both a comfort and a necessity. Perhaps a stroll through the quieter corners of the city could be in order, where the soft sound of rain might serenade the senses, or visiting a local caf\u00e9 with a view of the drumming drops, creating an atmosphere perfect for reading, contemplation, or gentle conversation. The marine layer will linger, casting a gentle veil over the bay, softening the edges of the skyline, making this a day best enjoyed at a leisurely pace, letting the weather guide your steps and choices.",
