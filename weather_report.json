    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and laced with a hint of coolness as temperatures dip toward the low forties. The gentle whispers of a north-northeast breeze weave through the streets, offering a serene touch to the evening. Tonight presents a partly cloudy sky, inviting glimmers of starlight to peek through the veil, while the city hums with the distant sounds of nightlife\u2014an urban heartbeat that resonates amidst the solitude.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, San Francisco will awaken to a delicate embrace of patchy fog, lingering along the coastal edges before gradually revealing the sky to a canvas of soft blues. By midday, the sun will begin to assert itself, enticing the day to brighten, although temperatures will drift toward a cooler fifty-eight degrees, receding slightly in the afternoon. It\u2019s a subtle reminder of the city's unique climate\u2014a blend of fog and sunshine that dances across the horizon. Dress for the day in layers; a light jacket will suffice for the morning chill but shed it as the sun warms your shoulders. As you step out, consider sauntering along the Embarcadero or exploring lesser-known galleries and eateries that hum with life on a Wednesday. Perhaps indulge in a quiet coffee while watching the city shake off its slumber, or take a moment to appreciate the juxtaposition of fog lifting and urban structures emerging.",
