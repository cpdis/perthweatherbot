    "weather_report": "Houston wakes to a damp, sleepy hush; yesterday\u2019s light rain has left the streets darkly polished, and broken clouds still loiter in the pre-dawn. The air feels clean rather than sharp, with a faint glimmer toward the east that hints at a shy sunrise. Expect the day to lean more gray than golden, with the sun slipping in and out of gaps rather than taking center stage. UV exposure will be near zero until after sunrise and likely stay on the low side through the morning, nudging to modest only if the cloud deck frays toward midday. Visibility should be decent, though light will be soft and subdued.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for easy layers\u2014light jacket or sweater, closed shoes, maybe a compact umbrella for insurance\u2014and the kind of pace that doesn\u2019t mind a muted sky. An early coffee run, a short errand loop, or a quiet spell at the gym or library fits the mood; later, if a brighter patch opens, a gentle stroll on a dry sidewalk will feel earned. Roads may still be slick in spots, so take the corners with care and let the day unfold without hurry.",
