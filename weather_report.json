    "weather_report": "As the night drapes over Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a thick blanket of clouds, a characteristic shroud that hints at the moisture lingering in the air. The temperature rests gently at around 52 degrees, encouraging a cozy embrace of layers. Although a gentle westward wind whispers through the streets, promising a refreshing chill, a promise of clarity looms for the daylight hours ahead. \n\nWednesday welcomes the morning with partially sunny hours that temporarily lift the spirits. Yet, heed the forecast's hint of rain coming after 5 PM, as an ominous 60% chance may drench the city in the late afternoon. Dress wisely in breathable fabrics layered with a sturdy jacket; these will provide warmth against the lingering marine layer. An invigorating stroll through Golden Gate Park could offer solace as the sun attempts to break through the clouds, giving hints of light across the sky, while the scent of damp earth fills the air. As the day progresses, enjoy a laid-back afternoon perusing the local cafes, keeping an eye on the horizon for the arrival of rain. A flexible plan, perhaps to retreat indoors with a good book or a favorite film, may prove prudent as the clouds thicken and the rain descends.",
