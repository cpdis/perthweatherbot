    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks toward midnight in Downtown San Francisco, a calm serenity envelops the scene. The sky, a tapestry of midnight blue, reveals a clarity that suggests a peaceful night ahead. Low temperatures hover around 45 degrees, promising a gentle rise as the hours pass. A light whisper of wind, shifting from the east southeast, carries the cool promise of the bay, its strength building with gusts reaching towards 30 mph. This brisk air complements the clear conditions, creating an atmosphere ripe for a night stroll along the Embarcadero.\n\nLooking toward Monday, the dawn will bring an embrace of sunshine to the city, warming the air to a high of nearly 59 degrees. The forecast suggests a delightful day, with northeastern breezes keeping the atmosphere refreshingly cool. One might consider wearing layers \u2014 a light jacket perfect for the morning chill, cast aside as the sun rises higher. It\u2019s the kind of day that invites a leisurely walk through Golden Gate Park, perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a quiet moment with a book. The absence of fog allows the iconic sights of the city to shine, beckoning both residents and visitors to enjoy what the day unfolds.",
