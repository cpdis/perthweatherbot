    "weather_report": "As the quaint suburb of Subiaco lies beneath a silvery sky stippled with clouds, the cool, damp air carries whispers of the night's lingering drizzle. The soft patter of rain has ceased, leaving the morning fresh, with pavements glistening under scattered streetlights. The horizon, still murmuring the promise of rain at dawn, has yet to unveil the sun's soft embrace. As the early hours unfold and the steely blue of twilight fades, the day hints at a diffused sky where the sun, veiled by fleet-footed clouds, may shyly step into the scene. While a vivid blue canopy might remain elusive, the gentle light through the clouds offers a respite from the blazing sun, suggesting a subtle charm in the day's mildness.\n\nEnveloping you like a well-worn sweater, the morning invites sensibilities both practical and poetic. A light raincoat paired with sturdy shoes will complement the capricious weather, keeping one comfortable amid the alternating whispers of rain and lull of dry spells. Rejoice in the tranquility the overcast weather brings, ideal for reflective walks or an absorbing read at a corner caf\u00e9, where time seems to pause in the fragrance of freshly brewed coffee. Allow the day to unwind at its own tempo, a canvas for humble joys of observation and introspection. Today, Subiaco quietly suggests that we find elegance in its fragile serenity, and embrace calm in a world that seldom allows it.",
