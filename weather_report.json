    "weather_report": "As San Francisco awakens under a shroud of clouds, the city stands in a gentle embrace of muted hues and soft winds. The chill in the air hints at the low temperatures lingering around fifty-one, slowly inching upward towards fifty-three as the night surrenders to dawn. The Southeast wind whispers through the streets, bringing a salty breath from the bay, while occasional gusts dance to twenty-three miles per hour, swirling leaves and creating a gentle rustle among the city\u2019s many trees. Rain is anticipated before the afternoon, coaxed in by the heavy clouds; a promise of moisture that may grant the earth its much-needed drink, with amounts possibly reaching a quarter of an inch.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the high near sixty beckons a retreat from the brisk dawn, yet there\u2019s a tangible heaviness in the air indicative of the rain's approach. Those who venture outdoors may find the morning cool and breezy, perfect for a layered outfit\u2014perhaps a light sweater under a waterproof jacket to shield against the impending drops. The fog, ever the elusive specter of this coastal city, hangs low in some corners, particularly where the Golden Gate Bridge cloaks itself, blending in with the clouds. The muted light creates a charming atmosphere perfect for a leisurely stroll through the Mission District to appreciate the vibrant street art, or a quiet moment with a hot coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9. For those who prefer the indoors, the impending rain offers a perfect excuse to explore one of the city's many excellent bookstores or art galleries, where the essence of creativity flourishes amidst the cool air and cozy settings.",
