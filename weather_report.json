    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, the evening stands illuminated by a sprinkle of city lights, a testament to the vibrancy lingering in the air. Tonight\u2019s weather unfolds partly cloudy, with a brisk kiss from the north-northwest wind, standing at a modest 43 degrees. The sky, while carrying traces of soft cloud cover, offers glimpses of clarity among the scattered darkness, creating a scene that is both serene and gently mysterious. \n\nTomorrow promises a transformation into sunshine, lifting the spirits as the sun graces the city from dawn till noon, with a high that flirts around 55 degrees, cooling slightly as afternoon sets in. The north-northwest wind will remain a gentle companion, brushing through the streets. Those venturing out may find it wise to dress in layers: a light jacket and a comfortable sweater will serve well, allowing for the impending warmth of the day while providing comfort against the chill of the evening air. With such inviting conditions, a stroll through the neighborhood, a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of tea, or even a leisurely jog along the waterfront, would be splendid ways to embrace the charm of an evening in this capital of cool.",
