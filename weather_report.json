    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into early afternoon under a soft pewter canopy, the sun a faint suggestion behind gauze. The air feels mild and a touch damp; brightness is subdued, and the UV should stay on the low-to-moderate side for winter, with only brief, filtered glints of sun. The day looks gentle rather than grand, clarity a little softened at the edges, colors deepening the way they do before the first drops find the pavement.\n\nLight rain is expected to move through from midafternoon toward early evening, more a polite persistence than a drenching. Dress with easy practicality: a light waterproof shell, comfortable closed shoes, and an umbrella you won\u2019t mind carrying; sunglasses can rest, though a cap may suit the stray bright spell. It\u2019s a day for modest pleasures\u2014walking to the greengrocer between showers, lingering over a bookshop shelf, or settling by a caf\u00e9 window to listen to the rain stitch its quiet pattern across the street.",
