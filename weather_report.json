    "weather_report": "As morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a curtain of gray blankets the city, whispering the promise of rain. Drizzle is expected to taper off soon, giving way to steadier streams of moisture that will envelop the streets, dripping from awnings and pooling in tranquil reflections on the pavement. Anticipate a day where the temperature hovers in the low fifties, accompanied by winds that carry a chill, gusting through neighborhoods with a brisk determination. \n\nVisibility may be limited, with a heavy atmospheric presence that obscures distant views, hinting at a low marine layer that dances just above the water\u2019s edge. Such conditions invite cozy layers\u2014grip a warm coat and perhaps wrap a scarf around your neck as you venture out. The ambiance encourages an afternoon spent in quiet caf\u00e9s, a haven for warmth and conversation, or perhaps a stroll through a visually drenched park where the rain nourishes both earth and spirit. On this drizzly day, let the soft patter of rain on rooftops accompany your thoughts, the city cocooning you in its tranquil embrace.",
