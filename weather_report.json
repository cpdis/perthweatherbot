    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night dawns under a shroud of patchy fog that will soon give way to a day resembling a muted promise of sunshine. As the city sleeps, temperatures rest comfortably around 47, with a gentle whisper of northeast winds. When morning breaks, expect areas of fog to linger until the late hours of the morning, softly masking the golden hues of the skyline. By midday, the sun's light will filter through, painting the day in partial clarity and climbing slowly to a high near 58 before retreating into the cooler embrace of the afternoon.\n\nIn the dim hours before dawn, the city takes on a tranquil quality, muffled sounds echoing through the marine layer, inviting an early riser to don a light jacket over a soft sweater\u2014a fitting attire for the fluctuating temperatures and coastal chill. The day may beckon you to leisurely stroll along the waterfront or savor a quiet moment in one of the local caf\u00e9s, watching as the city awakens and the fog retreats. Engaging in these simple pleasures, one might encounter the charm of a city poised between the serene fog and the promise of a sunlit day, a delicate dance that characterizes this iconic landscape.",
