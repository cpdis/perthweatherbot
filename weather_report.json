    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a gentle and inviting sun, casting a soft glow over the cityscape. With temperatures projected to hover around a mild 54 degrees, there is a pleasing warmth to the morning air, although it will gracefully dip to around 52 by afternoon. The south winds, whispering softly at 2 to 7 mph, add a hint of movement to the day, enhancing the serene atmosphere. As the evening approaches, the sky may grace us with a few drizzles after 4 AM, although the majority of the night will maintain a partly cloudy demeanor, with temperatures easing down to a comfortable 42 degrees, nudging up to 44 overnight.\n\nThe clarity of the day is striking, unmarred by fog or the marine layer that often blankets the city. The golden hues reflected on the Bay and the verdant hills beyond serve as an invitation for leisurely strolls. Given these sanguine conditions, it would be wise to dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater or a long-sleeved shirt, perfect for enjoying a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or savoring a coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while watching the world go by. As the sun dips lower and the evening brings a soft coolness, a light jacket may come in handy, ensuring a cozy end to what promises to be a delightful day in San Francisco.",
