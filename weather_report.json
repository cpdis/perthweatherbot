    "weather_report": "A quiet, predawn cool hangs over Subiaco, the sky swept clean and crystalline, promising a sunrise without fuss. The air feels crisp on the skin, the kind that sharpens edges and makes rooftops and treetops look newly drawn. With clear skies lining up for the morning, the day looks bright and uncomplicated, the sort of clarity that turns shadows inky and colors honest.\n\nExpect abundant sunshine once the light arrives; in early spring the UV climbs quickly, so sunglasses, a hat, and a touch of sunscreen are wise even if the air starts off gentle. Dress in light layers for the chill at first light, shedding to short sleeves by midmorning. It\u2019s a pleasantly straightforward day to walk to the bakery, hang a fresh wash to dry, or give the garden a tidy before the sun grows assertive. Open a window, let the house breathe, and take your coffee outdoors while the light is still soft.",
