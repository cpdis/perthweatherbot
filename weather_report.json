Currently, the weather is clear, with the low settling around 52 degrees, and a gentle north-northwest wind dances through the streets at 15 to 22 mph, hinting at gusts that whip up to 35 mph. Tomorrow promises a sunny respite, reaching a high near 68 before cooling off in the afternoon\u2014a perfect backdrop for the day\u2019s activities. \n\nThe absence of fog reflects the city\u2019s grandeur, allowing for unobstructed views of the hills and bridges as they stand resolute against the dark canvas of the night. With such pleasant weather on the horizon, a light jacket would suffice for the evening chill, while layers will serve well for the day's warmth\u2014think a soft sweater to transition through the afternoon's mild embrace. As one considers activities, an evening stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 could evoke a sense of community amidst the city's quiet energy. Tomorrow, a leisurely bike ride or a visit to the local markets could enrich the day, making for a harmonious blend of the urban pulse and the serenity of autumn's charm.",
