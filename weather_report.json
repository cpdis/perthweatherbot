    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a quiet, lucid night, the sky mostly clear and the streets wearing that soft midnight hush. UV is effectively nil now, the stars unblunted, the air feeling clean around the edges. Toward the small hours, a few clouds begin to drift in, the kind that slip past without drama and let the first light through.\n\nBy dawn, expect scattered cloud with broad strokes of sunshine breaking it up; the day should look bright more often than not, and the UV will climb quickly after breakfast, so think hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out a while. It feels like a light-layers morning: a soft jumper for the early chill, easy to shed as the light gathers. This is good weather for the ordinary pleasures\u2014an early dog walk, a quiet ride to the bakery, watering the garden before the sun bites, or an amble to the train with coffee in hand. If you\u2019re awake now, a short stretch on the porch suits the hour; later, let the windows open to the breeze and keep errands unhurried.",
