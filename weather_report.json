    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, predawn hush, the sky already paling at the edges and promising a clean, transparent day. The air is gentle for now and the streets feel unhurried; in a little while the sun will lift, shadows will sharpen, and the light will turn bright and unambiguous, with no hint of haze.\n\nExpect a sun-forward day with a crisp, blue clarity and little to interrupt it. As the morning matures the UV will climb quickly and be fierce by midday, so think light layers you can shed, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and faithful sunscreen. It looks like a pleasant start for a short walk to the corner bakery, watering the herbs before the heat sets in, or an easy cycle to work while the air is still kind. Run outdoor errands early, then trade the noon glare for shade and a cool drink, or a quiet chapter on a verandah. Later, as the light softens again, a simple stroll home will feel just right.",
