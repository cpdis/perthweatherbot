    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is polished and quiet, the kind of clear that makes stars look newly minted. The forecast keeps it cloudless through the small hours, which means a transparent dawn and a bright, uncomplicated day ahead. UV is essentially absent now, but under that early spring sun it will build quickly by late morning, so expect a sunny start with sharp light and very good visibility. It feels cool at this hour; a light jacket or soft sweater suits the night, then lighter layers, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen once the day gets going. The mood is pleasant and unhurried now, becoming crisp and vivid after sunrise.\n\nIf you\u2019re awake, step onto the verandah for a slow breath and the hush of the neighborhood, or finish a chapter by the window and set out tomorrow\u2019s things. At first light, a gentle walk to fetch bread, a tidy-up of the garden before the sun bites, or an early errand will pair nicely with the clear, dry air; by midday, seek patches of shade and keep the water bottle close. Spring edges in quietly, and the day looks set to oblige with simple, honest sunshine.",
