    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm permeates the early hours, the night having surrendered to a clear sky, the temperature resting softly around 47 degrees. As the sun prepares to kiss the horizon, the day ahead promises the warmth of sunshine, reaching a pleasant high of 62 by afternoon. With a north wind whispering its way through the streets at around 7 mph, the air is inviting, stirring the soul toward possibility.\n\nWhile the marine layer may linger at the edges, its embrace is light and retreating, leaving the city bathed in clarity. As day breaks, there\u2019s no oppressive fog to dampen the spirit; instead, a crispness lingers, making it an ideal morning for a stroll beneath the glorious blue backdrop. Those venturing out would do well to wear layers, perhaps a light sweater or jacket that can be easily shed as the sun climbs higher. Consider a midday jaunt to a quiet caf\u00e9, where you can savor a warm drink while observing the vibrant pulse of life. Alternatively, a leisurely walk along the waterfront beckons, offering a refreshing brine in the air and the promise of scenic views, an unpretentious invitation to embrace the charms of this beautiful city.",
