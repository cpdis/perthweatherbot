    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is crisp and clear, with a gentle pull of cool air invigorating the night. The temperature is set to dip around 56 degrees, while a substantial north wind sweeps through the city at 25 mph, its gusts dancing close to 43 mph. It\u2019s a night free of fog, allowing the glittering city lights and the distant silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge to emerge brightly against a deepening sky. \n\nCome Wednesday, expect a sunlit canvas where golden warmth brushes against the skin, reaching a high of 69 before conceding to a gentle decline around 64 in the afternoon. Winds will continue to add a rhythmic freshness, swirling from the north-northeast, and reinforcing that unmistakable San Francisco charm. Dressing in layers would be wise\u2014a light jacket for the brisk morning and perhaps a soft shirt for the warmth of midday would provide comfort as you immerse yourself in the city\u2019s rich textures. Consider a stroll through the quieter streets or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the laughter of friends. This day invites you to seize simple pleasures, reconnecting with the city's heartbeat amidst the backdrop of its stunning vistas.",
