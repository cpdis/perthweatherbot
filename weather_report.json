    "weather_report": "As the early morning quiet lingers over Downtown San Francisco, the sky offers a tentative embrace of partially obscured clouds, hinting at a gentle glint of sunlight yet to make its full entrance. The chill clings closely, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s, accompanied by a brisk northeast wind that rustles the leaves and tugs at coats. You might catch a fleeting drizzle before dawn, a soft reminder of the night just passed, but it will soon yield to the warmth of a sunny Sunday. As the day unfolds, expect the high to flirt with a cool 57 degrees, gradually settling to a more subdued 55 in the afternoon.\n\nThe atmosphere may feel crisp, yet the promise of clear skies evokes a sense of rejuvenation, as the fog, typically a steadfast companion in these parts, seems to have taken a holiday. The clarity suggests a day ripe for exploration, best enjoyed with layered attire\u2014a light sweater or hoodie beneath a windbreaker would perfectly balance comfort and readiness against the occasional gusts. Take the chance to wander along the Embarcadero or find solace at a caf\u00e9, with a warm beverage cradled in your hands as you soak in the tranquil pulse of the city. The streets will welcome the day with open arms, whispering tales of discovery to those willing to step outside into its embrace and take advantage of this uniquely serene moment.",
