    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a somber mist blankets the city today, with thick clouds hanging low and a steady drizzle accompanying the chill in the air. The gentle patter of rain, relentless and heavy, invites introspection as gusts of wind carry the scent of the sea through the streets. Visibility is diminished, the outlines of familiar landmarks shrouded in a veil of gray. The Golden Gate Bridge, often a beacon of beauty, dissolves into obscurity as the fog creeps in from the ocean, creating a sense of isolation amidst the urban landscape.\n\nDressing for this kind of day leans towards warmth and water-resilience\u2014a comfortable rain jacket, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater, paired with sturdy footwear. As this rainy morning transitions into the evening, the temperatures will only rise slightly, hinting at a night where the rain continues its gentle symphony. While the outside world may not be alluring, it\u2019s a fitting time for quiet activities\u2014perhaps immerse yourself in a book at home, savoring a warm cup of tea, or engage in the artistry of cooking, with the rain as your soft background music. The city's heartbeat continues beneath the rain-soaked streets, inviting a moment of respite within its embrace.",
