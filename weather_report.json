    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a soft, pewter sky at midday, the light already dimmed as if someone drew a sheer curtain across the sun. The afternoon looks set to gather itself into steady rain, picking up around midafternoon before slackening to a gentler patter toward early evening. Sunshine will be scarce and pale; with the cloud deck thickening, the UV will be kept in check, though the odd brighter break could still nip at exposed skin. The air feels clean but subdued, edges of buildings softened, the day more about quiet errands than spectacle.\n\nDress for a cool, damp turn: a light waterproof, shoes that don\u2019t flinch at puddles, and a small umbrella for the walks between places. If you have outdoor tasks, take them on now before the rain steadies; otherwise let the weather choose for you\u2014duck into a gallery for an hour, nurse a coffee by the window, sort a bookshelf, or take a short amble under awnings and eaves. Commuting is fine, just leave time for slick pavements. If the clouds briefly lift, step out for a quick breath of brightness, but expect the afternoon to settle back into its gentle, rain-brushed hush.",
