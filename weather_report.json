    "weather_report": "As the night drifts quietly into the early hours, Subiaco wraps itself in a cloak of tranquil skies. Beneath the velvet darkness, the stars shimmer with unobstructed clarity, suggesting a day ahead kissed by the sun's gentle caress. The clear heavens portend a beautifully luminous day, painted with strokes of soft brilliance and a chorus of light whispers from a breezy, benevolent sky. Though it's still night, the dawn promises a hint of crisp coolness, perfect for drawing in deep, refreshing breaths. As the sun peeks over the horizon, you might find solace in the simplicity of a light sweater, shedding it easily as the day unfolds into mild warmth.\n\nThe UV index whispers a cautionary tale to those who venture out as the day progresses. You might want to slip on a hat with a wide brim, the kind worn by those who enjoy wandering through farmers' markets \u2013 leisurely inspecting heirloom tomatoes and listening to the rustle of fresh leaves at their fingertips. Such are the days meant for little else than savoring the world at your own pace. Perhaps, as the morning matures, you might stroll through a nearby park or simply sit on a bench, a book or your thoughts as your only companions. Embrace the serenity of the day, knowing it will unfold like a silent screenplay, unrushed and bathed in the subtle glow of this clear-skied dawn.",
