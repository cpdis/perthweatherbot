    "weather_report": "South Perth wakes under a spotless sky, the river and rooftops already taking on that late-summer gleam. The morning feels open and uncomplicated, with light sharpening by the minute; by late morning into early afternoon the sun will be unfiltered and insistent, the kind that makes colors ring. Expect a very bright, cloudless day, with UV rising quickly toward the harsh end of the scale around midday, the air clear enough to see every distant edge.\n\nDress for clarity and glare: light fabrics, a broad hat, sunglasses, and generous sunscreen, or a loose long sleeve if you\u2019ll be out for more than a few minutes. It\u2019s a pleasant start for a quick walk along the foreshore or a coffee on a shaded veranda, then errands that don\u2019t leave you squinting on the pavement once the sun finds its stride. Hang the washing early and it will dry in a blink; tend a plant or two before retreating indoors for the brightest stretch, perhaps with a book by a cool window. Later, as the angle softens, a quiet spin to the shops or a gentle stroll will feel right, the city humming, the sky still a calm, unwavering blue.",
