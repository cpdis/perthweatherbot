    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a quiet, predawn veil: a few clouds loitering, the air unhurried, the streets holding their breath before the kettle boils. As the light comes on, expect the sky to turn patchy-blue with scattered clouds drifting lazily and letting the sun through often. It should feel bright and clean, with good visibility and a pleasant, open clarity. UV will be low now, rising quickly after sunrise and likely strong by late morning, so sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen will earn their keep; a light layer over short sleeves suits the cool start and the warming day.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of morning for ordinary pleasures: carry the post on foot instead of driving, hang a small wash to catch the first sun, or take a short loop past the shops before the bustle. Later, open a window and let the breeze stir the rooms, water the herbs, and save the longer stroll for mid-morning shade breaks. Calm, bright, and largely well-mannered weather\u2014easy to live with and easy to like.",
