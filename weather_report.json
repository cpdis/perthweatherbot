    "weather_report": "Early afternoon in Osborne Park arrives under a clean blue sky, only a few modest clouds wandering through the light. The sun feels decisive and bright, the sort that sharpens edges and deepens color; UV is fierce now, so skin and eyes will want shelter. The air reads clear and uncomplicated, a day that invites you out while reminding you to move thoughtfully through the glare.\n\nExpect the sunshine to hold through the afternoon with just scattered cloud, softening toward evening. A light breeze may take the edge off the warmth. Choose breathable clothing, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen, and keep some water at hand. It\u2019s a good time for small, ordinary pleasures: walking errands under shaded shopfronts, letting fresh laundry drink in the dry air, or a quiet coffee outside beneath an awning. Save anything strenuous for later, when the light cools and the day relaxes.",
