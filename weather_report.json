    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a gentle chill, wrapping around the city like a soft blanket. The sky, partly cloudy, offers hints of starlight peeking through, while a light breeze whispers from the west south-west, maintaining an easy-going cadence. With temperatures settling around 45 degrees, the atmosphere is crisp yet invigorating, inviting a stroll through the quieter streets where city lights twinkle against the dark.\n\nTomorrow, promises of a partly sunny day will greet San Francisco, though the afternoon will see temperatures dip to around 51 degrees, creating a subtle shift in the day. The clarity is a mix of soft light and shadows, hinting at the possibility of fog curling back toward the coastline, while the marine layer still lingers in the distance. One might consider dressing in layers: a light sweater under a jacket would strike a balance, ensuring comfort against any wayward breezes. With these conditions, tomorrow beckons for mundane pleasures\u2014wander the local markets, perhaps, or grab an espresso from a corner caf\u00e9, making the most of this slowly unfolding day.",
