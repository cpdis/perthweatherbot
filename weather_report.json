    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Katy, the sky is a soft lid of overcast, streetlights puddling in the quiet and the air reading as cool and a touch damp. Sunshine will be scarce when morning comes; the day looks locked in gray, with the UV index staying low and the light staying gentle and diffuse rather than sharp. Clarity should be steady\u2014no glare, no drama\u2014just a muted, even canvas.\n\nIt\u2019s a modest, practical kind of day. Pull on light layers\u2014a soft sweater or light jacket\u2014and, if you run cool, a scarf for good measure. This weather suits unhurried errands, a window-side coffee, tending to houseplants, or a slow neighborhood walk with a podcast. At this hour, it\u2019s a fine time to straighten the desk, make tomorrow\u2019s list, or let a chapter of something quiet carry you toward sleep. Expect little in the way of sun and no need for sunglasses; the world will arrive in calm, low-contrast tones.",
