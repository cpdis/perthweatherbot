The streets, though dimly lit, come alive with the soft glow of distant lamps reflecting off slick pavements, whispering secrets of the bustling day soon to fade into memory. As dawn approaches, expect a quiet awakening; the chill in the air suggests layering will be wise\u2014think light jackets and perhaps a warm scarf to ward off the briskness that often settles in at night. \n\nSunday will unfurl with a promise of clarity, as the sun casts its warm glow over the city, transitioning from crisp morning fog to a gentle half-light. With temperatures rising but lingering in the cooler spectrum, plan your day with leisure in mind; perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor the day's first coffee while watching the world come alive. In this tranquil setting, every moment becomes an invitation to simply be, to exist amidst the charm of a city rich in character and softened by the embracing fogs of dawn.",
