    "weather_report": "Beneath the cerulean sky, Downtown San Francisco basks in a modest embrace of sunshine. Today unfurls under a mostly clear canopy, a refreshing break from the typical winter haze. As the sun climbs, it warms the air, with the temperature gently reaching around 58 degrees, inviting locals to savor the outdoors before the afternoon coolness settles in, ushering the thermometer down to a crisp 55. A slight northwest breeze rustles the leaves, whispering promises of a pleasant day ahead. \n\nAs twilight draws near, a veil of partly cloudy skies will mingle with the sunset, offering a soft backdrop perfect for evening strolls. Tonight\u2019s low hovers comfortably around 49, and the north-northwest winds may deliver brisk gusts, a reminder of winter\u2019s presence in this spirited city. With temperatures dipping, layering is advisable; a light jacket paired with a scarf will be suitable against the cool evening air. Consider an unhurried walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the warm glow of lights welcomes you in from the brisk night air. Today\u2019s stunning clarity and gentle warmth pave the way for a refreshing blend of leisure and comfort.",
