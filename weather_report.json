    "weather_report": "Denmark wakes under a soft, pewter ceiling: the streets still glisten from a light night rain, and the air feels cool and calm in the bluish hour before dawn. The day looks largely cloud-led, with little in the way of true sunshine; if the sun appears, it will be a pale blur behind the overcast. UV will stay muted, and the clarity is steady if subdued, the edges of buildings and fields slightly washed, the distance more suggestion than detail.\n\nDress in easy layers with a light waterproof or windproof shell, shoes that don\u2019t mind damp pavements, and carry a small umbrella if you\u2019re out long. It\u2019s a day for unhurried errands and quiet comforts: an early bakery run, a tram ride with a book, a tidy-up of the desk before the world stirs, or a brisk walk by the water where the gray light makes everything feel deliberate and calm. If plans take you outside later, expect a cool, subdued mood rather than sparkle; lean into it and let the day be gentle.",
