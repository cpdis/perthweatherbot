    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into a clear, untroubled night, the sky rinsed clean and glassy, stars pricking through as the heat of the day ebbs away. Forecasts keep it cloudless through late evening and into the small hours, so the air will feel pleasantly cool rather than cold, and the UV is effectively asleep until morning; if this clear spell holds after sunrise, expect a frank, sunlit start and a quick climb in UV typical of early October. It\u2019s a good night for light layers and a soft sweater if you linger outdoors, no need for rain gear, just comfortable shoes and an easy stride. Take a gentle loop around the block, give the dog a last, unhurried walk, or sit on the veranda with a book and let the quiet do its work; if you\u2019re planning tomorrow, set out a hat and sunscreen by the door and call it foresight rather than fuss.",
