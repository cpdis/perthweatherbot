    "weather_report": "As the clock passes two in the morning on May 10th, the air in Gnarabup is lightly brushed by an enigmatic curtain of scattered clouds that hints at the tease of dawn still hours away. A gentle drizzle whispers its way into the early hours, gifting the land a serene patter that promises a soft awakening beneath an overcast sky. The sun remains elusive today, masked by the tender embrace of grey, yet this softer light tempts a subtle vibrance, if not for the UV index, which is mercifully low\u2014a lazy veil of mist lending an ethereal charm to the morning. Shafts of filtered light might break through sporadically, a painter's brush dancing over the landscape. It's a day best suited for introspective strolls along the beach where the sound of the soft waves echoes tranquility, or perhaps an inspired retreat to a cozy corner with a book. Practicalities dictate a cup of something warm, a raincoat within reach, and shoes that greet puddles with indifference. The day offers a muted beauty, a quiet masterpiece inviting contemplation and modest pursuits. Allow it to envelop you in its gentle cloak as you move through its expanse.",
