    "weather_report": "Daglish leans into a cloudless late afternoon, the sky a clear, polished blue and the sun still with some bite as it tilts toward evening. It has been a bright, dry day and remains so; the UV would have been fierce at midday and is easing now, but a little sting lingers until the light softens. Visibility is clean and far-reaching, edges crisp, with a gentle breeze that makes the warmth pleasant rather than overbearing. The forecast into early evening stays serenely clear, promising a soft, golden fade to twilight and a calm, starry night.\n\nDress light and breathable, with a hat and sunglasses if you\u2019re out before sunset; sunscreen is still sensible for a late errand or walk. As the air cools, a thin layer tossed over the shoulders will do. These are hours made for unhurried things: watering the garden while shadows lengthen, a quiet loop around the block, cycling to pick up a few groceries, or sitting by an open window with a book as the day sighs toward night. If you have laundry, the air will finish it quickly; if you have plans, keep them outdoors and unhurried.",
