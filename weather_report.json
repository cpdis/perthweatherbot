    "weather_report": "A glorious morning envelops Downtown San Francisco, the sun casting its gentle warmth over the city, revealing the charming blend of architecture and nature. The visibility is excellent, with the expansive blue sky serving as a canvas, setting the stage for a splendid day ahead. In places, the breeze flows briskly, whispering promises of a cool yet invigorating afternoon. As the day warms slightly from a fresh start in the upper 50s, the air remains crisp, a reminder of the season's transition, urging locals to enjoy the day\u2019s offerings.\n\nTonight, the charm continues under mostly clear skies, perfect for quiet strolls through the neighborhood or a casual gathering with friends over warm drinks. With a low expected around 44, a light jacket or sweater would be ideal for the evening chill. The absence of fog both today and tonight allows for unencumbered views across the Bay, a beautiful invitation for a cozy evening, perhaps paired with a leisurely walk along the waterfront, taking in the delicate changes in the city as the sun sets.",
