    "weather_report": "In the quiet early hours of this July day in Subiaco, the air is soft, misted with a gentle drizzle that quells the dust and invites a certain reflective stillness. Light rain, like the interludes of a symphony played on repeat, has graced the evening hours, bringing with it a hushed tranquility that lingers into the late night. The sky above is a swath of muted grey, with the promise of clouds that may break later, but for now, sunbeams are a distant hope. Though the sun will likely play hide and seek behind the persistent clouds today, the cloak of an overcast sky means protection from a punishing UV index, allowing one to move comfortably in the open air. \n\nDressing for this day invites thoughtful layers\u2014a soft, absorbent top beneath a light raincoat, coupled with snug, waterproof footwear. It's a day fashioned for those who enjoy the ambiance of raindrops pattering against windows, encouraging leisurely indoor pursuits. Consider a book with well-worn pages or the gentle hum of a radio to accompany your morning. The day suggests itself to quiet endeavors\u2014a wandering walk beneath the protective canopy of trees, their leaves whispering the secrets of rain to those willing to listen. Yet, an umbrella might be a thoughtful companion for such a stroll. Today is an ode to introspection and gentle activities that align with the rhythm of the raincoated dawn.",
