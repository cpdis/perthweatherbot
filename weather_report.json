    "weather_report": "As the early hours of Sunday unfold, Downtown San Francisco stands enveloped in a gentle embrace of serene cloud cover and soft breezes. With a low temperature hanging around a brisk 44 degrees, the city exudes a certain tranquility, yet whispers of a lingering coolness permeate the air. The panorama reveals a crisp clarity, although a hint of fog clings stubbornly to the fringes, lending a dreamy quality to the view, particularly by the water\u2019s edge.\n\nAs the sun rises higher, it will cast warmth onto the streets, transforming the day into a mix of sunshine and lingering clouds. Expect a high near 54, subtly dipping as the day progresses. Wisps of wind, blowing from the west-northwest, may rustle the leaves and whisk away the morning haze, providing a refreshing touch to the atmosphere. For those venturing out, a light jacket will suffice against the cool air, and a scarf may be the ideal companion for added comfort. Consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the mist meets the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate, or perhaps indulge in a quiet morning at a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm cup while watching the city awaken\u2014a modest yet beautiful way to greet the day.",
