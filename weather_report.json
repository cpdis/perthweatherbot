    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with a gentleness that belies the rain forecasted for later. The morning is partly sunny, yet there\u2019s a quiet anticipation in the air, as if the clouds are gathering their thoughts. The streets are a mix of warmth and coolness, urging residents to step outside while still wrapped in a light jacket\u2014layers will be your ally today. As the sunlight filters through, it dances upon the resilient facades of the city, yet has already started to give way to an encroaching marine layer, obscuring distant hills and softening the outlines of the Golden Gate.\n\nAs the sun inches towards its zenith, temperatures will hover around that familiar chill, particularly as the afternoon winds whisper from the south. The evening promises a shift, and by nightfall, the forecast comes into play: rain will arrive, bringing a soothing rhythm to the bustling city as it finds its way home. With an 80% chance of precipitation and a brisk breeze that flirts with the falling temperatures, it is advisable to prepare for a cozy evening indoors or, for the adventurous, a thoughtful walk under a canopy of clouds, perhaps finding refuge in a caf\u00e9 where the aroma of roasted beans can invigorate the spirit. It is a day best spent without haste, savoring the little pleasures as the city transitions from lingering sunlight to the embrace of a rainy night.",
