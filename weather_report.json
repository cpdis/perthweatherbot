    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in a gentle veil of patchy fog, whispering through the streets and curling around familiar landmarks. The night air is cool, sliding just under 50 degrees, while a soft northeast wind offers a delicate caress, barely disrupting the serene atmosphere. Such conditions invite one to draw on layers, perhaps a light sweater or a cozy jacket, as the city prepares for the ebb and flow of fog that defines its charm.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday morning, expect a lingering embrace of fog that may obscure the skyline until late morning, before the sun breaks through, casting a soft glow over the city. With temperatures expected to hover near 58 degrees, then dipping into a tender coolness by afternoon, it will be a day best enjoyed with the comfort of a scarf or a light coat. Consider a stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s where warmth and camaraderie await in a city that hums gently beneath its fog-laden skies. Perhaps, a leisurely walk through the Presidio will provide moments of tranquility, an escape into nature half-hidden by the mysterious marine layer.",
