    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a clear, untroubled evening, the sky rinsed clean and steady, with stars beginning to prick through the darkening blue. Earlier would have been a bright, open day with full sun and the kind of assertive UV Perth is known for, but by this hour the sting has slipped away to nothing, leaving only calm air and a sense of ease. Expect the night to stay cloudless and quiet, the clarity holding until late. It feels pleasant rather than chilly, a night for light layers and comfortable shoes, maybe a soft jumper draped over the shoulders if you linger. A gentle stroll to the corner for milk, watering the garden while the heat memory drains from the paving, or reading on the veranda with the windows open would suit the mood; if you\u2019re headed out, keep it simple and unhurried, the kind of evening that does not rush anyone.",
