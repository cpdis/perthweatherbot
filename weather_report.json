    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, the streets glisten and the eaves whisper; a light rain is on, with low cloud muting the edges of everything. The sun will be slow to show, if at all this morning, and the UV is low for now. Expect showers around daybreak and into the early hours, with a soft, pewter light and hazy clarity that smooths out the skyline; if the cloud thins later, there may be brief, pale breaks and a modest bump in UV around midday, but the day favors grey over glare.\n\nDress for damp comfort: a light waterproof layer, closed shoes, and something you won\u2019t mind brushing against wet leaves. Carry a compact umbrella, more talisman than shield. It\u2019s a good morning to take the train instead of the bike, to slip under shopfront awnings for a loaf and a coffee, to handle small errands and let the rain pace your steps. If the ceiling lifts later, a short walk between showers will feel earned; otherwise, keep to indoor plans that don\u2019t mind a steady patter at the window.",
