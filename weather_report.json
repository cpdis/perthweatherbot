    "weather_report": "As dawn gives way to morning in Subiaco, the day emerges wrapped in an unyielding blanket of overcast clouds. The sky is a canvas of grey, dashing hopes of sunlit vistas, and the day seems to tiptoe along the edge of rain without quite committing. The clouds cast a soft, diffuse light, offering a muted clarity that subdues vibrant colors, replacing them with a world slightly less vivid but somehow more contemplative. It's a morning for introspection, perfect for quiet walks beneath the shield of towering branches or a meandering exploration of local, less-trodden paths. While the sun's warm embrace might hide behind thick layers today, it's the kind of weather where a comfortable sweater will cocoon you in much-needed warmth. As the hours drift lazily along like spring time turned down a notch, the likelihood of a bright noon or an uplift in the UV index remains faint. However, this softly solemn setting embodies a different kind of beauty\u2014where the rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds become more pronounced as the persistent grey encourages you to listen a little harder, look a little closer. Abandon any plans for sunbathing and instead, find comfort indoors with a good book or perhaps engage the neighborhood's familiar cafes, knowing that beneath the clouds, a day still unfolds as anything but dull.",
