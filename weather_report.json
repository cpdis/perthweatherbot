    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of a December morning, the air in Downtown San Francisco tends to hold onto the remnants of night, adorned with a whisper of fog that blankets the city\u2019s edges. As dawn breaks, the low murmur of patchy fog will gradually yield to a day that promises a mix of muted clouds and moments of sun. The early chill invites one to wrap a light jacket around their shoulders, perhaps paired with a soft scarf to fend off the coolness that clings to the skin. \n\nBy midday, the sun is expected to peek through, casting golden hues that dance over the city's iconic silhouette. The temperature will hover comfortably in the mid-fifties, but as the afternoon unfolds, the retreating warmth will be tempered by a gentle north wind, reminding us of the coastal influence that graces this vibrant locale. With the fog retreating, it\u2019s an ideal time to indulge in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or meander through the streets of the Mission District, perhaps stopping to browse at local shops or savor a quiet moment in a cozy caf\u00e9. Embrace the briskness of the day, and let the city's charm reveal itself in its own understated beauty.",
