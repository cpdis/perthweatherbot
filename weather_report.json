    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with a glassy, uncomplicated sky; stars look newly minted and the air feels clean on the lungs. Forecasts keep it clear through the late hours, so there\u2019s no mystery about the next stretch: calm, dry, and invitingly crisp. UV is negligible now; if this pattern carries into morning, expect a bright, unfiltered sunrise and the sort of quick climb in UV that asks for sunscreen and a bit of shade by mid-morning. Clarity is the theme, with good visibility and a quiet hush that makes the streets seem wider.\n\nDress for a gentle chill: a light coat or warm jumper, maybe a scarf if you linger outdoors. It\u2019s a good evening for a small errand on foot or a slow loop of the block, then leaving a window cracked while you putter in the kitchen. Set out what you\u2019ll need for an early start\u2014hat, water bottle, a plan\u2014so you can step into that likely bright morning without fuss.",
