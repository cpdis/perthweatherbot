    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into the small hours under a clean, quiet sky, the kind of clear darkness that sharpens the silhouettes of rooftops and trees. The forecast keeps faith with this clarity through dawn, and the day ahead looks bright and well-defined, a sky polished to a shine. Expect a generous, unfiltered sun once it rises; the UV will ramp up quickly by late morning, so the light will feel strong and honest rather than harsh, lending everything a crisp edge.\n\nDress for the cool start and the warming glide into daytime: light layers you can shed, breathable fabrics, and a hat or sunglasses tucked in your bag, with sunscreen as your quiet companion. It\u2019s a good morning for a short walk to the bakery or a lazy coffee on the verandah, windows open to let the air move through. As the sun gathers, run a few errands on foot, water the garden, hang a wash that will dry without fuss, or steal an hour with a book in a patch of shade. Evening should return to calm and glassy, perfect for a gentle stroll after dinner if you\u2019re inclined.",
