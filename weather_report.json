    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past two in the afternoon in beautiful Perth, the heavens are adorned with an exquisite scattering of silver clouds, painting a picture of tranquillity against the clear sapphire sky. The morning began with the sun at her peak, casting a glistening glow over the cityscape and dispelling the remnants of night's chill. Now, as the sun recedes, the weather has cooled somewhat, momentary shadows playing hide-and-seek with the sun's light streaming between the clouds.\n\nIn light of the breezy, sun-filled day we are enjoying, light, airy clothing would be the order of the day. A sunscreen with a healthy SPF rating would be a judicious choice, given the slightly high UV index the day began with. An unhurried, leisurely stroll through any of Perth's idyllic parks or gardens would be most delightful during these temperate hours. Equally, a mild potter about the home or office would be well-complimented by the soothing, harmonious weather outside, making for a most agreeable day under the Western Australian sun.",
