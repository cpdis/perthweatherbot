    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night unfolds with a soft embrace of partly cloudy skies and a coolness settling in, as temperatures dip toward the mid-40s. The gentle north-east breeze whispers through the streets, offering a hint of briskness to the air. While the city often experiences fog's embrace, tonight is refreshingly clear, with no thick marine layer obscuring the iconic skyline or the Golden Gate. \n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, expect a canvas painted in shades of sunny gold. The high will flirt with sixty degrees, perfect for a brisk morning walk through Golden Gate Park or a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero where the early sun casts long shadows against the bay. Light layers will serve well; perhaps a light sweater over a tee for comfort, allowing the warmth of the sunlight to greet you without the chill clinging too long. As the day unfolds, the city invites you to explore its nooks\u2014visit a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or delight in a quiet moment at one of the many hidden gardens, savoring the serene aftermath of the holiday celebrations.",
