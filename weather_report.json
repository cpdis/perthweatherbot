    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco wears a single sheet of pewter. The sun is more rumor than presence, its sharpness gone and the UV bite easing as evening draws near. The light is flat and forgiving, colors softened, the horizon a little gauzy. Expect the overcast to hold through the commute, then gather itself into a polite, fine rain after dark; streets will feel dim a touch early under the cloud, with the air turning cooler and damp.\n\nDress in easy layers with a light waterproof and shoes suited to wet pavement; a compact umbrella is worth a pocket. With glare absent, sunglasses can stay behind, and a hat is optional. It\u2019s a good hour to close out nearby errands, pick up something simple for supper, or sit by a cafe window and watch the first drops stipple the glass. If you\u2019d like a small ritual, take a short walk while the sky still only threatens, then catch the train home and let the ordinary evening arrive on time.",
