    "weather_report": "The sun has officially set over Subiaco; the promised clear skies are manifesting in the darkening heavens as the twinkle of distant stars begins to peek through. The cool hues of fading light cast an eerie calm over the tranquil city, the remains of a day spent under the gentle embrace of a sun-soaked sky. The clarity of the day was as impeccable as diamonds scattered across velvet, no protest to be found from even the most reclusive of cloud.\n\nThe remainder of the evening in Subiaco promises similar serenity, weather as gentle as silken whisper, ideal for those looking to mingle in moonlight or perhaps find quieter avenues of solitude. There's a coolness promised with the night; however, it's nothing a modestly warm jacket coupled with the company of a good book, or even better, a fascinating companion couldn't remedy. Take this as a gentle cue from Mother Nature herself to take a leisurely walk under the stars, soak in the cool air, and perhaps philosophize a bit about the secrets held by the universe above. Do remember to leave no room for regrets by dressing a little warmer than you\u2019d think necessary; the night can sometimes hold an unexpected chill in her grasp. Feel the day softly segue into night, wrapped in the quiet allure of clear skies, and let the tranquility wash over you.  \n\nAs for the color, consider ; the rich hue of a deep, night sky.",
