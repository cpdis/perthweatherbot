    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a soft sun, casting warm hues across the cityscape. The skies are a brilliant blue, unmarred by the fog that can so often shroud this locale in a curtain of gray. As the morning light grows stronger, the temperatures flirt with a comfortable coolness, settling just below sixty degrees. A gentle breeze stirs, whispering through the streets, its coolness a reminder of the ocean's proximity. \n\nAs the day progresses, the afternoon is expected to see a slight dip in warmth, prompting one to consider layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a long-sleeve shirt for comfort against the chilling breeze. The evening promises a peaceful retreat, with clear skies making way for starlit vistas overhead. Such conditions beckon one to stroll along the waterfront or perhaps enjoy a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s charming parks. Business as usual in this vibrant city, but today, there\u2019s a hint of leisurely exploration in the air, an invitation to discover and appreciate the beauty of a crisp San Francisco day.",
