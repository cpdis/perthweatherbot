    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a cool hush, first light beginning to rinse the roofs while the sky stays mostly clear. It won\u2019t last; light showers are due by mid-morning, trading that early crispness for a softer, damp sheen. Expect a day of shifting light rather than true sunshine, with brief bright breaks between passing clouds. The air will feel clean at first and then gently muted, visibility good though edges blurred by drizzle. Even so, once the sun slips through, the November UV will assert itself quickly, so treat any blue-sky window with the respect it deserves.\n\nDress in light layers with a compact rain shell at the ready; comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind wet pavements, sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out later. If you\u2019re up now, enjoy a short, quiet walk before the showers wander in; later, tuck into a caf\u00e9 nook, clear a few errands between bursts of rain, or visit a bookshop or the library while the weather taps at the windows.",
