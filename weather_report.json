    "weather_report": "As the clock gently ticks toward dawn in Downtown San Francisco, an air of anticipation lingers. The night is mostly cloudy, cloaked in a cool embrace with temperatures around 44, while an east-northeast breeze whisks through the streets at a steady pace. Those venturing out will likely feel the promise of rain that hangs in the air, with an anticipated 50% chance of showers after 4 a.m. The city, a shimmering tapestry of lights, seems to hold its breath, awaiting the soft patter of raindrops.\n\nThursday dawns to a definitive change, as the forecast predicts rain to envelop the city with unyielding certainty. The cloud cover will deepen, casting a cool pallor over the skyline, where the iconic Golden Gate Bridge may appear shrouded in mist. Winds will shift, sweeping in from the east-southeast, and the day will settle at about 57 degrees, finally descending to around 54 in the afternoon. The precipitation expected ranges generously, preparing for a soaking of half to three quarters of an inch. It may be wise to dress in layers\u2014think a cozy sweater under a waterproof jacket\u2014as one prepares to embrace the weather's unpredictable grace. Activities may take a more reflective turn, perhaps wandering into a welcoming caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee, or losing oneself in the quiet corners of a local bookstore, as the rain serenades the world outside.",
