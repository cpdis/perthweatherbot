    "weather_report": "As dawn splits the night in Subiaco, the stillness of the early morning is accompanied by a welcome absence of cloud cover, quite like a watercolor painting washed clear with an irresistibly serene azure. The promise of a clear sky along with the current absence of any discernible interruptions, indicates a day awash with plentiful sunshine. \n\nSartorial choices would be best inspired by the welcoming warmth of the sun, thus light clothing in breathable, natural fabrics should be ideal. A hat might not go amiss for those inclined towards daytime strolls given the expected high UV index. Sidewalk cafes might provide a soothing spot for travelers and residents alike, as the clink of cutlery and whispered conversations intertwine with the soft golden threads of the emerging day. For the more adventurous souls, they might yield to the gentle summoning of nature's trail, the sparkling day a perfect escort. Yet, for those who prefer to let the day unravel at its own pace, a quiet perch by the window with a toasty beverage might be the day's simple indulgence.",
