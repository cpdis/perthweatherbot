    "weather_report": "As the sun dips below the western horizon, leaving the town of Subiaco wrapped in the gentle embrace of twilight, the day has unfurled with serene clarity. Earlier, the skies were an unbroken expanse of azure, whispering of nothing but pure sunshine and a perfect spring day. The air, imbued with a crisp freshness that always follows a crystal-clear afternoon, holds a promise of a pleasantly mild evening ahead. With nary a cloud in sight, today has been ideal for leisurely activities beneath the wide open sky. As for what to wear, think comfort and simplicity; a lightweight jacket or a cozy sweater should suffice for the evening that lingers cool. The glow of the setting sun makes it a splendid time to walk among the rustling leaves in the nearby park or perhaps enjoy a quiet moment on a terrace, sipping on a fragrant cup of tea. Engage in conversations that wind and wander, much like the gentle evening breeze, or simply savor the symphony of silence that accompanies the fading daylight. The day, with its vibrant clarity, beckons to moments of reflection, letting every breath and pause become an event within itself, standing still in serene contemplation of all that has been, in a masterpiece painted by time.",
