    "weather_report": "Perth slides into late afternoon under a clear, polished sky. The light is honeyed and decisive, shadows lean long across verandahs, and the air feels clean. The sun still has some bite for a little while; the UV that pressed hard at midday is easing now, settling toward low as dusk gathers, but a hat and a little sunscreen are still sensible if you plan to linger outdoors.\n\nThe evening should stay cloudless and uncomplicated, a gentle fade to night with good visibility and calm moods. Dress light for now\u2014breathable fabrics\u2014and keep a soft layer handy for after sunset when the warmth ebbs. It\u2019s a day made for modest rituals: hang the last load of washing, walk to pick up a loaf and some milk, water the herbs, or take an unhurried loop around the block and let the sky darken as you go.",
