    "weather_report": "West Perth slips into night under a quilt of broken cloud, the last ember of daylight gone and the UV all but extinguished until morning. The sky is mottled and quiet, moonlight snagging on the cloud edges, streetlamps haloed and distant hills a suggestion more than a line. Expect this patchwork to linger through late evening and after midnight, a gentle, muted night rather than a crystal-clear one; pleasant enough to be outside for a spell, though the stars will play shy.\n\nIf you\u2019re stepping out, think light layers: a tee with a soft cardigan or a breezy overshirt, nothing heavy, no sunhat needed. It\u2019s a good hour for a short amble to stretch the day from your legs, a quick errand for milk, or a few minutes on the balcony with a chapter and a cup cooling in your hand. Let the windows breathe if the air feels kind, make a small plan for tomorrow, and enjoy the city humming at half-volume.",
