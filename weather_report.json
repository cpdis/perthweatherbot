    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a persistent rain gently blankets the city, whispering against rooftops and filling the air with a fresh, earthy scent. The temperature hovers in the low fifties, gradually rising to a mild embrace of fifty-five overnight. The wind sways softly from the southwest, rustling leaves and carrying with it the promise of change, while clouds loom heavily overhead, cloaking the skyline in a shroud that hints at both mystery and comfort. With a robust 90% chance of precipitation, this atmospheric symphony is not one for the faint-hearted; the drumming of raindrops is likely to accompany your evening activities.\n\nLooking to the day ahead, the sun will break through the gloom as if on cue, offering a tantalizing dawn after the night\u2019s tempest. Morning drizzle will give way to sunny skies, bathing the streets in a golden light by noon, although temperatures will hover around sixty-three, sliding down to sixty-one by the afternoon. Opt for layers\u2014a lightweight jacket and perhaps a cozy sweater will balance the crisp morning air with the warmth of midday. This kind of transitional weather invites you to explore the quieter corners of the city; perhaps take a stroll through a local park, wander into a cozy caf\u00e9, or lose yourself in the aisles of a beloved independent bookstore, savoring the remnants of rain as you sip a hot beverage. The city is yours to discover, uniquely alive in its weathered charm.",
