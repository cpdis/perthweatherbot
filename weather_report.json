    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives with a lucid, uncomplicated sky; sunlight pours in without fuss, edges crisp, shadows honest. Forecasts keep the day on this bright track through the afternoon into early evening, so expect a steady run of blue and little in the way of cloud or distraction. The UV will peak through the early afternoon under this clean sun, so lean on a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a swipe of sunscreen; light, breathable layers will feel right, with a spare layer handy if a breeze picks up later. It\u2019s the sort of pleasant day made for ordinary rituals: a quiet walk to fetch lunch, errands done on foot, a line of laundry left to drink the light, or a short turn in the garden; as the sun lowers, the brightness will soften to a kinder glow, inviting an unhurried stroll before supper.",
