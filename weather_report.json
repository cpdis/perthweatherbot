    "weather_report": "Late morning in Porongurup arrives with a kind, silvery light, the sun slipping between patches of cloud and laying soft shadows over the granite and marri. Expect a mostly bright early afternoon with generous sunny breaks, then a slow drift toward thicker cloud by late day. The air should feel easy-going rather than heavy, the view clear, the colors a touch muted as the afternoon wears on. Even with the cloud, the UV around midday is punchy; the sort that catches you unprepared.\n\nDress in light layers and a breathable shirt, add a brimmed hat and sunscreen, and keep a light sweater handy for when the sun ducks behind a slab of cloud. It\u2019s a good day for unrushed things: lunch on the veranda, a short amble along a familiar track, a bit of pruning or potting, hanging a wash to dry before the clouds knit together, or a quiet loop to town for odds and ends. As evening edges in, the light will soften and the day will wind down gently rather than grandly.",
