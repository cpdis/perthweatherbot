    "weather_report": "Before sunrise in Bend, the sky is clear and the air holds its mountain bite; streets are quiet, frost clings to windshields, and the eastern horizon is already thinking about color. Forecasts keep the morning cloudless from after dawn through late morning, so expect a bright, transparent day with sun that feels gentle at first and a little more insistent by midday. UV is low at daybreak, edging toward moderate late morning if the blue holds, so sunglasses are wise and a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t be wasted. It will feel pleasant in the light but still winter-cool in the shade; dress in warm layers with a coat, beanie, and gloves, shedding a layer once the sun has some say. Good hours for letting light pour through the kitchen, a short dog walk, clearing the car and running a small errand after nine, or sitting by a bright window with a list and a pen while Bend wakes to a clear, honest sky.",
