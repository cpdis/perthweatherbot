    "weather_report": "As night drapes itself gently over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and clear, with a refreshing chill settling in. The temperature hovers around a cool 41 degrees, inviting a slight layer for warmth. With a whisper of a north-northeast wind, it's a good time to relish the stillness of the city, undisturbed by the usual bustle. The skies are predominantly clear, offering a canvas unhindered by fog\u2014perhaps a fleeting sigh of relief from the often-surrounding marine layer. \n\nLooking ahead to Monday, expect the sun to rise brightly, where the day's warmth will gradually creep to a high near 54. As the afternoon draws near, temperatures will slip back into the low 50s, making layers essential for comfort. The gentle southeast winds promise a serene day, perfect for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quieter exploration of the city's hidden gems. A light jacket will serve well against the cool breeze, while the urban landscape calls to those looking to embrace the day with a stroll or quiet coffee in the nearby parks, enjoying the vibrancy of life that\u2019s just beginning to stir.",
