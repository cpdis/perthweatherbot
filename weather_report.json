    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a brisk serenity envelops the city, with temperatures dipping to a cool 49. The north-northeast winds hum through the streets at a steady pace, occasionally whipping up to a lively 29 mph, sending a refreshing shiver across the landscape. The night sky remains clear, offering a rare moment of transparency, where one can gaze toward the celestial tapestry above and anticipate the promise of a sunlit day ahead.\n\nTomorrow heralds a sunny Sunday, blanketing the city in warmth with highs flirting around 60 degrees. As the afternoon unfolds, expect a gradual retreat of warmth, settling around 56. For those braving the chill of the evening air, layers will be key; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the cool breeze and late-night nip. With weather this agreeable, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the waves kiss the shore, or perhaps find a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warming cup of coffee while watching the world drift by. It\u2019s a day for quiet contemplation, fresh air, and the gentle hum of the city waking into the light.",
