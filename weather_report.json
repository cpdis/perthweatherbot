    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle haze lingers in the air, wrapping the city in a soft embrace of marine fog, particularly hugging the shoreline and particularly pronounced around the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, which shrouds its majestic arches in a cloak of mystery. The forecast suggests a persistent cloudiness with temperatures hovering in the low fifties throughout the day. This subdued light renders the skyline an ethereal silhouette against the soft pastel hues of early morning.\n\nWith the sun making a timid attempt to pierce through, the day ahead promises to transition into sporadic moments of sunshine, punctuating the clouds and offering a hint of warmth to the cool breeze blowing in from the north-northwest. Dressing in layers would be prudent; a lightweight jacket over a comfy sweater will keep you comfortable as the day progresses from the crispness of the morning to the slightly more inviting afternoon. Perhaps a stroll through the quieter streets of the city, a visit to a hidden caf\u00e9, or simply enjoying the muted beauty of the day while sipping a warm beverage sounds appealing, inviting you to indulge in the calm before the city's bustle takes hold once more.",
