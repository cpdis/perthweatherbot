    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco arrives bright and easy, the sky mostly open with a few stray clouds drifting like slow boats. By late morning the sun will take charge, then a touch more cloud slides in during the afternoon, but not enough to dull the day\u2019s shine. Air feels clean and sightlines long; colors look newly painted. Expect a strongly sunny stretch around midday when the UV bites hardest for this time of year, the kind that turns a short walk into a reminder to respect the light.\n\nDress for lightness: breathable fabrics, short sleeves if you like, and a hat you won\u2019t mind wearing for hours. Sunscreen is not optional today, and sunglasses will make the world more comfortable. It\u2019s a good morning to fetch a coffee and sit beneath an awning, to run errands on foot before the pavements warm, to hang a wash that will dry in no time, or to read a chapter on a shaded bench and let the day idle past.",
