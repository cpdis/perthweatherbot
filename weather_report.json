    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Katy, the sky is swept clean and quiet, a dark enamel with a few sharp stars. The night feels gentle and settled, the kind that slows the breath and softens the neighborhood edges; with the sun long gone, the UV burden is essentially nil and visibility is crisp.\n\nEarlier, midday and late afternoon ran under an unbroken blue\u2014bright, uncomplicated sun and a cheerful clarity that likely carried a stout UV bite at its peak. If that clear pattern lingers into morning, plan light layers you can add or shed and keep sunglasses handy toward midday; for now, a light sweater or jacket suits the cool calm. It\u2019s a good hour for a slow circuit around the block or a last, easy check on porch plants; after dawn, consider coffee on the stoop, a quiet dog walk before traffic stirs, a quick grocery run while aisles are empty, or wiping down the car windows as the day brightens.",
