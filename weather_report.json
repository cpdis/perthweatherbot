    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a clear, rinsed-blue sky and the last warmth of the day loosening its grip. It has been a sun-splashed afternoon under a spotless dome, the kind that makes colors pop and shadows crisp; UV earlier was fierce, but now slips to gentle as the light thins. The air feels open and uncomplicated, the kind of clarity that carries birdsong and the clink of garden gates, and promises a clean, starry night.\n\nExpect the sky to stay cloudless into late evening, more velvet than flame as it goes. Dress light and breathable, adding a soft layer once the breeze turns inquisitive; if you were out earlier, sunscreen and a brim would have been wise, but for now comfort rules. It\u2019s a pleasant time for small things done unhurriedly: a quiet loop around the block, watering the herbs, airing the laundry, or reading on the porch while dinner finishes itself. With the UV now low and the night inviting, you might linger outdoors a little longer than planned, letting the day fold away without drama.",
