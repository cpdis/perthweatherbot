    "weather_report": "Evening settles softly over Subiaco under a clear, unblemished sky. The day was sun-washed and decisive, and now the light is slipping away cleanly; with the sun gone, the UV has lost its sting and the air feels open and crisp. Visibility is excellent, the kind of clarity that sharpens edges and quiets the streets, with stars ready to take their places.\n\nExpect the night to remain serene and cloudless, pleasant for wandering without hurry. Short sleeves will suit an early stroll; bring a light layer if you linger. It\u2019s a good time to step out for a small errand, water the garden while the heat has eased, or open the windows and let the house breathe. A bench, a book, and the slow fade of twilight would not go to waste.",
