The temperatures hover in the cool embrace of the mid-forties, edging toward the low fifties as the night gradually surrenders to morning. A soft south wind adds a gentle shiver to the atmosphere, while the prospect of drizzle lingers throughout the day. The streets will glisten with the possibility of light rainfall, inviting the curious to experience the nuanced beauty of a day swept in gray.\n\nWith a high near sixty-two, the city will quietly transition into a cooler afternoon, where the sun's warmth struggles to penetrate the thick canopy of clouds. One might expect a sense of dampness clinging to the air, a hallmark of the marine layer that often blankets the city, particularly near the Bay. Mists may weave themselves through the iconic landscape, offering a moody backdrop against the bustling life below. To navigate this day comfortably, consider layers\u2014a light sweater beneath a waterproof jacket to guard against any uninvited drizzle. As you roam, perhaps take a leisurely stroll through one of the peaceful parks where the foliage's vibrant greens might emerge from their drenched slumber or find refuge in a cozy cafe, indulging in the warmth of a freshly brewed coffee, while the city hums in its sleepy, rainy rhythm.",
