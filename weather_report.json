    "weather_report": "As the early morning wraps Downtown San Francisco in its soft embrace, the atmosphere is painted with a tapestry of mostly cloudy skies. A gentle chill hangs in the air with temperatures nudging toward the low fifties, hinting at the day's gradual ascent. Watching over the city from heights, you might discern the subtle dance of low-hanging clouds, possibly teasing the shores with a fleeting marine layer while allowing brief glimpses of blue sky.\n\nLooking ahead, Sunday promises a transformation. The clouds will surrender to the sun, granting a delightful warmth that invites the urban dwellers to emerge and explore. While temperatures will rise to the lower sixties, a slight afternoon descent will remind you of the cool coastal influence. Donning layers is advisable; a light jacket can shield against the morning coolness and the afternoon breeze may warrant a cozy scarf. The day unfurls an invitation for a leisurely stroll, perhaps along the Embarcadero, where the fresh sea air mingles with the laughter of passersby, or a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9, offering the perfect spot to savor the transforming light.",
