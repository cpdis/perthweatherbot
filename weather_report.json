    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco feels clear and golden, the sun still assertive enough to nip at bare skin while visibility stretches cleanly to the edges. Expect bright, open sky as day leans toward evening, then a light, polite shower to settle in after sundown, turning the light pewter and the pavement glossy. It\u2019s comfortably warm and inviting now, but the UV remains spirited; a hat, sunglasses, and a brush of sunscreen are wise for the next hour, with a compact umbrella or light shell handy for later. A gentle walk to the grocer, a slow lap of the park, or a coffee at a sidewalk table suits the mood; afterward, let the sprinkle keep you company over a simple supper or a chapter by the window. Dress in breathable layers and easy shoes, and be ready to swap the shades for a hood once the first drops arrive.",
