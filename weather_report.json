    "weather_report": "This afternoon unfolds beautifully across Downtown San Francisco, where the sun graces the city with warmth and brightness. The air carries a refreshing breeze, a gentle reminder of the ocean's presence, as the temperatures settle around a pleasant 68 degrees before easing down to 64 later in the day. The sky is a clear canvas, absent of the notorious fog that often cloaks the area, allowing for unobstructed views of iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and the swirling waters of the bay.\n\nAs evening approaches, the forecast promises a continue of clarity, though the temperature will drop to a cozy 52 degrees. With a westward wind whispering through the city streets, it may be wise to layer your outfit; a light jacket or sweater will provide comfort against the mild chill. These conditions invite a stroll along the waterfront or an exploration of the bustling neighborhoods, where the lingering daylight mingles with the scents and sounds of city life. Whether sipping a warm drink at a caf\u00e9 terrace or wandering through a park to catch the last rays of the sun, San Francisco offers a lovely afternoon and evening promising both tranquility and vibrancy.",
