    "weather_report": "Before sunrise in Subiaco, the air feels hushed and clean, the sky a deep ink slowly rinsing toward blue. It is clear now and will be clear at first light, the kind of morning where edges look crisp and the world seems newly washed. Expect the sun to take charge quickly after dawn; brightness will sharpen, the UV will ramp up fast, and by late morning the light will feel blunt and insistent. The day promises clarity rather than drama: dry, cloudless, and easy to read at a glance.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant one if you time it right. Start with a light layer over breathable clothes, then pare back as the sun gathers strength; sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and sunscreen will earn their keep by midmorning. A quiet walk to catch the day unfurling, watering pots before the heat builds, or a ride for a simple breakfast run would suit the early hours. Later, shade-friendly errands, a book on a veranda, or hanging laundry to the honest sun all make sense. The sky will do its part; you just have to step into it.",
