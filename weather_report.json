    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a soft, damp hush. The sun is long gone and with it any bite of UV; brightness gives way to a low, pewter glow as light showers drift in late tonight, leaving the streets glazed and the air a little hushed around the edges. Expect the rain to ease toward the small hours into scattered cloud, the sky loosening here and there so a few ragged stars might blink through. Clarity is subdued rather than murky, more watercolor than charcoal, the kind of night where sound carries and colors deepen.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant enough night if you dress for it: a light waterproof, closed shoes, and a small umbrella tucked under your arm. This is weather for a quiet errand, a gentle loop around the block between showers, or a slow hour at home tending to overlooked things\u2014sorting a drawer, steeping tea, queuing up that album you meant to hear end to end. If you\u2019re out late, plan on slick pavements and a gentle cool that asks for sleeves, not armor.",
