    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a shroud of gray clouds, the kind that promise rain while enveloping the city in a damp embrace. The temperature hovers around a cool 56 degrees, and a gentle northeast wind whispers at about 10 mph, stirring the leaves without disrupting the stillness that a rainy day brings. As the forecast suggests, rain is likely, with a 70% chance of precipitation, setting the tone for a moody environment accented by the soft patter of droplets to come. \n\nIn these conditions, the subtle elegance of the city\u2019s architectural lines is softened, as if a painter chose a heavier brushstroke for the scene. Fog mingles with the possibility of a light drizzle, blurring the distant outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and lending a dreamy quality to the views that echo the less frenetic pace of a Sunday. As the skies darken towards evening, a cozy indoor ambiance becomes inviting, leading one to consider quiet pleasures\u2014a visit to a local caf\u00e9 with a warm drink or indulging in a novel that has gathered dust on the shelf. Dress for today leans towards comfort, with layers\u2014a light waterproof jacket or a sturdy umbrella could be essential as the evening cools and brings the chance of rain to 50%. Choose warmth and a hint of the practical to traverse this lovely, if somewhat introspective, San Francisco day.",
