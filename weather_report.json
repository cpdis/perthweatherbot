    "weather_report": "As daylight awakens Downtown San Francisco, a muted brightness filters through the thick canopy of clouds, casting a soft, silvery hue over the city. The air feels cool yet inviting, with temperatures tending toward the mid-fifties. While the forecast hints at modest sunshine for the day, the skies might remain partly veiled, allowing only occasional glimpses of peeking sunbeams. The tranquil southwest winds rustle gently, creating a pleasant backdrop against the city's rhythmic pulse. \n\nYet, as night approaches, a different mood will descend. The promise of rain unfurls\u2014a soft mist likely to arrive after 10 PM, cloaking the city in a hush while raising temperatures subtly, fostering a sense of intimacy and warmth. For the afternoon, light layers are advisable; a light jacket or cardigan will keep the crispness at bay while you navigate through the city. There\u2019s always time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, soaking in the vibrant life around you as the city prepares for its evening transformation.",
