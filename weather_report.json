    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a veil of grayish clouds hangs delicately above, casting a muted tone over the morning. The air is cool, with temperatures hovering around 56 degrees, and a gentle breeze from the west adds a crispness that beckons you to bundle up in a light jacket. As the day unfolds, these clouds promise a transformation, with the prospect of light rain later in the evening. The persistent marine layer lingers, subtle and unassuming, reducing visibility but creating a moody ambiance that envelops the city.\n\nOutdoor plans might benefit from a measured approach today. A leisurely stroll through the quieter streets or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 might be just right. As the afternoon unfolds, the chance of rain increases, hinting at a cozy evening indoors, perhaps with a good book or a comforting cup of tea. Dress in layers to adapt to the shifting temperatures, and embrace the gentle melancholy of a San Francisco winter's day, where the city feels alive in its own, understated way.",
