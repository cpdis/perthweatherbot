    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes midnight over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds lingers overhead, casting a gentle gloom that embraces the city. The chill in the air whispers of the overnight low that will settle around 45 degrees, a reminder to those venturing out that warmth is a cherished companion. The soft north-northeast wind, barely more than a whisper at 7 mph, rustles the leaves but does little to shake the stillness of the night.\n\nWith the dawn, whispers of sunshine will begin to dance across the skyline, lifting the spirits of the city as it transitions into a mostly sunny day. The high temperature will hover near 60, only to cradle down to the mid-50s as the afternoon approaches, inviting layers that combine the comfort of warmth with the crispness of cool air. It promises a day free from heavy fog, with the usual marine layer at bay, allowing the iconic silhouettes of the Golden Gate and the Financial District to emerge unshrouded. This weather paints a canvas ripe for quiet strolls through the streets, perhaps a leisurely afternoon spent in a local caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm drink while watching life unfold just outside the window. Dress comfortably, embracing the cool with cozy sweaters or light jackets, and step out to revel in a day that speaks of the gentleness of late autumn in San Francisco.",
