    "weather_report": "Subiaco slides into late morning under a clean, hard blue, the kind of sky that leaves no fingerprints. The forecast keeps it clear through midday and early afternoon, so expect bright, uncomplicated sunshine and crisp visibility that etches every edge. UV will climb to very high levels around noon, so think wide-brim hat, sunglasses, and a firm coat of sunscreen even for short walks. Light, breathable layers will feel right; a long-sleeve linen or cotton shirt earns its keep if you plan to linger outdoors. It\u2019s a pleasant day with a confident glare rather than heat-drama, inviting small, useful errands done early, a coffee in the shade of a courtyard, a quick loop on foot to stretch the legs, laundry on the line, a little quiet reading indoors while the sun does its stern work, then another step outside as the afternoon softens.",
