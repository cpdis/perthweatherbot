    "weather_report": "Calmly the stratus shifts overhead, marking an evening in Subiaco under the canopy of broken clouds. The expanse above eloquently mirrors the tranquility below, diminished by the retreat of the day's sun. As daylight gracefully surrenders to twilight, Subiaco finds itself lost in comfortable obscurity, an undisturbed quietude our city is privy to. Any desire for the freedom of sunlight is pacified by the soft lullaby crooned by the monotonous orchestra of the breeze, gently swaying leafless branches and tugging our coats closer to our bodies. Indeed, the quiet of evening necessitates a warmth that is any battle-weathered coat's rite of passage. Just right for a walk down quiet lanes.\n\nOur dormant city lays waiting in anticipation for the promise of tomorrow. The coming hours hold within them the beauty of transient diffidence, a spectacle of the ephemeral that only a period of broken clouds can confer. There is something fulfilling about walking under such a spectacle, an antidote to the monotony the sun often weaves into our lives. Don't be surprised if you find your hands unconsciously seeking the comforting warmth of pockets or long-forgotten scarfs wrapped a little tighter as the evening chill makes its subtle presence known. Perfect, isn't it? A stroll that submerges you in the tranquility of the evening, the murmur of distant life the only company you need. Perhaps after, a hot mug of something sweet might be in order to thaw the chill from your bones.",
