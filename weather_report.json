    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips past midnight under a ceiling of broken cloud, the streets still a little glossy from earlier light rain. The night feels rinsed and quiet, with only a faint glow where the clouds thin. Sunshine will be limited when morning stirs\u2014more filtered silver than bright gold\u2014so the UV index is nil now and likely modest after sunrise, softened by the cloud. Visibility is decent, edges slightly softened by lingering damp. It looks like a mostly gentle day rather than a sparkling one: serviceable, calm, the kind that invites unhurried plans.\n\nDress in light layers with a small umbrella in your bag, closed shoes for the damp, and sunglasses for those moments when the sun finds the gaps. If you\u2019re up early, a slow walk to a caf\u00e9 suits the mood; later, tidy the garden after the drizzle, browse the library stacks, or run a few errands while the sky plays at being undecided. It\u2019s weather for steady rhythms rather than grand gestures.",
