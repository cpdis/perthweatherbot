    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this damp San Francisco morning, the city is enveloped in a blanket of rain, the streets glistening with reflections of distant lights fighting against the shadows of clouds. The soft patter of droplets against rooftops offers a rhythmic backdrop, while the towering skyline fades into the mist, lending an ethereal quality to the familiar sights. Visibility is diminished, with the iconic Golden Gate Bridge obscured, perhaps softened by the tendrils of fog that sweep in from the bay. \n\nAs the day progresses, the forecast calls for continued rain, keeping the atmosphere cool and the air rich with the scent of wet earth. One might consider layering up in a light, water-repellent jacket, complemented by comfortable boots\u2014perfect for splashing through puddles or enjoying the cozy indoors. The chill will persist, inviting a leisurely assembly of warm beverages, perhaps at a caf\u00e9 with large windows that allow one to observe the city while remaining snug within. It is not a day for grand excursions, but rather for quiet moments, tucked away from the rain, perhaps losing oneself in a book or savoring a well-crafted pastry as the world outside embraces the beauty of a rainy day.",
