The afternoon held its nerve without a cloud, and that polished clarity now carries into the late hours; streetlamps seem crisper, and a few steady stars keep their posts. The sun has bowed out and with it the UV\u2014nothing to fret over now\u2014though the ongoing clarity hints that when daylight returns, it will arrive bright and unfiltered.\n\nExpect the night to stay calm and dry. It\u2019s a light-layer sort of evening: a soft shirt and a cardigan or a breathable jacket if you mean to linger outside. Good hours for a gentle loop of the neighborhood, watering the balcony plants, finishing a small errand without the daytime bustle, or sitting by an open window with a book while the quiet slips through.",
