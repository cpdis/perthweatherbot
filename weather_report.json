    "weather_report": "The afternoon breathes a gentle coolness over Downtown San Francisco, where the remnants of haze give way to a bright and sunny disposition. Temperatures are gracefully winding down from a high of just over sixty, soon dropping to a brisk fifty-six as the day softens. The view is punctuated by clarity, with sweeping vistas revealing the shimmer of the bay and the silhouettes of the iconic skyline. The promise of warmth lingers in the air, yet the touch of a west wind reminds us of the city's coastal essence, barely rustling at six mph.\n\nAs night drapes its velvety cloak, skies will remain mostly clear, leading into a cool evening with lows nestling around forty-six. A wisp of a southeast breeze might offer a whisper, but for now, the day invites outdoor strolls, perhaps through the streets alive with the hum of late afternoon activities. One might consider donning a light jacket\u2014a cozy layer fit for the fickle San Francisco evening chill\u2014while embarking on a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps settling in for a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9, indulging in the city's mellowness as night falls softly over the bay.",
