    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds beneath an expansive sky, mostly sunny, illuminated by a gentle sun seeking to warm a crisp air that barely nudges past the mid-fifties. As the clock ticks towards the early afternoon, temperatures dip slightly, bestowing upon the city an air of coolness that encourages layered attire. A light northwestern breeze stirs, whispering through the streets, adding a comforting rustle to the otherwise serene ambiance. \n\nThe clarity of the day is striking; there is no fog to mar the view, providing a clear window to the iconic skyline and the distant Golden Gate, crisp against the azure expanse. This picture-perfect day beckons for a leisurely stroll through the Marina or a peaceful moment in one of the nearby parks. It is a day best felt with a light jacket, perhaps crafted from a breathable fabric that allows for movement while warding off the cool bite of winter's breath. As night draws closer, expect the clouds to blanket the sky partially; a cozy evening in a local caf\u00e9, perhaps sipping on a warm beverage, seems the ideal way to wrap up this lovely day.",
