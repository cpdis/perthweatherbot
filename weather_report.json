    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the city prepares for a symphony of rain, painting the streets with a reflective sheen. The sky hangs heavy, cloaked in clouds that promise an unyielding downpour, while a brisk south southeast wind whistles through the alleys at speeds that lend a chill to the air. The forecast speaks of a relentless 100% chance of rain tonight, with the drops weaving a narrative of cozy indoor comforts, perfect for unwinding with a good book or savoring the warmth of a well-brewed cup. \n\nTomorrow, the rain will persist in a softer cadence, tapering off into a mist-laden afternoon. With temperatures dipping slightly, it beckons a thoughtful wardrobe choice\u2014perhaps a stylish raincoat paired with sturdy boots to tread the puddled sidewalks. The marine layer lingers on the fringes, swirling in the background but not entirely obscuring the skyline. It might not be the day for excursions into the hills, but a trip to your favorite caf\u00e9, where the aroma of roasting beans drifts through the air, seems fitting. Let the rain be a backdrop to your mellow adventures, as you navigate the vibrant, albeit damp, heart of the city.",
