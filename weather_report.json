    "weather_report": "As the evening drapes a calm cloak over Downtown San Francisco, the air is refreshingly crisp, with temperatures settling around the mid-forties. Tonight is illuminated by a clear sky, creating an inviting atmosphere for those who enjoy stargazing or long, leisurely strolls along the waterfront, where the gentle whisper of the breeze carries a hint of the ocean\u2019s brine. The South Southwest wind, barely a whisper at 3 mph, adds to the tranquility, making it a perfect evening for quiet reflection or cozy gatherings.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Tuesday, expect the sunshine to unfurl its warm embrace, reaching a peak near the fifties. The forecast suggests a subtle descent into a more subdued coolness by afternoon, with lush blue skies promising a day that's both serene and revitalizing. The absence of fog lends clarity to the landscape, making it ideal for a morning jaunt through Golden Gate Park or a moment spent sipping coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, as the city awakens around you. Dressing in layers will ensure comfort; a light jacket over a soft sweater should suffice against the gentle chill, and a pair of comfortable shoes can invite exploration on this brisk day when the city shines like a jewel in the winter's light.",
