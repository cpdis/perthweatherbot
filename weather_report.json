    "weather_report": "North Perth settles into late afternoon under a dimming, lid-like sky. The air feels a touch heavy, the light already thinning; any sunshine that slips through will be fleeting before a spell of light rain moves in around the evening commute, then eases to a solid blanket of overcast into night. UV is low from here on, and the day has that soft, muffled clarity where edges are crisp but colors are subdued.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for comfort: a light waterproof jacket, closed shoes you don\u2019t mind meeting damp footpaths, and an umbrella more for company than a downpour. Sunglasses can stay home. This weather leans toward the quietly pleasant if you let it\u2014wrap up an errand, browse a bookshop until the rain patters, or head home to put a simple sauce on the stove and tidy the week\u2019s papers. If you\u2019re out, a warm drink at a corner caf\u00e9 while the first drops stipple the pavement will suit the mood; if you\u2019re in, open a window to the cool and let the evening collect itself.",
