    "weather_report": "As evening gracefully descends upon the charming enclave of Subiaco, the echoes of afternoon raindrops have been whisked away by the bracing dip of the sun beneath the horizon. Leaving behind a tapestry of broken clouds that canvas the sky, revealing pockets where the fading light of day still peeks through. The sun has already retreated, allowing the cooling air to embrace the streets and lanes, casting a calming spell over the day. The gentle moisture left behind by earlier showers gives the surfaces a subtle sheen, whispering of the rain that has now wandered into memory. \n\nWith daylight yielding to dusk, the clarity of the day fades, lending the atmosphere a delicate softness as the world prepares for night. Pleasant and balmy conditions with a light jacket are all one needs to savor what remains of this Sunday evening. Wander leisurely under the cloud-kissed sky; perhaps a stroll through Subiaco's peaceful lanes, or settle in at a cozy caf\u00e9 terrace, enjoying the allure of the fading twilight. As the raindrops have subdued, there\u2019s an invitation in the air to reflect on the tranquility that follows the storm, to find solace beneath the canopy of moving clouds. It's a time to unwind, light the candle of contemplation, and breathe in the fresh scent of earth stirred by the rain, as you wrap yourself in the soft, shadowy embrace of a summer evening in Subiaco.",
