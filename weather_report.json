As the nocturnal hours retreat, the air is imbued with a mild chill, settling around 48 degrees, making the quiet streets whisper with a gentle breeze from the north northeast. It\u2019s a night where the city feels cradled in a comfortable embrace, the kind that invites you to wrap yourself in a light layer, a soft shawl against the coolness before the sun breaks through.\n\nThursday's embrace shall be mostly sunny, painting the day in hues of warmth where temperatures will creep up to the low 60s before surrendering to a gentle decline in the afternoon. The clarity of the sky hints at a stark contrast to what often cloaks the city\u2014the marine layer that dances along the edges of the landscape, though tonight, it appears to be held at bay. Expect a day where the charm of sunshine wraps around you, perfect for a quiet walk in the park, perhaps a leisurely exploration of local art galleries, or a cozy caf\u00e9 stop where the rich aroma of coffee mingles with the sound of soft conversation. Dress in layers, as the sun's warmth may not fully pierce through until later in the day, and let the simple pleasure of being outdoors guide your afternoon.",
