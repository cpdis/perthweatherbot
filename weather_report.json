    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a whisper of cloud lingers in the night sky, gradually yielding to the promise of a sunlit day. The air is crisp, carrying a faint chill reminiscent of the sea breeze that often dances through these streets. With temperatures poised to reach around 60, it\u2019s a gentle reminder that while the cold may still nip, the golden warmth of the sun is not far behind. A light northeast wind stirs at a modest pace, invigorating yet not overpowering, allowing that lingering chill to dissipate gradually as the day progresses.\n\nThere is an unmistakable clarity painting the horizon, hinting that fog, a frequent ghost that haunts this city, is nowhere in sight. Instead, the sun will undoubtedly unveil its brilliance, leading to a splendid afternoon where even the most stoic of buildings seem to bask in the light. As the sun climbs higher, the temperatures will settle invitingly, making it an opportune time for a stroll through the city\u2019s winding paths or along the waterfront. For those venturing out, layering is wise\u2014a simple jacket or sweater in case the breeze picks up, a nod to the coolness of the early morning. Meanwhile, the canvas of this day calls for a leisurely exploration: a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, a walk through the vibrant streets, or a moment spent in one of the city\u2019s many parks, where the gentle sun can be fully appreciated.",
