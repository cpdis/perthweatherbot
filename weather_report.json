    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a glass-blue sky this afternoon, the sun clean and unwavering, shadows crisp as paper cutouts. The air feels dry and transparent, a day of high clarity where distant lines sharpen and colours lift. Sunshine will hold through the later hours with little to trouble it; UV is fierce around lunchtime and stays punchy into mid-afternoon before easing, so treat the light with respect.\n\nDress for easy movement and shade: a breathable shirt, hat with a brim, sunglasses, and a whisper of broad-spectrum sunscreen. Keep water nearby. Save longer rambles for the gentler light later on; until then, choose simple comforts. Hang the washing and let it drink the breeze. Slip into a gallery or the library and step back out when the sun softens, then wander the river path or a quiet street to admire whatever is in bloom. If you must be out now, keep to the lee of buildings and trees, moving from shadow to shadow like a cat who knows the neighborhood.",
