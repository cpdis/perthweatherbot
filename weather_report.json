    "weather_report": "As the sun quietly descends below the horizon, the warmth it bequeathed to Subiaco lingers in the air. Just over an hour past twilight, the town is bathed in soft, gentle hues as the sky transitions from the brilliant hues of sunset to serene starlit darkness. Earlier today, the sky was a perfect canvas of clear blue, promising a day devoid of clouds, dominated instead by the sun's golden reign. The UV index likely soared at midday, urging those out and about to seek shade or bear the protection of hats and sunscreen. It's an evening that lends itself to bare arms and airy fabrics as the cooling temperatures nudge summer heat towards a comfortable balmy balance. With night firmly settling in, thoughts of activity gently pivot from the outdoor hustle to the indoor hum of sociable gatherings or the allure of a cozy read by a softly glowing lamp. Tonight offers an invitation to stroll in the inky night, perhaps indulging in a languorous walk as crickets serenade the silence. There's a charming stillness that envelops the town, inviting one to savor both the lingering warmth of the day and the embracing coolness of the approaching night.",
