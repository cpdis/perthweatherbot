    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a brightening morning, the light already clean and unhurried, with only a scatter of high cloud softening the edges. Warmth is gathering and the sun feels intent; expect the UV to climb quickly and bite around midday. Visibility should be crisp, colors sharper than usual, the sort of clarity that makes even brick and jacaranda bark look newly varnished.\n\nBy late morning a few fair-weather clouds drift about, then the afternoon clears to an open blue, unabashedly sunny. It will feel pleasant if you keep to shade and breeze, less so under the full glare. Dress light and breathable, brimmed hat and sunglasses, sunscreen without skimping. Good day for small, ordinary missions: a walk to the bakery before lunch, watering the garden while shadows are still long, a short ride to the shops, or a book at a caf\u00e9 table under an awning. Through the peak sun, let indoor tasks take their turn, then step back out when the light mellows.",
