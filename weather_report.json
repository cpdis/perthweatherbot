    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of an early morning hour here in Subiaco, the weather seems to awaken with a touch of hesitation. The night has recently bid adieu to the light rain, leaving behind a landscape kissed by delicate droplets, whispering to the gardens and pavements alike. As the clock ticks past two into the stillness, the heavens have draped themselves in a veil of broken clouds, offering a sky that suggests a muted palette rather than the vibrant hues of dawn. It's a day that promises more silver shades than golden rays, urging light jackets and soft fabrics that acknowledge the slight chill in the air. The UV index hints at remaining subdued, inviting a more gentle armor than sunscreen and sunglasses. \n\nToday unfolds as an opportunity to relish in indoor retreats or quieter outdoor reflections. The subdued light, softened by the broken clouds, creates an atmosphere ideal for catching up on stories or art, perhaps finding solace in the pages of a beloved book or leisurely sketching at a caf\u00e9 nook. Gentle walks might suit the mood too, as the clouds offer a cover that seems to cradle rather than exuberate. The day suggests mindfulness and coziness, an invitation to unwind from the rush and merely be, finding comfort in sipping a warm brew or strolling through the familiar rituals of an unhurried routine.",
