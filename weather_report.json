    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a honeyed evening under a spotless sky, the sun tipping toward the rooftops and taking the sting out of the day. Visibility is clean and crisp, colors a touch richer in the late light, with the air feeling dry and well-behaved. It has been a decidedly sunny day, the kind that pushes shadows into sharp relief and drives the UV index high at midday; now, as the angle softens, UV falls to gentle levels and the heat ebbs without drama.\n\nExpect the night to stay clear and calm, with a sense of ease made for simple pleasures rather than spectacle. Light, breathable clothes suit the moment; if you were out earlier, a hat and sunscreen were your closest friends, but this hour asks only for comfortable layers and maybe a dab of repellent for inquisitive mozzies. A quiet stroll to pick up something for dinner, watering the garden while the sky turns amber, or sitting on the veranda with a book and the first stars arriving would all fit the weather\u2019s unhurried mood.",
