    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a rinsed-blue morning, the sort of clean, shadow-etched light that promises a day without a wrinkle of cloud. As the sun climbs toward late morning and early afternoon, expect the brightness to turn unapologetically direct; UV will ramp up quickly under the clear sky, and the air will feel warm, perhaps hot, as the hours stretch on. Visibility looks razor clear, colors vivid, edges sharp, the kind of day that makes everything appear freshly painted.\n\nWear light, breathable layers with a broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses, and don strong sunscreen; a water bottle won\u2019t go astray. A mid-morning coffee in a shaded courtyard suits the moment, or a short errand on foot before the sun asserts itself. Washing will dry in a blink, and a quick tidy of the garden is best done now, saving the longer outdoor tasks for later when the light softens. If the glare becomes too insistent, step into a quiet bookshop or gallery, then reemerge toward late afternoon for an easy amble through tree-lined streets.",
