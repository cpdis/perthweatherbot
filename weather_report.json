    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun casts a warm glow over the city, illuminating the iconic skyline under a nearly cloudless expanse of blue. With a high approaching a comfortable 68 degrees, the early hours have already begun to shed the coolness, settling into a mild warmth. The gentle northwesterly breeze brushes against the skin, weaving through the streets as people venture out to enjoy the day. The clarity of the atmosphere seems to extend an invitation to step outside \u2014 whether to stroll along the Embarcadero, with its breathtaking view of the Bay, or to lose oneself in the vibrant art galleries nestled in the fog-free corners of the Mission.\n\nAs the evening settles in, expect a serene calmness with temperatures dipping gently to around 50 degrees, allowing for a cozy wrap of a light jacket or sweater. The absence of fog today renders the usual ghostly silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and surrounding hills distinctly visible, offering a picturesque backdrop for an afternoon at a caf\u00e9 or a leisurely exploration of the local bookshops. The overall ambiance is pleasant \u2014 a perfect day to embrace simplicity, to wander through sun-dappled streets, or perhaps indulge in a leisurely outdoor meal, savoring the flavors of the season.",
