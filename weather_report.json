    "weather_report": "As the sun dips behind the horizon, Downtown San Francisco settles into a chilly embrace. The afternoon has brought a stubborn shroud of clouds, cloaking the city in muted greys that usher in the evening's promise of rain. A soft breeze whispers through the streets, hinting at the transformation ahead as temperatures meander downwards, dipping to a low of around 52 degrees. The southern wind, pulsating at about ten to eighteen miles per hour, stirs a sense of anticipation for the impending downpour.\n\nTonight, the forecast confirms what many can already sense: rain after 10 PM, likely accompanied by the thickening marine layer that often rolls in from the bay, obscuring familiar landmarks under its wet veil. Visibility is waning, and with a 90% chance of precipitation, one can only wonder about the rhythm of raindrops against rooftops. Dressing in layers becomes a wise choice; a warm jacket, perhaps one that is waterproof, will guard against the chill and dampness, while sturdy shoes will keep the feet dry for any evening stroll. As the city readies for the moisture, you might find solace in the vibrant glow of a local caf\u00e9 or the quiet comforts of home, where the sound of rain can serenade the soul.",
