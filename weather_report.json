    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts a muted glow, hinting at a pleasant warmth before the clouds roll in. With temperatures hovering around 55 degrees, the city enjoys a brief respite from the chill, although a subtle coolness lingers in the air. The northeast wind whispers through the streets, a gentle reminder of winter's approach. However, this clarity is short-lived, as the forecast predicts rain later tonight, initiating a shift in the mood of the day. \n\nA layer of clouds is already gathering, promising a transformation as the evening descends. Fog, a constant companion to this city by the bay, lurks at the edges, teasing with hints of its presence, yet the view remains relatively clear for now. As night approaches, expect to don a warm jacket; the cool air will seep in as temperatures dip to the low 40s, accompanied by the sound of rain pattering against rooftops. Today, perhaps a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely visit to one of the local coffee shops would be most rewarding before the weather turns, offering a cozy refuge from the impending drizzle.",
