    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a glass-clear sky, the last ember of twilight long gone and the first hard stars bright above the hills. Today stayed bright and untroubled by clouds; the sunshine was gentle, the kind that sharpens edges without biting, and the UV stayed modest. Now the ultraviolet is essentially asleep, and the air feels crisp and dry, lending the streets a pleasant, clean hush and a sense of long sightlines.\n\nIt looks like a quietly lovely night, better for layers than bravado: a warm coat, a scarf, shoes with some heft, perhaps thin gloves if you linger. With the weather so steady, you might take an unhurried loop to return a library book, pick up milk, or stand a minute to watch the lights gather in shop windows; at home, crack a window for a brief airing, oil the bicycle chain, or draft a note you\u2019ve been meaning to write. If you step outside later, the sky will reward you with uncomplicated stars.",
