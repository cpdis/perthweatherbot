    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Albany, the streets wear a sheen from last night\u2019s light rain, and the sky feels hushed and low. Clouds are the main act for now, muting any hint of sunrise; the air has that damp, faintly cool edge that softens sound and color. UV is negligible this early and will likely stay modest unless the overcast thins. Expect a mostly gray morning with a chance of spotty drizzle and only brief, shy breaks of brightness later, if at all. It\u2019s not unpleasant so much as subdued, a day that asks you to slow down and keep the kettle close.\n\nDress in easy layers with a light waterproof shell and shoes that don\u2019t mind wet sidewalks; tuck a compact umbrella in your bag. This is good weather for a quiet coffee, a tidy-up before the day unfurls, or an unhurried trip to the market when it opens. If the clouds lift a little toward midday, take a gentle walk between showers and enjoy the silvery light on the trees, but plan errands that don\u2019t demand sunshine. All told, a soft, gray day with low glare and low UV, best met with patience and comfortable clothes.",
