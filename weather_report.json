    "weather_report": "As the night drapes its cool fabric over Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a soft haze, with the potential for a gently falling drizzle before dawn. The cloudy sky speaks of an impending rain, a fitting backdrop for a Saturday evening when the warmth of home might beckon. The air carries a crisp chill, nudging the temperatures toward the mid-fifties. Early risers tomorrow will encounter a landscape where thick clouds hang low, with the likelihood of rain intensifying as the day unfolds; one can almost sense the shadows of fog curling around familiar landmarks, whispering of oceanic promises just beyond view.\n\nVeterans Day promises to be a mix of overcast gray clouds and the occasional teasing glint of sunlight. The breeze, slightly stronger this time, suggests a brisk walk might be invigorating, yet one should don layers to fend off the creeping chill. A light raincoat or sweater will serve well against the dampness that may punctuate afternoon activities. While outdoor excursions might be a tad dampened, the allure of cozy cafes or quiet bookstores can transform this rainy day into a soothing retreat. Gather with friends over warm drinks or lose oneself in the pages of a good book as the soft patter of rain accompanies the day, creating a gentle symphony that only the heart of San Francisco can provide.",
