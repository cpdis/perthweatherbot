    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco and the sky is swept clean, cloudless and quietly confident. The forecast holds to that purity, so the stars feel nearer and the streetlights seem steadier, with no haze to blunt the edges. UV is effectively asleep at this hour; when the sun returns to such bare blue, expect a bright, unfiltered glare and a brisk climb in UV through late morning, the kind that asks for a little respect.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple, pleasant night for small things: a gentle stroll to the shop, an unhurried loop with the dog, or a window-cracked drive with the radio murmuring. Dress in easy layers\u2014breathable fabrics now, a light jacket if you run cool\u2014and keep tomorrow\u2019s kit ready with sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out around midday. The day ahead looks clear and straightforward, the kind of weather that doesn\u2019t make a fuss and quietly invites you to get on with whatever you had in mind.",
