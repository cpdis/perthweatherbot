    "weather_report": "The gentle cadence of rain has been caressing Perth since morning, creating a subtle symphony with every drop that meets the earth. It's now mid-afternoon, and the skies remain a tapestry of muted gray, whispering of earlier showers that linger like the final notes of a melody just played. The air carries a cool embrace, refreshing yet tinged with the promise of more moisture to come. It's an introspective kind of day, where light is filtered through thick clouds and the anticipation of the next spell of rain seems to lie heavy over the city.\n\nThe sun remains an elusive visitor today, playing hide and seek behind an overcast veil, casting barely a shadow through the curtain of clouds. The UV index sits low, a rare reprieve from the usual bright blaze of an Aussie afternoon. For those venturing outside, a light rain jacket or an umbrella will provide comfort while walking along the leaf-strewn streets, where the patter of raindrops forms the day's natural soundtrack. This afternoon beckons for taking slow strolls through the neighborhood or perhaps retreating indoors with a captivating book, the perfect backdrop being the soft rhythm of raindrops tapping against windowpanes. Gentle, understated, and inviting reflection, today is for savoring simple moments and letting the rain's lullaby guide your thoughts.",
