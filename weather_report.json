    "weather_report": "A soft rain has been passing over Denmark from late afternoon into the evening, the sky a low, uniform lid that turns edges woolly and beads the pavements with a quiet shimmer. Sunshine is essentially absent now, and the UV index has fallen to negligible; earlier in the day there were few, if any, bright breaks. Visibility is serviceable but subdued, with streetlights wearing halos and distance losing its sharpness as the drizzle lingers.\n\nIt feels damp rather than punishing. A light waterproof, closed shoes, and a small umbrella are enough; add a thin sweater if you run cool. For this hour, think modest errands close to home, a short walk to post a letter or return a library book, then back to a warm lamp and the steady companionable patter on the window. Cyclists and walkers should click on their lights and watch for slick leaves. Expect the showers to loiter a bit longer before thinning later tonight, leaving the air rinsed and quiet.",
