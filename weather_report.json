    "weather_report": "Denmark woke to a rinse of light rain, and by late morning the sky fractured into moving panes of cloud with small, silvery windows of sun. At midday the light is gentle rather than showy; the sun will peek now and then but won\u2019t take command, and the UV index stays low, nudging up only briefly when a gap opens. The air feels freshly washed and slightly cool, puddles still stitching the pavements; clarity comes in pulses, crisp when the sun finds you, soft and pewter-toned when it slips away. Expect the rest of the day to hold to this pattern of broken cloud with mostly dry spells and the odd passing sprinkle. Dress for a mild, damp-leaning afternoon: a light waterproof over a sweater, trousers you don\u2019t mind brushing a hedge with, and shoes that ignore shallow puddles. It\u2019s a good day for errands by foot, a quiet spin on the bike between showers, or a caf\u00e9 window seat that lets you watch the light turn the rooftops on and off.",
