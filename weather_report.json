    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a quilt of broken cloud, the day\u2019s earlier patches of sun dimming into a muted, pewter sky. The light is soft and indirect now, with the UV index essentially at rest; any brightness left is the afterglow smoothing across rooftops and stone. The air feels mild to gently cool, and the view is more textured than clear, as if the horizon had been rubbed with charcoal. It looks quietly pleasant rather than dazzling, a night made for unhurried steps and low voices.\n\nFrom here on it stays mostly cloudy, no harsh glare ahead and no need to think about sun protection. A light jacket or soft sweater suits the hour; add a scarf if you run cold. This is good weather for simple things: a short stroll to pick up bread, a calm circuit of the neighborhood, a window cracked open while you put the kettle on, or a small chore you\u2019ve been meaning to finish. Let the evening be modest and intact, and take the long way home.",
