    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries the scent of approaching rain, a prelude to the drumming of droplets expected soon. The sky is cloaked in heavy clouds, tinged with the promise of thunderstorms that will grace the city until early morning, followed by a steady rain. A slight chill permeates the atmosphere, inviting residents to wrap themselves in layers for warmth as temperatures hover around 53, gradually nudging upwards to 55. The wind whistles softly, a reminder of its power with occasional gusts that sweep through the area, restless and lively.\n\nTomorrow, a fresh day awaits, with a chance of morning drizzle giving way to a more cheerful sun that may eventually break through the clouds. As the day unfolds, the warmth could touch the low 60s, promising a reprieve from the dampness lingering from the night before. Dress in comfortable layers to embrace the cool yet brightening afternoon. It\u2019s a fine opportunity to sip coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while watching the city awaken from its soggy slumber, or perhaps meander through the streets with a friend, finding moments of joy in the lingering crispness of the season, unwinding into the day ahead.",
