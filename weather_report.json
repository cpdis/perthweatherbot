    "weather_report": "It\u2019s early afternoon in Innaloo and the light feels clean and insistent, the kind that sharpens edges and sends colors humming. Expect a mostly sunny stretch through the early afternoon with a clear, high sky; by late afternoon a scatter of friendly cloud should drift in and take a bit of the glare off. The UV will be very high through the peak hours, so the sun will feel direct and unblinking even as a sea-breeze stirs later and lends the air a gentler touch. Overall it\u2019s a bright, dry, good-spirited day with excellent visibility.\n\nDress for the light more than the temperature: airy fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen you don\u2019t forget to reapply. Step out briefly for errands now if you must, then save the longer stroll for mid to late afternoon when the breeze arrives and the light softens. It\u2019s a fine day to let a load of washing snap dry on the line, to open the windows and air the rooms, to sit by a shaded window with a cool drink and make a quiet plan for the week. Toward late afternoon, a gentle neighborhood walk or a quick ride to the shops will feel just right.",
