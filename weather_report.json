    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Bend beneath a polished, cloudless sky. The last light fades to indigo and the air turns crisp, the kind that sharpens the silhouette of the Cascades. Sunshine is now a brief afterthought, slipping away with a negligible UV presence; what follows is gentle twilight and, soon, clean, starry dark.\n\nSkies stay clear through the evening and night, so visibility will be excellent while temperatures lean toward the cold side of comfortable. Dress in warm layers with a sturdy coat, plus a hat and gloves if you linger outdoors. Streets should feel uncomplicated, though a watchful step is wise in shaded corners. This is good weather for small, ordinary pleasures: an unhurried loop around the block, a quick grocery run before the day fully closes, or a quiet pause on the porch to let your eyes adjust and find the first bright points above. Indoors, let something simple simmer on the stove and sort tomorrow\u2019s list while the night settles, bright and uncomplicated.",
