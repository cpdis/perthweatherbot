    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a subtle hint of rain whispers through the air, accompanied by a shroud of clouds that dim the usual vibrancy of the city. With temperatures hovering close to a nippy 60 degrees, the chill in the air invites a cozy attire; indeed, a light jacket or sweater should serve you well against the gentle breeze drifting in from the south. The prospect of rain, though minimal, looms\u2014a mere 20% chance promising a few droplets may grace the streets between 2 and 4 PM.\n\nAs night approaches, the mood shifts dramatically, with darkened skies pouring forth substantial rain between 10 PM and 4 AM, transforming the landscape into a symphony of showers and potential thunderstorms. The foreboding forecast hints at a thorough drenching, with total rainfall expected to reach nearly three-quarters of an inch. Amidst this weather, the city remains draped in a foggy embrace, typical of coastal charm, making it a perfect evening for quiet indoor pursuits. Whether diving into the pages of a novel at a local caf\u00e9 or exploring the rich flavors of the evening\u2019s culinary offerings, there\u2019s solace to be found within the city\u2019s warm enclaves.",
