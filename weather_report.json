    "weather_report": "A blanket of rain drapes over Downtown San Francisco tonight, with droplets tapping rhythmically against the windows and the wind stirring the deeper echoes of the city. The temperature hovers in the cool embrace of the low fifties, as gusts sweep through, reminding one of the raw, wild beauty of a long winter's night. Tomorrow, the rain is set to dance with a different energy, accentuated by occasional thunderstorms. The sprawling streets, often bustling with life, might seem subdued under the weight of the clouds, casting a soft, muted light over the buildings, as the afternoon promises a gradual descent into cooler temperatures.\n\nThe fog is likely to weave itself through the corners of the skyline, painting an ethereal layer across familiar landmarks, while further hints of marine air may cling close. Given the damp and unpredictable weather, layers will be your ally\u2014think cozy sweaters paired with water-resistant outerwear. As the day progresses, a quiet stroll through the embrace of the rain might be an ideal way to connect with the city's hidden corners, perhaps while enjoying a comforting cup of coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9, watching the world go by behind misty glass.",
