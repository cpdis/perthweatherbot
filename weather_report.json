    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the air carries a distinct chill as the sun struggles to break through a canopy of clouds. A hint of rain lingers in the atmosphere, as if the heavens are gathering their thoughts, and the temperature hovers near a brisk 56 degrees. It\u2019s a day where nature chants its own lullaby, a gentle reminder that the city by the bay can shift from serene to tempestuous at a moment\u2019s notice. The south wind whispers quietly, rustling leaves and nudging the clouds closer, creating a dynamic tableau that ebbs and flows with each passing minute.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds grow more assertive, promising rain that will drench the streets and cool the air even further. Tonight, a light rainfall will accompany the low of around 51, inviting the familiar smell of wet pavement and a sense of cozy solitude. For those navigating the city, a light jacket and perhaps a sturdy umbrella are in order; comfort is key against the impending damp. You might find it a perfect evening to curl up in a favorite caf\u00e9, savoring the warmth of a steaming beverage while watching the city transform under a shroud of mist and raindrops. Or, for the adventurous, a leisurely stroll through the quiet streets can reveal the beauty of a city embraced by fog, each droplet a small testament to the urban romance of San Francisco.",
