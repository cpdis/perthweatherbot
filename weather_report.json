    "weather_report": "A quiet Sunday dawn settles over San Francisco with a low quilt of cloud, the kind that mutes the streets and keeps the light soft and slow. As morning unfolds, broken cloud gives way to a heavier overcast, so any sun will be fleeting at best; the UV will stay low, gentle on the skin and easy on the eyes. The air should feel cool and a touch damp, the horizon softened but visibility otherwise fair\u2014more a veiled day than a murky one.\n\nIt looks like a day for understatement: a light jacket over a sweater, something you can shrug on and off, with a scarf in your bag just in case. Walk the neighborhood with a warm cup in hand, poke into the corner market for the week\u2019s staples, or claim a window seat and catch up on a book while the city yawns awake. Later, tidy a drawer, draft a note you\u2019ve been meaning to send, or take a slow errand loop between clouds that promise calm rather than drama.",
