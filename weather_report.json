    "weather_report": "As the night deepens in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm blankets the city, with partly cloudy skies yielding to the thrill of a new day just beyond the horizon. The air is cool, whispering of a low temperature that settles around fifty degrees, yet there\u2019s a rising warmth heading towards dawn. The north-northeast winds breathe lightly, with just the right amount of vigor to play with the edges of your coat. \n\nCome Wednesday, the sun will break through, bringing forth a cheerful brightness that promises a high near sixty-two. The clouds will retreat, making space for an uplifting clarity that feels almost celebratory. While the temperatures might dip slightly in the afternoon, the gentle northeast breeze, still in tow, will gift you a refreshing reminder of the winter\u2019s crispness. The marine layer currently lingering near the Golden Gate likely blends gracefully with the lingering shadows of the night, while the day will reveal a haze-free view, ideal for a leisurely stroll. Encapsulate yourself in layers\u2014perhaps a lightweight cardigan over a long-sleeve shirt, perfect for the morning chill but adaptable for the warmth to follow. With favorable weather on the horizon, it\u2019s an ideal time to embrace the local coffee shop culture, perhaps lose yourself in a book at one of the parks, or take a quiet walk along the waterfront, absorbing the slowly awakening city around you.",
