    "weather_report": "Subiaco is quiet at this hour, the streets washed in a deep pre-dawn blue and the air pleasantly cool. The sky is mostly clear, lending the morning a crisp, orderly feel; visibility is clean and the first hints of light are waiting just offstage.\n\nAfter sunrise, expect a bright, largely sunny day with only a stray drift of cloud by midmorning, more a veil than a lid. The UV will climb quickly once the sun is up, likely moderate to high by late morning, so plan on sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out for long. A light layer now will feel right, easy to shed to short sleeves later. It looks like a comfortable, good-mood day: hang the washing early, stroll for a coffee as the light sharpens, water the balcony herbs, then run errands on foot or bicycle before the sun grows insistent. By late morning, find shade and let the brightness do its work while you browse the library or take a quiet lap through the grocer, returning home with the day still gleaming at the edges.",
