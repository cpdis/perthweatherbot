    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air is calm and cool, with a light breeze whispering through the streets. The skies are partly cloudy, holding onto the promise of a refreshingly bright day ahead. With temperatures drifting down to the low 40s, it will be wise to don a light jacket or a cozy sweater before heading out into the gentle night. The tranquility of the evening invites a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the distant shimmer of the Bay lights dances atop the water, reflecting the city's quiet charm.\n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the sun will rise to paint the day with cheerful warmth, climbing to a pleasant high near 63, although it will cool off to about 58 by afternoon. The gentle northwest winds will carry away any lingering chill, but the clarity of the day may be punctuated by patches of fog as the marine layer glides in from the ocean. As the urban landscape awakens, it\u2019s an opportune moment for a thoughtful morning walk through Golden Gate Park or a leisurely brunch at a local caf\u00e9, savoring the warmth of coffee while watching the world come alive. For a cozy Sunday in San Francisco, layering your attire will keep you comfortable throughout the varied temperatures of the day, allowing you to embrace the city\u2019s laid-back elegance fully.",
