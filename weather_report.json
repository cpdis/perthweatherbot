    "weather_report": "Late afternoon drifts in under a quilt of broken cloud, the sun thinning to a pale coin and the light turning gentle and cool. Expect only fleeting brightness from here; UV is low now and sliding toward negligible by dusk. The air is clear enough for long views, though the horizon wears a soft blur, and a mild onshore breeze keeps things comfortable without the sting of glare.\n\nInto the evening, the ceiling lowers and a light, courteous rain is likely to brush the city. It looks quietly pleasant, if a touch damp. Dress in light layers with a compact rain shell or umbrella, and shoes that don\u2019t mind wet pavement. Good time to finish a short walk or a last errand before the sprinkles arrive, or let the weather nudge you indoors to simmer something simple on the stove, tidy a corner of the house, or read by the window as the first drops find the glass. If you\u2019re commuting, an unhurried pace will suit the slick roads.",
