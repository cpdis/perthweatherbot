    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts past midnight under a quiet sky, the air cool and settled, stars finding their way between a few clouds that thicken toward dawn. It feels calm rather than cold, the sort of night that softens edges and hushes the streets; clarity is decent, with only veils of cloud to mute the glow toward morning.\n\nExpect a day that opens with patchy cloud and bright intervals, more silvered sunshine than blaze at first, then a clearer, gentler blue as the morning matures. UV details aren\u2019t provided, but in late October here the sun flexes quickly after breakfast; plan on shade, sunscreen, and a hat if you\u2019ll linger outdoors. A light layer suits the small hours; trade it for breathable fabrics, sunglasses, and comfortable shoes by mid-morning. If you\u2019re awake now, a quiet read by an open window or a kettle on the boil fits the mood; after first light, an easy walk for coffee, a few errands while the sun is still kind, or tending a small garden would feel right. Save the longer stretch in the open for earlier or later in the day, letting midday brightness be admired from the cool side of a veranda.",
