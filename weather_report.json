    "weather_report": "Floreat wakes under a rinsed-blue sky, the morning sun already smoothing the cool edge from the air. Light is clean and honest, the kind that sharpens greens and throws crisp shadows across verandas; visibility feels almost crystalline, no haze to speak of.\n\nThe day holds steady and simple: clear skies through late morning and into the afternoon, plenty of sunshine. UV is mild now but will rise to a moderate bite around midday, so carry a hat and sunglasses, and give your skin a little armor. Dress in light layers you can peel back as the warmth gathers. It\u2019s the sort of pleasant, uncomplicated day made for ordinary pleasures\u2014an amble through Bold Park, a slow coffee by a window, pegging out laundry, a quick ride to the shops, or a tidy in the garden while the light does its gentle work. Open the house to the breeze, keep some water at hand, and let the afternoon unfold without hurry.",
