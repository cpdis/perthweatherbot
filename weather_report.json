    "weather_report": "Midday in Perth feels bright and lucid, the sun shouldering through a shifting veil of cloud. Expect the afternoon to open with more broken cloud, then ease toward cleaner, scattered patches as the day leans to evening, giving the light a silvery glaze rather than a hard glare. UV is very high now and will stay punchy through the early afternoon before softening later, so shade is your ally and the day will feel warm to hot, crisp-edged and dry under a generous sky.\n\nLight, breathable layers with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen will serve you well; carry water and give your skin a break where you can. Save longer errands or a lazy walk under trees for later in the day when the sun gentles and the sky clears, or linger at a quiet caf\u00e9 veranda with a book. It\u2019s a good afternoon for hanging a wash, tending a few plants in the shade, or a slow loop along the river paths once the light goes honeyed.",
