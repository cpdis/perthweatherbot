    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds hangs in the sky, whispering a gentle chill that dips down to around 46 degrees. The air carries the promise of a cool breeze from the north-northeast, stirring memories of brighter mornings. The golden glow of lights twinkles like stars scattered across a velvet night, yet the famed fog, that elusive motif of the Bay, has drawn a discreet curtain over much of the cityscape, offering only hints of its presence along the fringes of the Golden Gate.\n\nTomorrow greets us with the advent of a mostly sunny day, beckoning residents and visitors alike to step outside and embrace the crisp air. Morning sunshine will rise gently, peaking towards a high near 60, only to soften to a cool 55 as the sun takes its bow in the afternoon. As you venture out, don\u2019t forget a light jacket to navigate the lingering coolness, and perhaps wear a scarf to ward off the chill that traipses through the streets. It\u2019s a perfect day for a casual stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee amidst the vibrant energy of Market Street. These are the moments that bring a quiet joy\u2014a balm to the soul as the city reawakens from its fog-laden slumber.",
