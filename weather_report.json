    "weather_report": "Subiaco stirs under a clear pre-dawn sky, the air quiet and uncomplicated, as the first hint of light finds the edges of roofs and gums. Forecasts keep the canvas simple: clear at sunrise, clear into midmorning, the kind of blue that feels rinsed and precise. Expect a bright day ahead with little in the way of haze; as the sun strengthens, UV will ramp up quickly and, in this season, tends to reach the high range by late morning. The day looks clean-lined and sunny, the sort that flatters shadows and makes colors ring.\n\nDress with a light layer for the cool start, ready to shed into something breezy once the sun takes charge, and bring a hat and sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger outdoors. It\u2019s a gentle hour for a quiet walk to the bakery or a coffee on a veranda, windows open to let the house breathe. Water the garden before the glare, run small errands early, and save any linger-in-the-park plans for a shaded bench. If you\u2019re working from home, set up near a window and let the morning light do its steadying work, then take a brief sun-safe break before the day gathers speed.",
