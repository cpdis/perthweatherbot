With a low settling around fifty, the northwest breeze carries whispers of the ocean, soft yet persistent at six miles per hour. The world feels serene, though a veil of moisture lingers\u2014perhaps a trace of fog hugging the shoreline, a signature of the city's coastal charm. Those venturing out might want to don a light jacket, something cozy for layering, as the air grows crisper with each passing hour.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the day promises a tantalizing shift. Clouds will part to unveil mostly sunny skies, inviting a warming high near sixty-one before afternoon temperatures dip gently to a cooler fifty-seven. The northwesterly breeze should keep things refreshing. A morning stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps to enjoy a quiet coffee by the bay, would be perfect as the city awakens to a brighter canvas. Enjoy the sweet simplicity of wandering, the flavors of the neighborhood wafting through the air, as the Golden Gate emerges in the distance, framed by an uncharacteristically clear sky.",
