The day has been a clear one, and it remains so; the air feels open and uncluttered, colors sharp along the streets. Brightness is fading quickly now, and with it the UV sting has fallen away to almost nothing.\n\nThrough the rest of tonight the heavens stay simple and untroubled, a quietly pleasant close to a summer day. Dress for ease: short sleeves while the warmth lingers, with a light layer at hand once the night air steadies. It\u2019s good weather for ordinary comforts\u2014an unhurried walk to the shops, a simple dinner in the courtyard, sorting a few errands on foot, or finishing a chapter on the veranda while the sky deepens. With the clear backdrop and calm feel, travel and visibility are straightforward; leave the sunscreen on the counter and enjoy the clean, unbothered night.",
