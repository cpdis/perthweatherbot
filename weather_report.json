    "weather_report": "As the early hours of a crisp San Francisco morning unfold, the city lies under a serene blanket of clarity. With temperatures beginning to rise gently from a cool 46 degrees, the absence of fog tonight reveals a skyline embracing the promise of a sunny day ahead. The gentle north-northeast wind, brushing past at a modest 7 mph, offers a refreshing caress rather than a chill, creating an inviting atmosphere for those who dare to step outside.\n\nThe forecast for the day hints at more warmth as the sun rises toward its zenith, peaking at around 63 degrees, before settling back into a comfortable mid-60s evening. The city, unwrapped from any foggy embrace, appears vibrant, with the clear blue skies complementing the unmistakable charm of the streets below. As daylight pours in, options abound. A leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, or perhaps a gentle bicycle ride through Golden Gate Park could be delightful pursuits. The coolness of the morning makes a light jacket or a cozy sweater a wise choice, transitioning seamlessly into a more relaxed attire as the day warms. Embrace the unfolding day with an open heart, for it promises moments of simple beauty wrapped in the unique rhythm of San Francisco life.",
