    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco wraps itself in a shroud of clear sky this afternoon, basking in the gentle glow of the sun. With temperatures hovering around a pleasant coolness, the air brings with it the comforting embrace of a light west wind, whispering to the trees and rustling the leaves. The day unfolds with radiant clarity, a far cry from the foggy embrace typical of this coastal city. The Golden Gate remains proudly visible, its iconic arches defined against the backdrop of a crisp blue sky, seemingly inviting all to step outside and explore.\n\nAs the sun dips lower, expect temperatures to slide gently into the evening's embrace, where a sense of calm prevails under the stars with a low set around the mid-forties. A slight breeze from the north northwest adds to the evening's charm, encouraging a stroll through the neighborhood or perhaps a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9. For those wondering how to dress, layering remains key\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a shirt to keep comfortably warm. With the sky uncharacteristically devoid of fog, now is an ideal time for an exploration of nearby parks or a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the city glimmers like a treasure under the fading light.",
