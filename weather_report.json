    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into late afternoon under a bruised sky, the light already thinning as a band of heavy rain noses in around dusk and then loosens to gentler showers into the evening. Sunshine will be scarce, the UV index subdued beneath thick cloud, and the view down the street will blur at the edges as windscreen wipers and wet asphalt set the tone. It\u2019s not a clear day so much as a soft one, colors muted and reflections brightening the puddles to a silvery sheen.\n\nIt looks more contemplative than cheerful, but perfectly serviceable if you dress for it: a light waterproof with a hood, quick-dry layers, and shoes that won\u2019t mind slick pavements; an umbrella if you like the ceremony of it. Good hours for small, useful errands under awnings, a quiet lap through the grocer before the dinner rush, or an unhurried stop at a neighborhood cafe while the worst of it passes. At home, straighten the desk for the week ahead, simmer something simple, or take a short, hooded stroll between showers just to feel the change in the air.",
