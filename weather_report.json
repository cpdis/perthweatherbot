The temperature is comfortably cool, hovering around the low forties, hinting at the chill that will envelop the evening. With a mild west-northwest wind, the air carries a whisper of dampness, evoking that ever-present allure of the bay. \n\nTomorrow promises a more welcoming embrace with partly sunny skies. However, don\u2019t expect the warmth of a blazing sun; the high will reach a modest fifty-seven, gradually cooling into the mid-fifties by afternoon. While there may be patchy fog lingering near the coast, the clouds appear to be parting, allowing for occasional glimpses of sunlight that beckon toward leisurely pursuits. A light jacket will be your best companion for the evening stroll, while tomorrow calls for layers\u2014perhaps a stylish scarf to fend off the chill and a comfortable pair of shoes for those spontaneous jaunts through the city\u2019s enchanting streets. Those looking to explore might consider a meandering walk along the waterfront, where the sights and sounds of the bay infuse every step with the essence of San Francisco\u2019s unique charm.",
