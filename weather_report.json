    "weather_report": "The evening sky over Downtown San Francisco unfolds in tranquil clarity, with the remnants of sunlight gently fading into subdued hues. A cool breeze stirs, playfully rustling the leaves as it carries the unmistakable crispness of a November night. Temperatures settle comfortably around fifty-five degrees, while gusts from the north northwest reach up to thirty-seven miles per hour, lending a spirited chill to the air. For those venturing outdoors, a light jacket layered over a comfortable sweater may provide the perfect equilibrium between warmth and coolness.\n\nAs the night deepens, the city is set to embrace a sunny Monday, with the promise of bright skies and highs around sixty-eight degrees. The morning will reveal the sun bathing the streets in its golden glow, gradually giving way to cooler temperatures in the afternoon. Delightful winds at moderate speeds invite residents to enjoy casual strolls through the park or to visit a cozy bistro in the heart of the city. There\u2019s a refreshing charm in these conditions, offering ample opportunity for quiet reflection or lively conversations with friends as the crisp air invigorates the spirit of the city.",
