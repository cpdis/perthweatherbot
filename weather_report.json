    "weather_report": "As the evening settles into Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cover of clouds blankets the sky, casting a soothing gray hue over the bustling city. The temperature dips to a crisp 50 degrees, inviting one to wrap themselves in layers. Streetlights flicker to life, adding warmth to the urban canvas while the faint sigh of west winds dances softly at 5 mph, bringing with it a whisper of the sea's chill. Tonight, the stars may choose to play coy, hidden behind the clouds, while the distant Golden Gate Bridge stands as a silent guardian, veiled by an approaching marine layer.\n\nTomorrow dawns with promise, as the forecast hints at a transition to mostly sunny skies. Expect temperatures to flirt with 62 degrees in the morning, gradually falling as the day unfolds. A gentle northwest breeze will meander through the streets, creating an ideal atmosphere for a leisurely walk. With this interplay of warmth and coolness, it would be wise to don a light jacket or a cozy sweater that can be layered over a casual attire. As the city awakens, consider a meandering stroll through the vibrant neighborhoods, perhaps indulging in a quiet caf\u00e9 nook to enjoy a warm drink while the world around slowly comes to life. The day may be ordinary, yet the beauty of San Francisco lies in its ability to make the mundane an unforgettable experience.",
