    "weather_report": "As the sun dips lower this afternoon, casting a golden hue over the city, Downtown San Francisco relishes a calm, sunny interlude, the air crisp and invigorating. Temperatures hover around a gentle 62 degrees, with a cooling breeze wafting through the streets. While the view towards the Golden Gate reveals the fading outlines of iconic structures, the marine layer appears but a whisper, cloaking the furthest reaches in soft, ethereal mist. The valleys and hills are kissed by the sunlight, providing a delightful contrast to the occasional cloud drifting lazily by.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will don a partly cloudy cloak, dropping to a mild 50 degrees, where a cozy sweater or light jacket will serve as perfect companions for those venturing out. You might wander to a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while gazing out at the glittering cityscape, or simply meander along the waterfront, where the last traces of daylight dance upon the waves. Tonight, San Francisco invites gentle exploration, to witness the city unfold into its evening charm under twinkling lights and the soft embrace of a cool breeze.",
