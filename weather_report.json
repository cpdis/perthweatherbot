    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the atmosphere is heavy with moisture, casting a veil over the city. Drizzle lingers in the air, intermingling with the thick clouds that shroud the skyline. The forecast hints at temperatures hovering around 59, dipping slightly by afternoon, while the south winds add a chill that creeps into the bones, tugging at jackets and scarves. With a 60% chance of precipitation, the light rain promises to provide little more than a whisper on the streets, lasting through the night along with a chance of drizzle before more substantial rain moves in.\n\nVisibility is muted, and the ever-present marine layer blankets the bay, hiding the Golden Gate Bridge and carrying the scent of salt and damp earth. As the day unfolds into evening, the clouds will thicken, creating a cozy backdrop for indoor activities. It\u2019s a good day to nest in a caf\u00e9 with a warm drink, perhaps a spot where the warm light flickers against the gray outside, or to visit a local gallery where creativity flourishes apart from the damp chill. Layering up is advisable; a comfortable sweater under a waterproof jacket will keep the cool air at bay while allowing for pleasant wanderings through the streets, even if it means getting a little wet.",
