    "weather_report": "As morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a delicate blanket of fog lingers, pulling back only slightly to reveal patches of blue sky. While visibility may be somewhat muted, the city stands shrouded in a gentle mix of sunlight and shadow, a reminder of the marine layer often embraced by this coastal landscape. As the day progresses, the warmth of the sun, although limited, teases the cool temperatures hovering around the upper 50s. It feels like a quiet invitation to explore.\n\nCome nightfall, the atmosphere shifts as rain makes its anticipated arrival, heralded by a mostly cloudy sky. The temperature will gently rise to a comfortable low around the low 50s, while the wind begins to carry with it the promise of droplets. A well-prepared San Franciscan might bundle up in layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket paired with a cozy sweater\u2014to stave off the chill, best suited for an evening stroll through the fog-sweetened streets or the warmth of a nearby caf\u00e9 with a good book in tow, embracing the solitude that often accompanies this mesmerizing weather.",
