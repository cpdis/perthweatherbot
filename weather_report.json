    "weather_report": "As evening descends over Downtown San Francisco, a dense shroud of clouds blankets the city, bringing with it a steady drizzle that taps gently against windows and rooftops. The air carries a crispness that mingles with the scent of fresh rain, a reminder of nature's touch even in the urban landscape. With temperatures settling around the low fifties, the southwest wind whispers through the streets, occasionally gusting to create a ripple in the otherwise intimate atmosphere.\n\nTomorrow promises more of the same, with rain likely to continue throughout the day as temperatures hover in the mid to upper fifties. The sky remains a muted grey, muted by the soggy embrace of the clouds and the persistent marine layer that hugs the coastline, creating a sense of soft enclosure. Dress warmly in layers, donning waterproof shoes to navigate puddled sidewalks and a jacket that both keeps out the chill and holds off the damp. This weather invites an indoor reprieve; consider cozying up with a book at one of the city's inviting coffee shops, where the warmth contrasts beautifully with the cool weather outside. Or indulge in a culinary adventure at a local eatery, where the seasonal menus may feature hearty dishes meant to comfort and restore in this moody, reflective weather.",
