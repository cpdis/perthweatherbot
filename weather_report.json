    "weather_report": "At this small hour in Denmark the sky is a quilt of broken cloud left behind by last night\u2019s overcast, the air cool and a little damp, the streets hushed. Dawn will be gentle and gray, with the sun slipping in and out of rifts rather than taking center stage; expect a day of muted light and soft edges, more silver than blue. The UV is low, a suggestion rather than a warning, so the brightness will feel diffuse and kind to the eyes, the horizon a touch veiled but steady.\n\nIt looks quietly pleasant rather than sparkling. Dress in easy layers: a long-sleeve or knit under a light, windproof jacket, perhaps a scarf for the ride or walk, and shoes you don\u2019t mind on damp pavement. Good hours for unhurried errands, a tram to the library when it opens, a bicycle roll to the bakery, or a tidy of the desk and balcony plants while the kettle works. Later, if the clouds thin, take a slow loop around the neighborhood or find a window seat and let the pale light do its calming work.",
