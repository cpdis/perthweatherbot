    "weather_report": "Before sunrise in Subiaco, the sky wears scattered cloud like a loose shawl, the streets still and silvered, the air a touch cool on the skin. The light is muted and gentle, with visibility good but the edges of things softened by moisture in the air. UV is minimal at this hour, the sun still biding its time below the horizon.\n\nAround breakfast, light rain is likely to drift through, trading any chance of bright sunshine for a soft, gray morning. Don a light layer with a rain shell or compact umbrella, and shoes that won\u2019t sulk at puddles. It looks pleasant in a quiet, contemplative way rather than sparkling; a day to sit by a window with a coffee, to run a small errand between showers, to take a short walk when the drizzle eases. UV should stay low through the morning under cloud, but if the sky opens later, spring light can sharpen quickly\u2014tuck a hat or sunscreen in your bag just in case.",
