    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a radiant sun, casting a warm glow over the city\u2019s iconic skyline. With temperatures hovering around a brisk 59 degrees, a gentle westward breeze whispers through the streets, coaxing away any lingering chill. The visibility is sharp and clear, a rarity in this coastal enclave, affording an unobstructed view of the Golden Gate Bridge standing sentinel against the azure backdrop. The absence of fog highlights the vibrant colors of urban life, a stark contrast to the often muted palette of late-season coastal weather.\n\nAs evening draws near, the skies will remain largely clear, dipping to a mild 48 degrees, an invitation to cozy up with a light jacket or a warm scarf. This tranquil weather is perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the city's parks where golden hues of fall leave dance softly in the cooling air. Whether sipping a warm beverage at a local caf\u00e9 or engaging in friendly conversation at an outdoor table, today\u2019s pleasant conditions offer an ideal setting to savor the understated beauty of a San Francisco day.",
