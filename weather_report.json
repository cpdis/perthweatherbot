    "weather_report": "As dawn begins to break over Downtown San Francisco, a whisper of clouds gently drapes the skyline, the waning chill of the night hanging in the air like a lingering soft embrace. The temperature hovers at a brisk 49 degrees, and a subtle breeze from the east southeast stirs ever so lightly, adding a refreshing crispness to the morning. With mostly sunny skies expected as the day unfolds, the horizon hints at a more inviting scene where the sun will gradually assert itself, ultimately reaching a high near 58 degrees, before the cool air returns in the afternoon. \n\nFor those who find themselves amidst the city's dynamic pulse, it appears that the marine layer remains at bay, allowing for more clarity in the views towards the iconic Golden Gate. Although pockets of fog can occasionally roll in from the bay, their presence today seems significantly diminished, offering an unobstructed grace that is rare for this often-misty environment. Attire will benefit from an extra layer; a light jacket or sweater would lend comfort against the coolness that characterizes such mornings. As the day promises a steady improvement toward sunniness, consider a stroll through one of the city's quiet parks or along the waterfront, where the air feels particularly rejuvenating after a night of cloudy introspection. For the adventurous, a leisurely visit to one of the local cafes could provide the perfect pause before embarking on the day\u2019s explorations, embracing the evolving beauty of this vibrant city as it stretches toward midday.",
