With a high around 58 degrees, a gentle west-southwest wind carries whispers of change from 7 to 13 mph, and the horizon hints at a shifting palette of moody clouds. A 60% chance of precipitation dances in the air, suggesting that the bright moment will soon give way to the inevitable arrival of rain. \n\nTonight, the forecast embraces a full commitment to wet conditions, as a robust 100% chance indicates that the evening will be marked by steady showers amidst a low of 53 degrees. Gusts may reach up to 30 mph, adding an invigorating chill to the coastal air. If the picturesque light of this afternoon lures you outdoors, a light jacket layered over a cozy sweater would suffice, while sturdy shoes would serve well against the slick sidewalks that the impending rain will create. A stroll through the streets, perhaps combined with a stop at a local caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee or tea, could offer a perfect moment to savor the transition of the day. As the sun dips below the horizon, consider retreating indoors to listen to the soft patter of rain\u2014an invitation to reflect or engage in a good book, as the city inevitably settles into its rain-kissed evening.",
