    "weather_report": "Twilight settles over San Francisco with a quilt of broken clouds, the last scraps of daylight dimming to steel-blue. Sunshine is largely spent now, with only brief, fickle hints slipping through the gaps; the UV index is negligible and falling to nothing with the night. The air feels reasonably clear, though the sky is mottled rather than crystalline, giving the city a subdued, reflective cast as evening takes hold and the cloud deck lingers into late night.\n\nIt looks quietly pleasant if a touch cool after dark. A light jacket or soft sweater will suit the hours ahead; add a scarf if you chill easily. This is weather for a practical, unrushed evening: a small grocery run, an amble around the block to stretch the day from your shoulders, tidying a desk while the radio murmurs, or lingering at a corner caf\u00e9 with something warm. If you\u2019re heading out later, think simple and nearby; the sky will be mostly veiled and the mood calm.",
