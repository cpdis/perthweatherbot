    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into night under an open, polished sky. The last of the day\u2019s color has slipped away cleanly, leaving clear air and calm light; it feels unhurried and quietly inviting. With the sun down, there\u2019s no harsh glare to squint against and the UV index has sunk to near zero, making this a gentle, eye-relaxing evening with good visibility and a sense of simple clarity.\n\nThe forecast keeps things cloudless through late evening and into the small hours, so it should stay pleasant if you\u2019re out and about. A light layer or soft cardigan will suit most; take a slightly warmer jacket if you plan to linger on a terrace or along tree-shadowed streets. It\u2019s a nice night to wander to the corner shop, sort tomorrow\u2019s to-do list on the balcony, or water the pots and let the cool air drift through the house. If you\u2019ve been indoors all day, step outside for ten unrushed minutes and breathe; the sky is doing its part.",
