    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is currently enveloped in a kind of muted elegance typical of autumn in the Bay. The clouds hang low, cloaking the day in a subdued gray palette, while the promise of rain builds with the afternoon\u2019s approach. As we inch towards evening, expect the skies to weep gently, a precursory drizzle leading into steadier rains that will dominate the night.\n\nThe view from the higher points of the city reveals a haze over the bay, hinting at the moisture that lingers in the air. Though the late afternoon temperatures hover around a comfortable 62 degrees, a brisk southwest wind introduces a chill, compelling you to reach for layers\u2014a lightweight jacket or a cozy sweater is advisable. Straying too far from shelters may invite unexpected droplets, so perhaps an indoor adventure awaits. Consider immersing yourself in the warmth of a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping on a hot brew while listening to the soft patter of rain outside. Or, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, grab an umbrella and stroll through the quieter streets, where the air smells of impending rain and the city seems poised for a fresh start.",
