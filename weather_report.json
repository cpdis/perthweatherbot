    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the city appears tranquil beneath a canopy of mostly clear skies, signaling a calm night ahead. The air is crisp, with temperatures dipping to the low forties, inviting a cozy embrace from layered garments\u2014perhaps a warm sweater paired with a light jacket to ward off the cool nip of the north-northwest breeze that dances lightly through the streets. Tomorrow promises to greet the city with sunshine, nudging temperatures gently toward a modest sixty, ideal for a midday reprieve from winter's chill.\n\nDespite the current clarity, those familiar with the bay's temperament may sense an undertow of marine influence quietly lurking, though tonight, it remains at bay. Tomorrow's sunlit hours invite a gentle exploration of your surroundings, perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the quaint caf\u00e9s dotting the neighborhood, where the aroma of fresh coffee intertwines with the salty breeze. With a vibrant sky dominating the day and only a whisper of fog lurking beyond the horizon, it is an ever-so-pleasant opportunity to bask in the essence of San Francisco's charm.",
