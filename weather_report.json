    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night breathes a chill with rain showers weaving through the city\u2019s tapestry. The clouds loom low, casting a muted shade over the lights that flicker like stars striving to break through the weight of gray. As evening unfolds into early morning, the wind carries a brisk, determined whisper from the south, swirling around street corners and rustling leaves. With the promise of more rain to come, the air feels both electric and damp, an invitation to retreat indoors.\n\nAs Sunday dawns, expect more rain as the clouds persist, painting the skyline with shades of melancholy. While the temperature hovers in the cool 50s, you\u2019ll encounter another day enveloped in the embrace of moisture and a brisk breeze that may curl against the skin. Dressing in layers, perhaps embracing a comfortable rain jacket paired with sturdy footwear, will serve you well. The foreboding weather may send some sulking indoors, but consider the quiet pleasures of this day\u2014a stroll through a cozy caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup in hand, or perhaps an exploration of the city\u2019s hidden art galleries, where the world outside can feel far away, wrapped in the warmth of creativity and community amidst the rain-soaked ambiance.",
