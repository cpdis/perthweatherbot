    "weather_report": "In the stillness of a cool December morning, the clouds envelop Downtown San Francisco, casting a gentle shadow over the city. A fleeting drizzle whispers through the early dawn, a mere hint of rain lingering in the air, promising little more than a trace. Surrounded by the San Francisco skyline, the muted light filters through the cloud cover, rendering iconic landmarks almost ghostly in their clarity. The marine layer sits comfortably along the edges of the bay, creating an ethereal blanket that unfurls above the Golden Gate Bridge and swathes the hills in a soft embrace.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a gradual shift\u2014a slight chance of rain that may visit the downtown area until the afternoon, but nothing that would warrant a hurried retreat indoors. The temperatures will sway between the low sixties, inviting a wardrobe of layered clothing: perhaps a light sweater paired with a jacket to fend off the chill, especially as the breeze whispers in from the south. Wrap yourself in the comforts of warmth and venture forth to enjoy the day. Consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the atmosphere is more serene than bustling, or settle into one of the local caf\u00e9s. Snuggled into a corner with a warm drink, the world can be observed quietly bustling outside, adding a rich backdrop to the unfolding moments of the day.",
