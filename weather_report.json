The highs will hover around 59 degrees, with a gentle west wind ushering in a crispness that feels pleasantly invigorating. The clarity of the day is stunning\u2014sky blue stretches infinitely, unmarred by fog or the lingering veil of a marine layer. As the afternoon progresses, temperatures will dip slightly, inviting layers to ensure comfort against the cooling air.\n\nAs night descends, expect a serene twilight, giving way to a cool evening with lows around 45 degrees. A light northwest breeze will rustle the leaves, transporting whispers of the day into the nocturnal calm. For attire, consider a light jacket layered over a sweater, ideal for keeping warm during an evening stroll along the Embarcadero or a casual sit at one of the many charming cafes. The crisp air calls for a gentle exploration, perhaps a quiet walk through Golden Gate Park, where the paths are lined with towering trees and the soft sounds of nature mingle with the faint hum of the city.",
