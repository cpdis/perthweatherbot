As morning breaks, the forecast hints at a shift, unfurling a tapestry of partly sunny interludes entwined with the likelihood of rain after the mid-morning hours. The day will bring a soothing chill, beginning with a vibrant embrace of 59 degrees, transitioning into a cooler afternoon. The air feels fresh; a slight marine layer may linger, but overall clarity prevails, with the city\u2019s iconic skyline defined against a softening light.\n\nAs the day unfolds, one might consider a stroll through the quiet streets or perhaps a visit to one of the local coffee shops, where the rich aroma of brewing coffee mingles with the anticipation of the day ahead. Dressing in layers is wise\u2014perhaps a light jacket to guard against the cool breeze, and an umbrella tucked away for the afternoon\u2019s forecasted whimsy. Enjoy the moments of serenity that punctuate the day, be it through leisurely exploration or simply savoring the quiet hum of the city awakening, before the rain gently makes its presence known.",
