    "weather_report": "As afternoon unfurls its wings over Subiaco, the celestial sphere remains immaculate, not a cloud in sight to dim the brilliance of the sun. The morning dawned with the promise of a clear sky and the day thus far has held true to such a promise. The clarity of the day, an azure blanket, is picture-perfect for those photographers out there, with no errant cloud muddying the stark sapphire beauty above.\n\nThe kiss of the sun on the skin holds a gentle warmth, suggesting the UV index hovers at a comfortable measure, needing little more than a light sweater to brave the outdoors comfortably. It is a day to luxuriate in the radiant light. To take a stroll through the lanes of Subiaco perhaps, cherishing the humdrum of daily life wrapped in the golden glow of the sun. One may even opt to settle down under a tree with a cherished book to the song of chirping birds. And now, to greet the oncoming evening, a steaming cup of tea in hand, reminisce of the day spent under the benevolent watch of the sun.",
