    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco arrives under a polished, open sky, the sun tilting west with a clean, honeyed light. It has been a bright, untroubled day and will stay that way into evening, the heavens mostly flawless from late afternoon through night. Earlier the sun would have bitten a little; the UV was strong around midday, but it\u2019s easing now, slipping toward low as the sky softens and the shadows lengthen. Visibility is sharp and generous, the kind of clarity that makes colors feel freshly painted.\n\nIt looks pleasantly simple: warm enough for comfort before dusk, then a gentle coolness gathering after dark. Wear light, breathable layers; if you\u2019re still out before sunset, a hat and sunglasses will feel sensible, and a light jacket will earn its keep on the walk home. Good hours for unhurried errands on foot, watering the garden, a quiet spin on the bike, or a book on the balcony while the light mellows. Dinner outdoors would suit, or a small loop around the block to watch the sky trade gold for blue.",
