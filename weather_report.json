    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning shows promise with a mostly sunny disposition, the city bathed in gentle light as temperatures hover in the inviting realm of the upper 50s. The south wind stirs lazily, offering a soft caress against the skin, encouraging an air of casual exploration. However, as the hours wear on, a shift looms on the horizon; clouds will gradually blanket the sky, and by evening, the city will embrace a drizzle, heralding a change that invites a cozy retreat indoors.\n\nThe air remains crisp, with the fog conspicuously retreating for now, revealing the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge against a clear backdrop. Yet, as dusk approaches, the marine layer will creep back, unfurling like a familiar blanket, misting the edges of the Bay and softening the contours of the cityscape. Given this transition, a sensible attire might include layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the coolness of the late afternoon and an umbrella for the evening drizzle. \n\nFor those seeking an escape into the afternoon, a leisurely stroll to the waterfront could reveal delightful scenery and invigorating views. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 might offer a warm nook to sip something comforting as the day drifts into evening. With nature\u2019s subtle shifts in character, one can savor the peaceful cadence of San Francisco\u2019s unique charm today.",
