    "weather_report": "Subiaco spends the late afternoon under a frank, unblemished blue\u2014clear since morning, clear still now. The sun has been fierce and generous, the light crisp and unfiltered; UV ran very high through midday and still has bite even as the shadows lengthen, softening toward a honeyed evening. The air feels clean and dry, the view high-definition, every edge etched by brightness. Expect the rest of the day to stay dry and cloudless, easing into a mellow sunset that takes the glare down to a comfortable glow.\n\nDress for light and heat: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, dark sunglasses, sunscreen you can trust, and water within reach. For these hours, choose the easy errands\u2014wander the shopfronts under the awnings, a short amble through the quiet streets, or a book on a shaded balcony while the light gentles. Save the garden for after the sun dips; let laundry catch the last warm breeze; take a slow lap of the oval or collect dinner on foot, letting the day exhale around you.",
