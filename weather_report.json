    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts through midday under a soft, changeable sky, the light a little muted and the breeze easy on the skin. Expect a brief, well-mannered shower to wander through mid-afternoon, washing the streets and sharpening the view, before the day clears toward a gentler, sunnier late afternoon with only a few clouds for company. Sun strength around lunch still has a bit of bite, but the UV will ease as the afternoon lengthens, and the air should feel clean and calm once the sprinkle moves on.\n\nLight layers will suit the mood: a breathable shirt, something with sleeves for the breeze, and a compact rain jacket or umbrella for that passing shower; sunglasses will serve you well when the sky opens up later. It looks like a day for errands by foot between patches of sun, a coffee under an awning while the shower ticks by, then a short amble through a bookshop or a quiet gallery. As the clouds lift, take a relaxed walk through a leafy street or sit on a balcony and let the late light do its restorative work.",
