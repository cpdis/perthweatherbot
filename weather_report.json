    "weather_report": "In the quiet pre-dawn hours of Subiaco, the horizon holds the promise of an immaculate day. With a sky that was unwaveringly clear hours before and steadfastly remains so, today unfolds with a promise of boundless brightness. As the sun inches its way up the sky, it will bathe the city with a golden glow, with not a wisp of cloud to contest its reign. While there's no explicit mention of the UV index in the forecast, a mercilessly bright sun often denotes a strong UV presence, urging those who venture outside to wield sunscreen like a shield. As the early morning mist begins to dissolve, one can almost feel the anticipation of a day drenched in sunlight, both a balm and a keen reminder of summer's embrace. \n\nGiven these crystalline conditions, today asks for comfort through light, breathable fabrics, perhaps a wide-brimmed hat or a pair of gentle sunglasses\u2013trusted companions in greeting such a dazzling sky. With the morning still fresh, a leisurely stroll through the city\u2019s verdant parks or a quiet corner cafe to savor a foamy cappuccino seems fitting, perfectly timed before the sun reaches its zenith and the air buzzes with its full intensity. As the day unfurls in its serene clarity, one might steal away to a shaded nook with a well-thumbed book, or leisurely bask in the sun's warmth\u2013testaments to the day's abundant tranquility. Subiaco invites you to embrace this luminous day, an opportunity to pause and delight in the simplest of pleasures.",
