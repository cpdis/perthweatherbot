With an overnight low circling around the chilly confines of 44 degrees, it\u2019s advisable to don layers, perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable sweater, to stave off the night\u2019s crisp embrace while wandering the quiet streets.\n\nCome Sunday morning, the sun will rise to a mostly sunny disposition, illuminating the city with a muted brilliance that accentuates its iconic silhouette. The high will flirt with the mid-fifties, with a cooling trend toward the afternoon, reminiscent of how the Golden Gate Bridge emerges from the mist\u2014an elegant reminder of this city\u2019s capricious relationship with the fog. A gentle breeze from the northwest will provide a refreshing touch as the day unfolds, making for a pleasant opportunity to explore local cafes or take a stroll along the waterfront, indulging in the serene beauty of a city waking from its slumber. Aim for modest comforts, perhaps a cozy scarf and a hat, to embrace the mild chill that lingers in the air, transforming a simple day into a delightful urban experience.",
