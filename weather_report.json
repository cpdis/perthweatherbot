    "weather_report": "What a beautiful morning it is in Downtown San Francisco, where the sun spills golden light over the skyline, casting long shadows beneath the graceful structures that define this city of hills and dreams. With the forecast promising a sunny day, the current clarity hints at a joyful anticipation of warmth, as temperatures will gently descend from a pleasant high of 61 to a cooler 57 as the afternoon unfolds. A light northeast breeze stirs, weaving through the streets and curling around the corners, perfect for a morning stroll or cafe exploration, just as the city wakes from its slumber.\n\nAs for the evening, expect clear skies to envelop the city, inviting you to enjoy a chilly yet crisp night. With temperatures dropping to around 47, it would be wise to don something warmer\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater or a light jacket, wrapped around you as you savor a warm drink. The absence of fog means that the iconic vistas of the Golden Gate and the hills beyond are laid bare, beckoning one to take a moment to behold the artistry of nature and architecture in harmony. Today would be an excellent opportunity to navigate the charming streets on foot, perhaps visiting a local gallery or watching the water glisten under the sun\u2019s tender gaze, before finding a quiet spot to ponder over the day.",
