    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Netley, the last of the night\u2019s light rain has tapered to a hush, leaving pavements dark and glistening. The sky wears a soft pewter lid, the horizon a smudge, and the air carries a gentle salt note off the water. Sunshine will be shy early; UV is very low at this hour, with only a dim hint of brightness behind the cloud.\n\nThrough the day, expect a mostly overcast, gently changeable sky, with the chance of a brief shower but also pockets of milky light pushing through. If those brighter spells arrive, the UV will lift to the low-to-moderate side for a time; otherwise it stays low and the day reads as muted rather than harsh. Dress in light layers with a thin waterproof or a trench, shoes that won\u2019t mind damp pavements, and keep a small umbrella handy. It\u2019s a good morning for a quiet walk to the bakery, an unhurried commute, or a bit of tidying and letter-writing by a window; if the clouds thin later, take a lingering loop along the shore and let the air clear your head.",
