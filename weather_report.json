    "weather_report": "As the clock edges closer to afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the landscape is painted with a gentle mix of sunlight and clouds, the type of weather that teases the senses. Currently, you may catch glimpses of sunshine breaking through, yet there\u2019s an unmistakable restlessness in the air, hinting at the rain that will arrive later this evening. Clouds gather in the distance, especially towards the west, where the marine layer hangs like a soft veil, hinting at the moisture to come. This afternoon is expected to be mild, with temperatures tapering off into the cooler embrace of the evening.\n\nWith a predicted high around 62 degrees, the weather invites you to dress with layers; a light sweater or jacket is advisable for when that cool wind picks up. As you prepare for the evening, expect the rain to begin just after work hours, transforming the evening vibe into something cozy and introspective. Consider a casual wander through nearby shops or perhaps settling down with a warm drink in a cafe, as the sound of raindrops begins to percussion gently against the windows. The city holds a certain charm on days like this, where the promise of rain offers a contemplative backdrop to the hum of urban life.",
