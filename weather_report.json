    "weather_report": "The afternoon air in Downtown San Francisco carries a crisp clarity, with the sun casting a gentle warmth that breaks through the coolness typical of the season. Temperatures hover in the mid-fifties, a pleasant contrast to the chill that will settle in tonight. A light northwesterly breeze whispers through the streets, stirring the leaves and promising a clear evening ahead as temperatures dip to around 42, edging slightly upwards overnight. \n\nCurrently, the marine layer has receded, leaving the skyline sharp against the azure stretch of sky\u2014no fog to obscure the majestic views of the bridges and cityscape. It is an ideal moment for a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit where one can savor a warm cup while watching the world meander by. Dressing in layers is wise; a light jacket over a warm sweater will provide comfort as the night draws near, and the cool air invites a cozy embrace as one moves through the lively streets. Embrace this rare delightful weather; there\u2019s a certain enchantment in a clear San Francisco evening that invites exploration and connection.",
