    "weather_report": "Morning in West Perth opens under a lacquered blue, the sun already keen and without a veil. The air is dry and clean, visibility crisp; by late morning into early afternoon the light will sharpen rather than soften, with very high UV under a cloudless sky. It reads as a simple day, bright and uncomplicated, pleasant in the shade and a touch unforgiving in the open as the heat gathers.\n\nLight, breathable clothes suit it best; a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a generous run of sunscreen are not ornaments today but armor, and a bottle of water belongs in the bag. Make the most of the late morning for errands on foot or a brief stroll for coffee before the glare peaks; consider a quiet lunch tucked under a verandah or in a leafy courtyard, and let the early afternoon be for indoor tasks, a gallery wander, or reading in a pool of shade. If you feel like moving, take an easy loop through the neighborhood, keeping to the trees and the gentler light.",
