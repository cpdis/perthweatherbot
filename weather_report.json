    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning greets us with a soft drizzle that dances lightly on the streets, painting them in sheen as the clouds brood overhead. The forecast hints at further showers until late afternoon, before the promise of a more temperate, partly sunny interlude perhaps begins to pierce through the gray. As the temperature creeps into the mid-fifties, it\u2019s wise to layer up\u2014think a cozy sweater beneath a water-resistant jacket, paired with comfortable footwear that can endure unexpected puddles. \n\nAmidst the rain, the iconic cityscape may appear cloaked in a veil of mist, with the heights of Sutro Tower casting its gaze over a scene that straddles between mysterious allure and the chill of winter. As the day unfolds, the winds from the west will continue to rustle at 9 to 15 mph, lending a briskness to the air that sharpens the senses. After the rain subsides, those brave enough to venture out may find solace in a quiet coffee shop, where the ambience mingles with the rich aroma of roasting beans. Alternatively, a walk along the Embarcadero could provide culinary delights from local vendors, where the flavors of the season lift spirits beneath a skyline that whispers tales of resilience.",
