    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a calm, glassy sky and a gentle hush to the streets. The forecast keeps things clear through the night, so stars should have their say. The sun is no longer a factor; UV concerns are gone until morning, and the air reads clean and uncomplicated, the kind that sharpens distant lights and softens edges. It feels like a simple, pleasant night rather than a dramatic one.\n\nDress for ease: short sleeves if you\u2019re still warm from the day, a light layer in hand if a stray breeze finds you. It\u2019s a good time for an unhurried stroll to clear your head, a quiet errand run, or a small ritual on the balcony with a book or a glass of water. If you\u2019ve been indoors, step out and look up; the sky is unobstructed and honest, the sort that makes plans seem unnecessary.",
