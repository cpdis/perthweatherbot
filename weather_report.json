    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the night has settled into a calm, inky blue with only a few stray clouds adrift. The air feels clean and unhurried; visibility is clear and the streets are hushed. Through the small hours the sky should stay mostly open, which bodes for a bright, uncomplicated sunrise and a day that tilts sunny. The UV is negligible now, then wakes quickly after first light; by late morning, shade and sunscreen become wise companions.\n\nWear a light layer or soft sweater for the night\u2019s edge, trading it for something breathable and a hat once the day gathers. It\u2019s a good hour for finishing a chapter, folding laundry, or setting coffee to steep for the morning; early risers might enjoy a quiet walk before the city yawns awake. Expect a clear-headed day suited to small errands, a gentle ride to the shops, or a few unhurried minutes with the garden and the birds.",
