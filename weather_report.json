    "weather_report": "A muted morning settles over Rottnest, the sky a soft pewter and the sea brushed with a gentle sheen. Light showers look likely to drift in by late morning, then ease toward a patchwork of cloud through the afternoon, when the sun may slip through in shy, silvered bursts. Visibility stays decent, the air washed and clean after the passing spits of rain. Even with the cloud, the spring sun still has a bit of bite when it shows, so expect a moderate UV pulse during brighter spells.\n\nDress for a changeable day: a light layer with a thin rain shell, comfortable shoes that don\u2019t mind damp paths, a cap and a touch of sunscreen for the clearer patches. It\u2019s a good morning for an unhurried coffee near Thomson Bay, then a leisurely cycle between salt lakes while the showers taper off, pausing to watch the water turn from slate to turquoise as the light improves. Later, explore the museum or find a sheltered nook by a limestone wall with a book; if the sun peeks out, a short wander along the shoreline will feel unexpectedly kind.",
