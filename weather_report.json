    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a gentle shroud of clouds, with temperatures dipping to a cool 49, inviting a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater for those venturing out. The quietude of the evening, punctuated only by a whisper of a southward breeze, lends an air of calm to the cityscape, where the night's stillness holds promises of a new day. Come Tuesday, the horizon brightens as mostly sunny skies emerge, albeit with the temperatures easing down to around 56 by afternoon, suggesting a crisp clarity that may evoke a brisk wander through the neighborhoods. \n\nWhile fog may gently kiss the edges of the bridge and the bay, this marine layer will likely retreat, revealing the sunny disposition that the day promises. As the urban scene unfolds, it's an ideal time to indulge in a stroll along the waterfront, or perhaps to find a quiet caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink while observing the tapestry of life that makes this city so vibrant. As you step out, lean into the layered approach to dressing\u2014comfortable shoes, a light jacket, and a genuine smile for whatever the day brings.",
