    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crispness hinting at the impending rainfall that is set to arrive shortly after 10 PM. The sky, once mostly sunny, now wears a cloak of cloudiness, layered in shades of gray that speak to the moisture gathering in the atmosphere. The temperature, a cool whisper of 51 degrees, will see a slight rise as the night deepens, while the south-southeast wind stirs subtly, rustling through the streets at 7 to 10 mph.\n\nVisibility is diminishing, with the earlier clarity giving way to veils of haze that hint at the presence of the marine layer, suggestive of a damp chill lurking in the air. As the rain approaches, the promise of it unfurls like a familiar melody, hinting at new rainfall amounts gently falling between a tenth and quarter of an inch. For those venturing out, layers are advisable; a warm, lightweight jacket will shield against the evening coolness while being light enough to accommodate the shifting temperatures. Perhaps an evening stroll along the waterfront, where the rhythm of the waves meets the soft glow of street lamps, would beckon one to reflect and unwind on this transitioning day.",
