    "weather_report": "Perth lounges under a flawless sky this late afternoon, the light bright and honest, edges crisp enough to make the hills look freshly minted. The day has been a sun-forward one, and though the sting is easing now, the UV is still assertive until the sun slides lower; by evening the clarity will hold and the air will feel gentler, the sky rinsing itself from gold to indigo without a stitch of cloud to snag it.\n\nDress for ease and reflection: breathable layers, a hat and sunglasses if you\u2019re out before sunset, then a light top for the cooler turn after dark. It\u2019s a pleasant hour for ordinary errands done on foot, a quiet roll on the bike to the shops, watering the garden while the heat lifts, or sitting with a book on the balcony to watch the color leave the day. With the air this clear and untroubled, small plans feel elegant enough.",
