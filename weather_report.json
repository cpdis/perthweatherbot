    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a quiet, rain-brushed dawn, the streets rinsed dark and the sky sealed in soft grey. Light rain is set to visit around first light and into the morning, so sunshine will be shy for a while; the UV sits low at this hour and should stay subdued while the clouds hold, only sharpening later if they thin. The day begins muted and contemplative rather than crystalline, edges softened by drizzle and the occasional hiss of tyres on wet pavement.\n\nDress for a cool, damp start: a light waterproof or hooded layer and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. Let the morning unroll gently\u2014wait out the passing showers with a slow coffee by a window, sort a few errands under awnings once shops stir, or put in a tidy hour at the desk while the rain keeps its patient tempo. If the rain slackens, take a brief wander beneath the trees to breathe the petrichor and then return to the day\u2019s small, steady work. Later possibilities depend on the sky, so keep plans flexible and the jacket near.",
