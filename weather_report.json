    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco wears a clean, enamel-blue sky. The sun is tilting toward the rooftops and the light has turned honeyed, shadows sharpening on the pavement. It\u2019s a clear, dry-feeling day with excellent visibility and no real hint of cloud; the forecast stays cloudless through sunset and into the evening. The sting of the sun is easing now, though earlier it would have been strong for spring, so if you\u2019re lingering outdoors before dusk a hat and sunglasses still make sense.\n\nIt feels pleasantly simple: short sleeves are comfortable for the next hour or so, with a light layer handy for the quick cool-down after dark. This is weather for unhurried errands and small pleasures\u2014airing the house, watering the pots, a slow loop around the block, or cycling to pick up something for supper. As twilight slips in under a clear dome, the night should be calm and inviting, perfect for a last cup of tea on the porch and a look at the first stars.",
