    "weather_report": "Katy settles under a low, unbroken lid of cloud this evening, the moon and stars politely excused. The night looks muted and steady rather than stormy, a gray hush that should hold through the late hours. Sunshine won\u2019t factor in; expect no bright breaks, and a UV index that is essentially nil until day returns. Clarity is serviceable despite the ceiling\u2014edges softened, colors desaturated, the kind of sky that makes streetlights feel warmer than they are. It\u2019s the sort of night that\u2019s more gentle than thrilling, a little dreary but calm.\n\nDress for coziness and small comforts: a light layer or sweater, something with pockets, comfortable shoes for a short stroll if you need one last loop around the block. The weather suits simple, ordinary rituals\u2014tidying the kitchen, catching up on a chapter under a good lamp, prepping tomorrow\u2019s lunch, or an unhurried grocery run while the parking lot is quiet. If morning arrives with the same quilt of clouds, expect a slow, gray start and soft light rather than sparkle.",
