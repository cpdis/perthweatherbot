    "weather_report": "As the night in Downtown San Francisco stretches on, the air is heavy with the promise of rain\u2014a soft patter against city streets rendered slick and reflective under the muted glow of streetlights. The clouds hang low, shrouding the Golden Gate in a ghostly veil, lending an ethereal quality to the surroundings. With the temperature resting comfortably in the upper fifties, a light jacket or a cozy sweater offers enough warmth against the brisk winds that whistle through the avenues, caressed by gusts from the south. \n\nCome morning, the rain will continue to blanket the city, transforming it into a picture painted in shades of gray and muted greens. Expect a steady downpour throughout the day, inviting thoughts of warm drinks and sheltered corners. The allure of indoor activities beckons: perhaps a stroll through the Museum of Modern Art, where time can be forgotten amidst the intrigue of contemporary pieces, or an afternoon spent at a local caf\u00e9, savoring the rich aroma of coffee while gazing out at the rain-soaked streets. Outdoor pursuits would be less accommodating; the curtain of moisture will envelop the city, washing away the clarity of the skyline and making ventures to the waterfront less inviting. \n\nAs the day unfolds, dressing in layers is wise, with a waterproof outer layer recommended for those feeling adventurous. The marine layer might cling to the hills, leaving a misty outline of the Bay Area, as if reminding us of the beauty found in layers of mystery and rain. Seek refuge in the warmth of the city\u2019s artistic spirit and enjoy the rain-drenched charm of a San Francisco day.",
