    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a pale lid of cloud, the morning light softened and a hint of rain working its way in toward late morning. Expect a brief spell of light showers around lunchtime before the sky loosens into broken cloud through the afternoon, offering occasional, silvery sun. It won\u2019t be a sun-soaked day; the brightness will come in shy, filtered flashes, and the UV looks moderate at midday even with the cloud, the sort that nips if you linger. The air should feel clean after the passing damp, with views a touch muted at first and clearer later when the cloud frays.\n\nDress in easy layers with a light rain shell and closed shoes; carry a small umbrella and, if you\u2019ll be out around noon, a dab of sunscreen and sunglasses for those brighter breaks. It\u2019s a good day for a coffee run and a tidy loop of errands before the shower, a quiet hour in the library while the pavement darkens, then a short wander or bike ride once the afternoon opens up. If you\u2019ve herbs on the balcony, the soil will be forgiving for a quick prune after the rain.",
