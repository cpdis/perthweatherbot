    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cloud cover hangs in the air, lending a soft, muted glow to the city\u2019s lights that twinkle like scattered stars. The chill of the evening settles in, with temperatures dipping to around fifty, accompanied by a subtle northwest breeze that whispers through the streets. The fog, typical of this coastal realm, has not yet slipped into the night, leaving a sense of clarity that invites you to step outside and breathe in the cool, crisp air. \n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, expect the sun to emerge triumphantly, casting light on the city with its rays shimmering against the bay. Highs near sixty-one will slowly transition to a cooler fifty-seven, perfect weather for an afternoon stroll or a leisurely visit to one of the local cafes. Given the pleasant conditions, a light jacket or sweater would suffice, making way for easy movement through the city, whether you choose to wander along the Embarcadero or lose yourself in the charm of the Mission District. Catch a few moments on a sunny terrace, perhaps with a fresh cup of coffee, as life unfolds slowly and beautifully around you.",
