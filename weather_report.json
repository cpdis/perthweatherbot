    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a kindly scatter of clouds at midday, the sun still the main actor, shouldering through in generous flashes. Expect the afternoon to hold this pattern: bright intervals, a few drifting veils, long horizons and clear views. It will feel like honest late-spring weather\u2014open, sunlit, and a touch relentless on bare skin. The UV will be harsh around the early afternoon, as it so often is here this time of year; seek shade when you can and treat sunscreen, sunglasses, and a brimmed hat as part of the uniform.\n\nDress light and breathable, with something to throw over your shoulders if you\u2019re lingering outdoors. This looks like a day for simple errands on foot between patches of shade, a quiet coffee under an awning, or a quick visit to a gallery while the sun is sharpest. As the light softens toward late afternoon, a gentle stroll along the river or a small round of gardening will feel right, the clouds still scattered and the heat easing just enough to invite unhurried company.",
