    "weather_report": "Houston wakes under a quilt of soft gray, the heavy night blanket having loosened into broken cloud. The sun is mostly a rumor behind the deck, offering a muted, pearly light and a gentle, low UV that won\u2019t bite. The day\u2019s outlines appear softened at the edges, the city quieter in tone, with no glare, just a calm, even brightness that makes colors look honest.\n\nExpect the clouds to loiter and thin in places as the morning opens up, with shy glimpses of blue rather than any grand clearing. It looks like a pleasant, unhurried sort of day: comfortable in light layers\u2014a long-sleeve shirt or a thin sweater, a packable jacket if you run cool\u2014and sunglasses only if you\u2019re sensitive to brightness. It\u2019s a good morning for easy errands, a slow neighborhood walk to listen to the birds working the treetops, lingering over coffee by a window, or browsing a bookstore where the light falls in silvery panes. If the sun does slip through, it will feel brief and kind.",
