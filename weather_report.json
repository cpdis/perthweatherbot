    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds beneath a veil of clouds, hinting at the rain that will soon wash over the city. The air is tinged with a coolness, and a gentle breeze stirs through the streets, imparting a quiet sense of anticipation. As the temperatures hover in the low 60s, it feels more like a breath of autumn than the cusp of winter. The promise of rain whispers through the canopy of gray above, with an 80% chance of showers expected this evening. Look closely, and one might perceive the softer outlines of landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge shrouded in mist\u2014evidence of the marine layer creeping ever closer.\n\nAs the day progresses, those venturing outside should consider wrapping themselves in layers. A light jacket\u2014preferably waterproof\u2014should serve you well as you navigate the cobblestone streets. The allure of the weather invites a stroll through one of the local museums or perhaps a quiet coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9 where the delicious aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the sound of rain tapping against the window. Such simple pleasures will complement the mood of the day beautifully, offering a brief respite from the impending downpour while allowing you to savor the charm of a San Francisco afternoon.",
