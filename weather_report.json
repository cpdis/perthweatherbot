    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a clear, polished evening, the heat of the day already folded away and the sky turning a deep, steady blue. The afternoon was bright and uncomplicated, the kind of clean sunshine that softens as the hours pass; UV would have been moderate earlier but drops to low by dusk and is effectively gone now. Clarity is excellent: no haze, no drama, just a tranquil, starlit ceiling building overhead.\n\nExpect the night to stay dry and cloudless, pleasant if you\u2019re strolling unhurriedly or sitting on a balcony with a light layer over your shoulders. Dress for a gentle cool-down after dark\u2014linen gives way to cotton and a cardigan, sandals to something closed-toe if you linger outside. It\u2019s a good evening for small, ordinary things: a quick loop around the block to clear the head, watering the herbs, airing out a room for a few minutes, or walking a letter to the post box without watching the sky. Tomorrow can wait; the weather is quietly on your side.",
