    "weather_report": "As the afternoon settles in over Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a drab gray drapery of clouds, punctuated by the relentless cadence of rain tapping against windows and sidewalks. The air carries a chill, not quite biting but enough to warrant a warm layer. With the clouds heavy overhead, visibility is diminished, mirroring the persistent drizzle that is expected to intensify. The horizon, traditionally a soft blur of rooftops and bridges, lies obscured, swallowed by fog that lingers close to the ground, particularly near the edges where the bay meets the city. \n\nAs evening approaches, the temperature will gently rise, a subtle irony considering the dampness that permeates the atmosphere. For those venturing out, it would be wise to don waterproof jackets and sturdy shoes, prepared for puddles and the possibility of a sudden gust. The late hours are perfect for curling up with a book at home, perhaps preparing a warm meal or sneaking into a cozy caf\u00e9 to watch the world slosh by through rain-streaked windows. Outdoor activities might take a backseat today; instead, embrace the moments of quiet that this weather lends, the kind that invites reflection and comfort amid the challenging conditions.",
