    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean, untroubled sky, the kind of pre-dawn clarity that makes the air feel crisp and honest. As the light edges in, expect a bright, blue morning with excellent visibility and a quick rise in warmth once the sun clears the rooftops. UV will surge through the morning, the sort that sneaks up on you, so treat the sun with respect even if the breeze is gentle. It looks like a pleasing day to be out early, and a squinting, high-glare one by late morning.\n\nDress for a cool start and a sunny swing upward: a light layer you can shed, breathable clothes, sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen. Good hours now for a quiet walk with a takeaway coffee, watering the garden before the heat, or a ride to work while the streets are still yawning awake. Later, shade and unhurried indoor tasks will be kinder; open a window, let the bright air in, and pace the day to the light.",
