    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Subiaco, the sky feels rinsed and quiet, the kind of clear that makes the few night sounds carry a little farther. The pre-dawn hours look clean and cloudless, a gentle chill lingering until first light. As the sun climbs, expect a bright, transparent day with crisp edges and honest shadows; sunshine will be abundant, and the UV will climb quickly by late morning, so treat it with respect even in early spring. It should feel pleasant overall, cool to mild early, warming with the day, and visibility sharp enough to make colors pop.\n\nDress in light layers now\u2014a soft jumper or light jacket\u2014and trade down to short sleeves by mid-morning, adding a hat, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen for errands or a stroll. If you\u2019re awake, this is a good hour for a quiet cup on the porch or a chapter by an open window; at first light, a short walk, a spin to the shops, or hanging the washing early will fit the weather, with a shaded lunch later when the sun grows insistent.",
