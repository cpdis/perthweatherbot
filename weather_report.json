    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco opens under a soft grey lid, the air freshly rinsed and streets darkened to graphite. Light showers drift through the day, most likely around the middle hours, with sunshine confined to brief, silvery gaps rather than any steady warmth; UV should stay mostly subdued under cloud, though a midday bright spell could still warrant a dab of sunscreen if you linger outdoors. The light is gentle and a little murky, views slightly blurred by passing veils of rain, making the day feel quiet and unhurried. Dress for comfort and interruption: a light waterproof, easy layers, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and a compact umbrella. It\u2019s a good morning for a slow coffee under an awning, a browse through the bookshop or gallery, or running small errands between showers; at home, crack a window to the smell of wet pavement and let the day find you.",
