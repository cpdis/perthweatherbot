    "weather_report": "The morning unveils a mixture of heavy clouds draping over Downtown San Francisco, weaving a narrative of impending rain. As the clock ticks toward the afternoon, the crisp air turns noticeably colder, promising a descent in temperature to the low fifties. This cloudy canvas hints at the rain that is likely to arrive after four, yet for now, the city glimmers under the soft white of the clouds, the Golden Gate Bridge barely visible in the backdrop, despite the tenuous sun making its efforts known. The breeze carries a gentle chill, instilling a sense of quietude as the southeast winds whisper their way through the streets.\n\nAs the day progresses, one might consider dressing in layers, perhaps a warm sweater paired with a light waterproof jacket\u2014perfect for those soon-to-come drizzles. A stroll through the quieter streets, enjoying a newly opened caf\u00e9 or delving into a book at a cozy library, feels just right in such weather. While the persistent clouds and the anticipated rain may suggest a day spent indoors, the charm of the city lies in making the most of its rhythms, perhaps indulging in the aroma of freshly brewed coffee or losing oneself in the pages of an engaging story, allowing the soft patter of rain to be the perfect backdrop for a day well spent.",
