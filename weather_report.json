    "weather_report": "As the afternoon settles over Subiaco, the sky drapes itself in a subtle tapestry of scattered and few clouds, offering delicate wisps against a backdrop of gentle blues. The sun, though veiled at times, intermittently sends its warm embrace, casting a reassuring glow across the landscape. The UV index should hover at moderate levels, beckoning you to bask in this blend of light and shadow but reminding you to seek shelter under a wide-brimmed hat or to sport a pair of stylish sunglasses. It's a day that inspires quiet reflection outdoors, where each rustle of leaves whispers stories of windswept travels. The air is mild, making a light jacket or a comfortable sweater an ideal companion, ready to keep away any vagrant breeze that might meander through the nooks of this lively afternoon. An amiable aura washes over the day, encouraging a leisurely stroll down tree-lined streets or perhaps a visit to a quaint outdoor cafe, where one might indulge in the simple pleasure of a well-pressed coffee or a fragrant tea. It is an afternoon to languish in the ordinary, allowing the gentle pulse of life to unfold at its own unhurried pace, inviting you to observe the beauty in every fleeting moment.",
