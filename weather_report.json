    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, the skyline stands clear against a tranquil backdrop, the moonlight revealing the contours of the city in shimmering silver. With temperatures dipping to a cool embrace, currently around 49 degrees, the air is crisp, and a gentle north northwest breeze whispers through the streets. The forecast for tomorrow promises sunny skies, a welcome transition into warmer daylight, with temperatures nudging the mid-sixties before gently falling as the day unfolds. \n\nTonight's clarity invites contemplative strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment at a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a hot beverage can soften the evening chill. As you venture out, layers are your best companion; a light jacket or a stylish sweater paired with comfortable trousers will keep the cool at bay. While there\u2019s no haze or marine layer to obscure the view, the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge stands proud against the night sky, beckoning the intrepid to explore. Embrace the beauty of this serene evening and seize the opportunity for understated adventures amid the city's charm.",
