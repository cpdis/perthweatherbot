    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, a gentle veil of clouds lingers over the city, hinting at the shifts to come. The air holds a mildness, whispering of the rain expected to arrive as the day matures. Currently, there\u2019s a mix of sunlight and cloud cover\u2014a delicate interplay of clarity and obscure hues. As the sun struggles against the encroaching clouds, it casts a soft glow over the streets, with temperatures hovering comfortably around the mid-sixties before gradually retreating.\n\nAs the hours slip by, the forecast predicts rain will unfurl its curtain after 5 PM, so consider carrying an umbrella on your afternoon stroll. The haze may limit long-distance views across the bay, but your local cafes beckon warmly, perfect for indulging in a delicious pastry while watching the world meander by. With the potential for drizzle tonight, layer up lightly, perhaps with a light jacket to shield against the evening chill as the temperature cools to the low fifties. Let the rhythm of this day guide you toward cozy conversations and moments of quiet reflection, all under the shifting skies of this splendid city.",
