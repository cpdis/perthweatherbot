    "weather_report": "Before sunrise, Swanbourne sits under a ragged ceiling of broken cloud, the light faint and pewtery, the village quiet as a held breath. Little in the way of direct sunshine is on offer, with only passing chinks likely once the day gets going; the UV index stays very low. Visibility should be decent, though the world will look softened at the edges, colours muted, more matte than gloss.\n\nExpect a serviceable, mostly dry sort of day: a grey canvas with occasional brighter brushstrokes when the cloud thins. It won\u2019t dazzle, but it won\u2019t bully either. Dress in easy layers\u2014soft knit or fleece under a light jacket\u2014and add a scarf for the early chill. Sensible shoes for damp leaves and pavements will feel right. This is a morning for putting the kettle on, then stepping out after first light for a gentle walk or a quick errand to the shops; later, a short lunchtime loop to catch any shy blue in the sky. Pleasant enough for getting things done, unhurried and ordinary in the best way.",
