    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco is hushed and cool, the sky largely clear and beginning to pale at the edges. It looks to be a clean, glassy morning: sunrise will bring a bright, honest light, and by midmorning a few casual clouds will wander through, softening the glare without stealing the day.\n\nExpect a mostly sunny, dry feel with good visibility and a gentle lift in warmth as the hours move along. UV will rise quickly once the sun is up, so think light layers you can shed, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. It\u2019s a fine morning for a quiet walk before breakfast, a quick bicycle roll to the bakery, or getting the washing on the line while the air is still kind. Later, errands on foot, a coffee under an awning, or a spell of reading in a patch of shade will suit the bright but tempered afternoon. The day looks pleasant rather than punishing: clear enough to feel open, a touch of cloud to take the edge off, and the sort of spring brightness that asks for unhurried plans.",
