    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a sky of remarkable clarity, with the sun illuminating the cityscape in golden hues. Temperatures gently taper off from a high near sixty to a comfortable fifty-eight, accompanied by a light northeast breeze that whispers across the bay, occasionally stirring up playful gusts. The air is crisp and fresh, devoid of the usual fog that cloaks this vibrant metropolis; instead, it offers a rare vantage of the Golden Gate Bridge stretching majestically against the azure sky. \n\nAs evening approaches, the night promises to be equally inviting, with clear conditions allowing for stargazing as the temperature dips to a cozy forty-six. A light southwest wind brushes the air, adding to the serene ambiance of the city, making it an ideal time for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or enjoying an evening cup of coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9. For those venturing outdoors, light layers would suffice, perhaps a light sweater to ward off the cool evening breeze. This day invites a rare opportunity to bask in San Francisco's natural beauty, whether through a quiet walk, a moment of reflection on a park bench, or simply enjoying the fading daylight over the skyline.",
