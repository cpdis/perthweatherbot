Tonight, expect a low around fifty degrees\u2014a chill that hints at the approaching winter, but not so harsh as to overwhelm. The air carries a refreshing crispness, perfect for a quiet stroll along the waterfront, where the distant lights flicker like stars fallen to Earth.\n\nOn Saturday, the sun will awaken the skyline with promises of mostly sunny skies. With temperatures climbing to a comfortable sixty-three, the day will begin with clarity and warmth. However, as the afternoon approaches, expect temperatures to retreat slightly, nudging attendees towards light layers\u2014a sweater or jacket made of something breathable would serve well against the gradual coolness. It\u2019s an ideal day to savor a leisurely brunch at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where patrons can bask in the gentle sunlight before wandering through the vibrant streets adorned with historic charm and modern life. The distinct marine layer that often blankets this region stands down for now, leaving the iconic vistas unapologetically on display.",
