    "weather_report": "As the early hours unfold in Downtown San Francisco, the cool breath of the night lingers, casting a quiet clarity over the skyline. The air remains mostly clear, with hints of the signature chill that inform each step outside. With temperatures expected to settle around a tranquil 50 degrees, the dawn\u2019s embrace heralds a sunny day ahead, albeit one where warmth drifts in modestly, peaking around 63. The gentle north-northeast winds whisper softly at 2 to 6 mph, providing a refreshing contrast to the promise of sunlight.\n\nAs you prepare to greet the day, consider a light layer to ward off the early chill; a cozy sweater or a light jacket may suffice until the sun fully ascends and the air warms. The fog, that ethereal hallmark of coastal mornings, is momentarily absent, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge and distant hills clearly etched against the skyline\u2014an invitation for a stroll along the waterfront or through the vibrant streets of the city. A casual walk through the Presidio or a quiet coffee in one of the local caf\u00e9s provides the perfect backdrop to enjoy the nascent warmth of the day, lending itself to a sense of peace and simplicity, much like the city itself in these serene morning hours.",
