    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, another rainy afternoon unfurls, shrouded under a thick, gray blanket of clouds. The rain drums rhythmically against sidewalks, a persistent companion as it casts a somber yet contemplative mood over the city. The temperature, hovering around the mid-fifties, feels cooler with a sharp, southeast wind gusting through the streets, bringing with it a chill that lingers in the air. Visibility is low, with mist and drizzles obscuring familiar landmarks, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge veiled beyond the horizon. This is not a day for grand views or bustling cafe terraces; instead, cradled corners and soft-lit interiors beckon the hopeful wanderer.\n\nAs evening approaches, the rain is set to continue its relentless cascade, and the low temperatures may catch the unwary. A cozy sweater or layered jacket will provide essential comfort, while waterproof footwear remains a wise choice for traversing puddled sidewalks. The coolness will often give way to a slightly warmer note as night envelops the city, a gentle reminder of the warmth found in shared moments indoors. Today offers an opportunity for quiet reflection\u2014perhaps finding a spot within a favorite bookstore or a local caf\u00e9, where the soothing sounds of rain blend seamlessly with the soft hum of conversation. Embrace the solace found in a warm drink, and let the day unfold at a leisurely pace, as the rain transforms the city into a watercolor dreamscape.",
