    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the world below embraces a shroud of grey, the air crisp and pregnant with moisture. Drizzle dances lightly, a gentle hint of rain to come, while the low-hanging clouds shield the skyline from the soft caress of sunlight. With temperatures hovering around the cool end of the spectrum, the city offers a muted palette of muted tones. The winds whisper an urgent promise, swirling through the streets with gusts that announce the day\u2019s impending deluge.\n\nThe forecast predicts a steady progression from this gentle mist to a full embrace of rain by mid-morning\u2014an invitation for those with a taste for solitude to wander through the cloaked parks or perhaps take refuge in the warmth of a caf\u00e9. A light jacket, perhaps layered over a soft sweater, will provide comfort against the chill and the moisture as you navigate the intersection of urban life and nature's rhythm. It's a day for quiet contemplation, for finding solace among the bustling streets, or for indulging in the simple pleasure of curling up with a good book by the window, where the rain creates a symphony against the glass. Live in the moment; let the charm of the rainy San Francisco envelop you.",
