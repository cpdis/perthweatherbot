    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is clean as glass, the kind of clear that sharpens distant sounds and makes the night feel larger than usual. The forecast keeps it cloudless through the small hours, a quiet procession toward a bright, uncomplicated dawn. It looks like one of those days that begins with a cool nip and then opens into honest sunshine; UV is sleepy now but will wake briskly after sunrise, so plan for shade and sunscreen once the morning warms.\n\nDress in light layers you can shed as the day stretches out: a soft jumper or light jacket for the early chill, breathable clothes beneath, a hat waiting by the door for later. If you\u2019re up, it\u2019s a good hour to set tomorrow\u2019s bag by the door or step onto the balcony for a slow breath of the dry night air; after first light, a gentle walk to the bakery, watering the herbs, or hanging a small wash to catch that early sun would suit the mood of this clear, well-mannered day.",
