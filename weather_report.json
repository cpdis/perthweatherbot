    "weather_report": "As the evening descends on Downtown San Francisco, a somber palette of clouds shrouds the city, hinting at the rain that will soon wash over the streets. The air is thick with an impending dampness, ushered in by southerly winds that whisper through the avenues at a brisk pace. Tonight's forecast anticipates showers, cloaking the landscape in a muted atmosphere with temperatures hovering around a mild 55 degrees. Spotting fog may prove elusive; instead, a soft mist will likely drape over the Golden Gate, blending into the skyline and softening the outlines of the city\u2019s architecture. \n\nAs Sunday dawns, the clouds will linger, repeating their serenade of rain, with precipitation intensifying through the afternoon hours. The high, perched around 59 degrees, will subtly drop as the day progresses, while winds lash against the city\u2019s facades, enforcing their presence with gusts that conspire to ruffle hoods and umbrellas alike. This is a day to dress for the somber weather\u2014a cozy layering of sweaters and waterproof jackets will be your armor against the chill and dampness. Perhaps a coffee shop visit beckons, where the warmth of freshly brewed drinks complements the rhythmic patter of rain against the windows. A walk through the fog-veiled streets, while brisk, can offer a delightful solitude, allowing thoughts to drift like the clouds above.",
