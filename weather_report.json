    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into the small hours with a clean, open sky; the forecast keeps it clear through the deep night, with only a light brush of scattered cloud toward dawn. Expect sunrise to reveal a bright, mostly untroubled day, the kind of sharp spring light that makes colors pop and shadows crisp. Clarity looks good, air on the dry side, and the sun will gather strength quickly after breakfast; the UV index is likely to surge to high levels by late morning, so shade, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen will be your allies. For now, a light layer is enough; by day, breathable fabrics will feel kind, with an extra layer handy if you seek air\u2011conditioned refuge. If you\u2019re awake now, crack a window, read a few quiet pages, or step out for a short, unhurried stroll. After first light, a coffee on the veranda, a brisk walk to the shops, or hanging laundry early makes sense; save longer outdoor chores for the gentler late afternoon.",
