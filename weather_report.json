    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into the small hours beneath a polished, ink-blue sky, and the forecast holds that line through dawn: clear, quiet, and clean-edged. UV is negligible now, of course, but this kind of crystalline night usually blooms into a bright, sun-forward morning, with UV rising quickly once the light arrives; expect a day that feels lucid and open, the sort that sharpens colors and shortens shadows.\n\nFor the moment, a light layer or soft jumper will keep the cool from your shoulders; toward morning, think airy fabrics, sunglasses, and a touch of sunscreen in your pocket for the first errands. It\u2019s a pleasant night to go unhurried: a short, reflective walk, a chapter left half-finished, tomorrow\u2019s coffee ground and ready. At first light, water the garden, take a gentle spin on the bike before the streets warm, or slip out for fresh bread while the sky turns from indigo to pearl.",
