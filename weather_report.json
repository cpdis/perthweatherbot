    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the city rests under a veil of partly cloudy skies, with temperatures gently easing down to a brisk 46 degrees, rising ever so slightly to a cozy 48 as the night deepens. A light breeze from the east southeast brushes past, whispering through quiet streets. As dawn breaks tomorrow, expect a moment's haze softening the morning light, a prelude to a day that promises sunny intervals, inviting a high near 62. Yet, as the afternoon wears on, temperatures will retreat to a cooler 58, tempered by a northeast wind that may gust lightly, caressing the skin with a refreshing touch.\n\nGiven these conditions, the evening calls for a comfortable layering strategy, perhaps a warm sweater or light jacket to ward off the chill while strolling through the neighborhoods. Should you awaken to haze, don't let it deter you; the sun will break through, offering a perfect opportunity for a midday walk by the waterfront or a leisurely lunch at a local caf\u00e9, where the warm sun mingles with the gentle breeze. This simple day in San Francisco invites you to explore, to savor the quiet beauty coaxed from a city that thrives in the embrace of both fog and sun.",
