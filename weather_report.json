    "weather_report": "Midnight settles over Albany with a quiet lid of cloud, the thick sheet from late afternoon now torn into softer, broken patches. The night feels muted and gentle, not bright, the sort of sky that keeps the streetlights haloed and the corners of the block calm. Sunshine is out of the picture until morning, and the UV index is effectively nil at this hour; clarity is steady but subdued under the lingering deck.\n\nToward daybreak, expect that muted tone to hang on, with the sun playing shy behind passing gaps. Any sunshine will likely arrive filtered and brief at first; the UV index should stay low through the morning, nudging up only if those breaks widen later. Plan simple comforts: a light layer or soft sweater, something you can peel off if the sky brightens, and comfortable shoes for a short stroll when the neighborhood is still yawning awake. This looks like a day for easy errands, a window seat and a slow cup, a tidy-up of the desk, perhaps a small loop around the block to catch whatever pale light sifts through. Measured, unhurried, and fine in its own modest way.",
