    "weather_report": "This morning in Downtown San Francisco, a thick tapestry of clouds blankets the sky, hinting at the rain that has begun to fall, softening the edges of the city and shrouding the iconic landmarks in a muted, gray light. The air, heavy with moisture, carries a crispness that signals the presence of a marine layer creeping in from the ocean, clouding vision and muffling sounds. As the temperatures slowly dip throughout the day, moving from a moderately breezy 59 to a cooler 57, the persistent rain will likely accompany you outdoors, making the need for an umbrella or a waterproof jacket indispensable.\n\nOnce the sun sets, the drizzle will continue, keeping the atmosphere rich with the scent of wet earth and fog. Tonight promises a low around 54, where gusts of wind whisper through the streets, giving a nudge to the droplets that dance upon pavements. It is a day best suited for quiet indoor pursuits; perhaps a stroll through the local galleries or finding refuge in a warm caf\u00e9, indulging in a book while watching the rain streak the windowpanes. If you're feeling more adventurous, consider a visit to the local libraries, where the quiet ambiance pairs perfectly with the rhythmic sound of rain. Dress warmly in layers, slipping on a cozy sweater beneath your waterproof jacket, and step out to engage with the city as it wraps itself in its cozy, mist-laden embrace.",
