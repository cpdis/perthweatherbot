    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the scent of rain hangs heavily in the air, a promise unfulfilled as the clouds thicken and drench the city in a fresh chill. Pouring before nightfall, showers and the faint rumble of distant thunder make the streets glisten beneath the dim light, while gusts swirl with a brisk energy that rustle leaves and scatter the last remnants of the day\u2019s warmth. The evening air cools to a low of around 44 degrees, sharpening the corners of buildings and deepening shadows; temperatures will embrace slightly warmer tones overnight. \n\nTomorrow, a sense of hope emerges as rain gives way to sunshine. The forecast hints at a delicate dance of clouds yielding to golden rays, a slight chance of morning drizzle giving the city a chance to dry off and breathe. As the day unfolds, temperatures will peak with quiet confidence near 54 degrees before slipping gently back into the cool embrace of afternoon. For those headed outside, dressing in layers will offer comfort against the lingering bite of winter, with a sturdy coat and perhaps a touch of brightness to ward off the gray. Take a quiet stroll through the streets or nestle into a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink and the serene moments of the afternoon, as San Francisco sheds its rain-soaked veil for just a while.",
