    "weather_report": "Fremantle wakes under a hard, generous blue, the kind that leaves no place for cloud to hide. The morning sun is already bright and intent, sharpening edges and pulling color from the sea; by late morning into early afternoon it will be unrelenting. Expect a clear, dry day with excellent visibility and that polished, salt-tinged light the port knows so well. UV will be very high to extreme around midday under these pristine skies, so think shade when you can and armor up when you can\u2019t: sunscreen, sunglasses, a brim, and a light long-sleeve you won\u2019t mind wearing.\n\nDress for bright warmth rather than heat\u2014breathable fabrics and comfortable shoes\u2014and carry water. With the day this clear, small, ordinary plans will sing: a short errand on the bike before noon, coffee under an awning, laundry that will dry in a blink, a quiet wander beneath the fig trees on the Esplanade. If the beach calls, save the swim for later when the sun softens and the light goes honeyed; for now, let the morning be about easy movement and cool shade, windows open to let the sea air thread the rooms.",
