    "weather_report": "As night envelops downtown San Francisco, a curtain of partial clouds dances across the sky, bringing a respite from the day's lingering chill. The air is crisp, holding a low temperature of around 43 degrees, making it wise to don a light jacket or a cozy sweater when stepping outside. A gentle north-northeast breeze, barely rustling the leaves, carries a hint of the ocean's salty embrace, reminding one of the proximity to the bay.\n\nTomorrow promises a sun-kissed awakening, where the city will bask in glorious rays, though temperatures will gracefully descend from the morning high of 61 to a manageable 57 by afternoon. This shift creates the perfect backdrop for leisurely ambling\u2014perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the reflections of sunshine dance in the water, or an engaging visit to one of the local cafes, where the warmth of coffee perfectly complements the brightening day. It's an invitation to savor simplicity in a city rich with moments waiting to unfold, free from the constraints of fog, allowing for a clarity that inspires adventure without excessive layers.",
