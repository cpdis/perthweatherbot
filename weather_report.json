    "weather_report": "Katy wakes under a smooth gray lid, the light already diffused and gentle, the kind that erases hard edges and quiets the pace of the street. The forecast keeps the clouds stitched in place through afternoon and early evening, so don\u2019t expect sun breaks; the UV index will stay low and the day will feel calm rather than bright. Visibility should be fine, but the colors of the world will be softened, like a photograph left slightly underexposed. It looks like a steady, uneventful sky\u2014good weather for getting things done without glare or heat.\n\nLean into easy layers: long sleeves with a light jacket or cardigan you can shrug off indoors, and skip the sunglasses. This is an errand day and a library day, a return-the-holiday-packages day, a tidy-the-desk-and-clear-the-inbox day. Take a short neighborhood walk after lunch when the light is at its widest, or settle at a window seat with a coffee and let the gray do its quiet work. If you\u2019re restless, sort the hall closet or plan meals for the week; if you\u2019re not, enjoy the softness of an overcast Monday that asks little and forgives much.",
