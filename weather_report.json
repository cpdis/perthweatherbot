    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in Subiaco arrives with a soft, honeyed light and a sky brushed with just a few harmless clouds. The sun is still present but no longer sharp; UV has eased into the gentle range and will keep falling toward dusk. The air looks clean and untroubled, the sort of clarity that makes edges seem a touch more defined and colors a little deeper, with no hint of rain in the mood of the day.\n\nInto early evening the clouds will scatter a little more, but the weather stays steady and agreeable. It\u2019s a pleasant close to the day: bright enough for a last errand or two, calm enough for a quiet sit on the veranda. Dress for ease\u2014light layers now, a soft shirt and perhaps a thin cardigan for later; sunglasses useful for the next hour, a hat optional. This is a good window to water the plants, wander to the shop for something simple for dinner, or take an unhurried lap of the neighborhood before the streetlights wink on. If you\u2019ve a book half-finished, the fading light by a window will suit it well.",
