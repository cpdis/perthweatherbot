    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, a gentle layer of calm blankets Downtown San Francisco. The air hangs cool, a whisper of chill that brushes against your skin as it beckons the day to awaken. Partly cloudy skies above hint at the possibility of fleeting sunshine, while temperatures linger around a crisp 45 degrees. A light east wind stirs, barely a breath, as the city prepares to rise and shine. As the day unfolds, expect the sun to spill its warmth, bringing a modest high near 58, with afternoon temperatures retreating slightly to around 55.\n\nLooking out across the city, the landscape offers a painting of muted colors softened by the subtle veil of marine air that hints at fog, especially near the coast. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge stands stoically, perhaps shrouded in wisps of mist that are reminders of the ocean's embrace. For those venturing outside, a light jacket or layers will serve well, an invitation to navigate the day comfortably. As the hours stretch, consider a quiet stroll along the waterfront, perhaps savoring a peaceful cup of coffee from a local caf\u00e9. The world feels softly enchanting in these moments, a gentle escape from the daily bustle.",
