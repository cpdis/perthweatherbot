    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the skies hang heavy with the promise of rain, a murky shroud of clouds blanketing the city. The air is brisk, carrying a chill that beckons for a warm, layered attire; a cozy sweater beneath a windbreaker would serve well against the gusty westerly winds that whip through the streets tonight. With rainfall imminent, conjuring a sense of urgency, one might consider postponing outdoor plans in favor of a night wrapped in warmth\u2014perhaps a gripping novel by the fireplace or a comforting movie accompanied by a cup of tea.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the clouds may begin to part, nudged aside by the sun's tentative ascension. A fleeting chance of rain remains until the afternoon, allowing for moments of sunshine amidst the cooler temperatures. Should the skies cooperate, a leisurely stroll through the city's corners could unveil glimmers of warmth, particularly in the pocketed sunlight of park benches or near the waterfront, where the air feels alive with the scent of the ocean. Embracing a blend of cautious optimism and layers against the lingering chill might be the best approach, whether for an early coffee run or a midday wander among the city\u2019s storied streets.",
