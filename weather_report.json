    "weather_report": "Perth drifts through the lunch hour beneath a soft, pewter ceiling. The light is hushed and cool, with only fleeting chances for a pale gleam to break through; sunshine will be brief and reluctant. UV stays subdued for now, nudging to moderate if a thin window opens around midday, otherwise running low under the thickening cloud. A steady band of rain is due to arrive mid afternoon and linger into the late day, the kind that beads on windows and turns roads to dark satin. Visibility will remain serviceable but softened by showers.\n\nExpect a gray, damp afternoon that asks for a light waterproof, breathable layers, and shoes you don\u2019t mind getting wet; keep a compact umbrella handy, sunscreen only if the sky surprises you with a bright interlude. It\u2019s a good time for close-to-home errands, a slow hour in a quiet cafe or library, a matinee, or a bit of gentle nesting\u2014tidying the desk, tending the plants, planning the week\u2014while the rain writes its small music outside.",
