    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air feels cool and carries an unmistakable hint of salt from the Pacific. The evening sky, parting wisps of soft clouds, reveals a low temperature that nudges around 45 degrees, while a gentle south-southwest breeze whispers through the narrow streets. The horizon is not overtaken by fog this evening, allowing the lights of the city to twinkle in the gathering dusk\u2014a hopeful promise of clarity as the night unfolds.\n\nThe forecast for tomorrow suggests a varied day beginning with a playful bout of sun, beckoning residents and visitors outdoors. A chance of rain creeps in later, potentially brushing the afternoon, but for now, the atmosphere is amiable enough to entice a leisurely morning stroll or a contemplative coffee on the waterfront. Layers are your friend in this somewhat fickle climate; a light jacket paired with a knitted scarf will offer comfort against any incoming chill. As the day progresses, the scattered clouds may flirt with the sun, casting gentle shadows on the historic buildings\u2014perfect for casual explorations through the bustling streets or a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s charming parks. As evening comes, keep an eye on the horizon for signs of those anticipated raindrops, reminding us that in San Francisco, adaptability is the joy of life itself.",
