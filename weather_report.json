    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Fremantle with a clean, untroubled sky, the kind that lets the first stars appear like pinpricks over the water. The day\u2019s glare has faded; UV is effectively nil now, and the night looks settled and serene. Clarity is excellent, no hint of haze or cloud, just a dry, dark-blue vault that promises a steady night.\n\nThe forecast keeps it simple: clear through late evening and after midnight. Expect a gentle coolness after dark; a light layer or easy cardigan will serve you well, with comfortable shoes if you\u2019re stepping out. This is good weather for small, ordinary pleasures: a slow lap around the block, a quiet sit on the balcony to let the house breathe, watering the pots, or finishing a chapter with the window open. If you\u2019re inclined, look up; the sky is tidy and cooperative, made for a brief negotiation with the constellations before calling it a night.",
