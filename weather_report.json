    "weather_report": "Perth steps into the early afternoon bright and open, the sky mostly clear with scattered flecks of cloud that drift without hurry. Light pours through with a confident shine; the day feels lucid rather than harsh, though the sun still carries its November bite. Expect this bright, spotty cloud cover to hold through the afternoon and toward early evening, keeping the day cheerful and dry with good visibility. UV will be strong through the next couple of hours, easing later as the sun tilts.\n\nLean on airy fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; a light shirt over a tee keeps you comfortable as the light shifts. It\u2019s a good window for a shaded lunch on a terrace, a quiet errand on foot, or a detour to a gallery where the cool rooms make time slow down. As the afternoon stretches, a relaxed stroll through a park or a small round of gardening becomes inviting, with the softening sun slipping between the clouds.",
