    "weather_report": "As the afternoon light begins to wane over Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of rain lingers in the air, shrouding the iconic skyline in a whisper of cloud. With temperatures gracefully settling around 59 degrees, the weather feels cool, almost introspective. The anticipation of rainfall, marked by a 60% chance of precipitation, hangs in the atmosphere, promising brief, gentle showers that will likely weave through the streets of the city before night descends. The winds, restless and energetic, gust from the west-northwest at speeds reaching up to 18 mph, rustling leaves and carrying the fresh scent of rain, adding to the day\u2019s allure.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds may partially part, offering glimpses of the dusky sky, while temperatures dip toward a cozy 48 degrees. Dressing in layers is advisable; a light waterproof jacket will shield against the brisk breeze and occasional drizzle, while a warm knit underneath will embrace you against the evening chill. With the allure of the rain-soaked city enticing you, consider a stroll along the waterfront, where the glistening pavement reflects the city lights, or perhaps indulge in a quiet cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where the ambiance melds with the mellow sounds of rain pattering against the windows. This is a moment to embrace the beauty of a serene San Francisco afternoon, a time to pause and let the weather guide your thoughts and activities.",
