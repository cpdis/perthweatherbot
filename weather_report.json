    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, velvet pre-dawn, the air cool on the skin and the eastern edge of the sky quietly brightening. The forecast holds steady and uncomplicated: a cloudless morning giving way to a crisp, bright blue day, the sun clean and insistent. Expect the UV to surge quickly after breakfast, the kind of high summer light that flatters gum leaves and wilts resolve by midday. It looks like a fine day to be alive, provided you respect the glare.\n\nDress lightly and simply: breathable fabrics now, a light layer if you\u2019re out before sunrise, then sunglasses, hat, and sunscreen once the light sharpens. Take advantage of the gentle hours for a walk to the bakery, a small loop through the park, or watering the garden before the heat leans in; run errands early, then let the afternoon be slower indoors with a book or an easy task by an open window. Toward evening, when the light softens again, a short stroll or some quiet time on the veranda will feel just right.",
