    "weather_report": "As the clock gently ticks toward dawn in Downtown San Francisco, there\u2019s an enveloping stillness, a quiet before the anticipated rain that promises to sweep the city. Tonight\u2019s air carries a chill, resting at around 47 degrees, the kind that makes one think of cozy layers and the warmth of a familiar scarf. The low, drifting clouds signal that the day's calm is about to yield to the patter of raindrops, with a 60% certainty of precipitation inviting a reflective mood.\n\nAs Sunday begins, expect the rain to lend a soft soundtrack to the quiet landscape. The promise of a high near 57, dipping slightly as the day unfolds, will lend an air of coziness amidst the overcast skies. The atmosphere feels thick with a marine layer that softens the outlines of the skyline, blurring the sharp edges of reality into something more contemplative. With a gentle south wind, the weather invites warmth and comfort in your choice of clothing\u2014perhaps a snug sweater with a waterproof jacket to keep the dampness at bay. \n\nGiven the day's environment, one might consider a leisurely stroll through the cozy enclaves of the Mission or the hauntingly beautiful Presidio, where the rain-soaked earth yields the scent of fresh pine and wet pavement. Alternatively, retreating into a quaint caf\u00e9, the sounds of conversation and the hiss of the espresso machine providing a warm backdrop, could be a delightful way to spend the day as the rain dances outside the window.",
