    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits under a clear, generous midday sun, the light bright enough to carve crisp edges on everything it touches. Expect a mostly sunny run through the afternoon: a few scattered clouds drifting in after lunch, easing back to faint brushstrokes by late day, with no real hint of mischief in the sky. UV will be punchy at this hour, so a brimmed hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and light breathable layers will serve you well; carry water if you\u2019ll be out a while. The air feels clean and the view long, a good moment for ordinary errands on foot, a quiet sandwich in the shade, or hanging the washing to let the sun do the honest work; later, a gentle spin on the bike or a brief lap of the oval before the light softens would be just right.",
