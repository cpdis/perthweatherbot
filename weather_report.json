    "weather_report": "As the sun bows out gracefully for the day, Subiaco finds itself beneath the endless stretch of a clear sky. The dusk velvet slowly wraps the town in a hushed serenity that only the embrace of a perfect spring evening can provide. Earlier, as the day danced forward, the sun shone with an unfiltered brilliance, casting everything in a golden glow, yet it was kind enough to do so without the searing bite of summertime. Such clarity speaks of a delightful day\u2014one meant for leisurely strolls along paths bathed in gentle sunlight, the kind of day that makes shadows seem like old friends keeping you company.\n\nThe air holds a promise of tranquility, inviting you to step outside in comfortable attire, a light sweater thrown over your shoulder, just in case the night air decides to lean crisp. The lingering warmth encourages gentle pursuits: perhaps a short walk to breathe in the blossoms singing their evening lullabies or a quiet sit on a balcony, book in hand, to indulge in stories as the sky shifts from azure to indigo. The scene before you presents an invitation to enjoy the simplicity of life, where the world is at ease and time feels deliciously slow, under a dome of stars patiently waiting to whisper their tales in the coming night.",
