    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a bright, sun-drenched Thanksgiving Day unfolds, with clarity reigning over the skyline. The air carries the freshness typical of fall, supportive of the day\u2019s anticipated high of 58 degrees. While the sun shines down, casting soft shadows and illuminating the bustling streets, a gentle north-northeast breeze brushes against warm cheeks, reminiscent of a comforting embrace from a fond friend. As the afternoon approaches, the temperatures will dip slightly, inviting a snug layering of light sweaters or jackets, just enough to counterbalance the cool wind.\n\nAs night draws near, a mosaic of clouds will take shape, shrouding the sky in a gentle gray, though the fog remains at bay, leaving the day largely unmarred by the usual marine layer. This favorable weather beckons city wanderers to explore the quiet corners of neighborhood parks or take leisurely strolls along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for a warm drink at a quaint caf\u00e9 or enjoying the last vestiges of daylight from an inviting bench. Embrace the detailed serenity of the day, where the layering of nature\u2019s hues invites calm reflection or quiet companionship as the sunset slowly transforms the skyline into a silhouette against the promise of a cool evening.",
