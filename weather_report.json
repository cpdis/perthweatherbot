    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the sky is a clean, unblemished pane of ink, the air still and a touch cool, as if holding its breath for first light. The forecast keeps it simple: clear at sunrise and through the early morning, which means a bright, crystalline start and fast-rising UV once the sun lifts. Expect that hard, honest spring sunshine to sharpen edges and throw long, blue shadows; by late morning it will feel decidedly sun-forward, with excellent visibility and a dry, clear feel to the day.\n\nDress in light layers you can shed quickly, with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen at the ready. It looks like a pleasant morning for ordinary pleasures: a quiet walk to the bakery, coffee in a patch of early light, hanging the washing to take advantage of the brisk clarity, or a gentle ride to work before the glare really sets in. Gardeners might water early, then retreat to shade as the day brightens; errand-doers will find the air kind and the sky obliging, provided they respect the sun.",
