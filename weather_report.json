    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Adelaide with a quiet, wintry hush and a ceiling of cloud drifting in, the kind that dulls the edges of the city lights and promises a change of mood. The air feels cool and expectant; sunshine is off the stage now, and the UV is negligible. It\u2019s a night of blurred horizons and soft echoes, the sort of clarity where you hear the train before you see it.\n\nLater tonight and toward the small hours, pulses of moderate rain are due, making for a grey, low-contrast start to the new day and keeping any early sun shy and short-lived. Expect puddled footpaths and windscreen wipers earning their keep. Dress in layers with a light waterproof or a hooded jacket, and choose shoes that won\u2019t mind a splash. For this hour, lean into home comforts: finish the dishes, set up tomorrow\u2019s coffee, file a few papers you\u2019ve been ignoring, or lose yourself in a quiet chapter while the first drops begin to tap the glass. Morning plans want pragmatism\u2014leave a few extra minutes, carry a compact umbrella, and let the city\u2019s softer palette set the tempo.",
