    "weather_report": "Subiaco awakens, cloaked in a protective shield of broken clouds. The sun, denied dominance by the fractious cloud cover, strains to break free, casting an ethereal glow upon the waking city. It's a day of obscured skies and muted sunshine, offering a gentle reprieve from the harsh glare we often associate with summer's entirety. The UV index, blessedly subdued, places no undue burden on the skin, favouring those who shy away from sun cream or brimmed hats.\n\nTurn your face upward, feel the cloud-filtered sunlight kiss your cheeks, and the gentlest of breezes tousle your hair. The day invites a casual wardrobe, light cottons perhaps, or loose linen shirts, paired stylishly with a favoured pair of sunglasses. Savour the excuse to indulge in an al fresco breakfast, the early morning newspaper spread out before you, as the city gradually comes to life. Or perhaps this is the day for a meandering walk through the park, stepping lightly over dew-kissed grass, the hushed whispers of the city carried to you on the breeze.",
