    "weather_report": "Evening has settled softly over West Busselton; the warmth of the day is ebbing, the breeze slackening, and the sky loosening from scattered cloud toward a cleaner, star-pricked blue. From late evening into the small hours the forecast favors openness: clouds thinning to just a few, no hint of mischief, and the air turning glassy and calm. The sun is long gone now, so the UV bite has dropped to near-nothing; clarity is good, the horizon uncomplicated, a night for quiet distances and gentle sound.\n\nDress light but keep a cardigan or thin jacket handy if you linger by the bay; the kind of night where sneakers and an easy layer feel just right. It\u2019s pleasant rather than exciting, perfect for an unhurried foreshore stroll, a slow lap on the bike under streetlamps, or simply a chair on the veranda with a book, letting the salt air launder the last thoughts of the day. If there are errands to finish or a dog to walk, this is a calm, forgiving window to do it.",
