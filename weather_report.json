    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil evening unfolds under a canopy of partially cloudy skies. The air is crisp, gently brushing against the skin, with temperatures dappling around the 46-degree mark. As the night progresses, a subtle embrace of warmth is anticipated, drifting up to about 48 degrees. The soft whisper of the east-southeast wind, barely rustling at 1 to 5 mph, adds a delicate touch to the stillness of the night.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the sun will emerge to banish the haze that lingers in the early hours, coaxing warmth into the day as temperatures peak near 62 degrees around midday, before softly descending to 58 in the afternoon. The northeast winds will stir slightly, offering a refreshing breeze that can uplift the spirits while enhancing the feeling of clarity in the air. Visibility is generally good, hinting that any fog is likely to retreat back into the bay for the time being. Given this delightful yet mild forecast, a light sweater or a light jacket would be advisable for early risers heading out, especially as the temperature slips down into the evening. With the golden sun gracing the day, it is an ideal moment for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet reading session in one of the city\u2019s lush parks, enjoying the gentle shift from the hush of night to the cheer of day.",
