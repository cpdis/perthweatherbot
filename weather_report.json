    "weather_report": "Midday on Rottnest feels washed in clean, salt-bright light, the sort that sharpens edges and makes the ocean hum with color. The forecast leans toward a clear early afternoon, then softening into scattered cloud toward late day, so expect a sun-forward few hours followed by gentler, painterly skies. UV will be punchy through the early afternoon despite the spring-fresh air; it\u2019s the kind of day where shade is your friend, and the horizon looks wonderfully crisp.\n\nDress for an easy amble: light layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses that don\u2019t squint at the world, and sunscreen you\u2019ll actually reapply. Tuck a light jumper in your bag for the cooler turn near sunset. It\u2019s a pleasant day to do ordinary things well\u2014nurse a coffee on the jetty and watch the ferries trade lines on the water, wander the path by the salt lakes and count the shifts of color, leaf through a paperback on a bench with your back to the wind, or browse the little museum before a lazy circuit to a quiet cove. Let the scattered clouds, when they arrive, take the glare off the afternoon and make a slow walk feel like the right kind of plan.",
