    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is a patchwork: broken cloud drifting like slow ships, then thinning toward scattered tufts that reveal a few honest stars. The night feels steady and calm, not murky, the sort of clarity that makes streetlights look a little warmer than usual. By dawn those clouds should keep moving along, leaving a brighter canvas with intervals of sunshine. Expect a fair, lucid day overall, the sun turning confident by late morning and the UV biting hard despite the passing cloud.\n\nDress in light layers now, a soft jacket for the small hours, then shift to breathable fabrics, sunglasses, and a brimmed hat once the day gets its glow; sunscreen is not optional. It\u2019s pleasant enough for small routines: an early walk before the light grows sharp, a quiet coffee on the porch, watering the garden ahead of the heat, a spin to the bakery, windows open to air the rooms. Later, run a few errands or read by a bright window and let the afternoon drift by in clean, serviceable light.",
