    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle hush settles over the city, casting an inviting stillness against the backdrop of mostly cloudy skies. The air is crisp, caressed by a soft north-northeast breeze that stirs the leaves of nearby trees, creating a symphony of whispers. The temperature dips to a cool 46 degrees, urging residents and visitors alike to wrap themselves in layers for warmth and comfort. The clouds, though thickening, create a dramatic canvas through which the last remnants of daylight fade into the evening.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect a reprieve as the clouds give way to a mostly sunny Saturday. The day promises a high near 60, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the local cafes where you can sip a warm drink while indulging in delightful pastries. As the afternoon unfolds, temperatures may fall slightly, hitting about 57 degrees, presenting a pleasant backdrop for an afternoon of exploration. Given the ever-present chance of morning fog, particularly along the bay, especially towards the Golden Gate, it might be wise to don a light jacket and perhaps a scarf, keeping in mind that the charm of San Francisco lies in its ever-changing moods. With the right attire, one can savor the day, taking leisurely walks along the Embarcadero or finding a quiet spot in a park to revel in the crisp air and clear views as they emerge.",
