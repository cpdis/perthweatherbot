    "weather_report": "Midday in Perth wears a dappled sky: broken clouds drifting like loose pages, letting through warm, lively light without the hard glare. The sun will keep slipping in and out all afternoon, offering bright spells and soft shade in turn; expect that filtered glow to linger toward late day. UV will still have a bite through early afternoon despite the patchwork cover, easing as the sun slides down. The air feels clear enough for long views, but with edges softened by the shifting veil above. Altogether, a pleasant day to be out, tempered rather than harsh.\n\nDress for an easy wander: a light shirt, breathable layers you can shrug on toward evening, sunglasses, and a hat; sunscreen is still wise if you\u2019re out for more than a moment. It\u2019s a good time for modest errands on foot, a slow ride to the shops, or a quiet hour on a bench with a book, pausing when the sun breaks through. If you\u2019re at home, throw open a window, hang the washing to catch those brighter intervals, or tend to balcony plants while the light tilts gentler.",
