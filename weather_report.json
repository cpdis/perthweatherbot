    "weather_report": "As dawn creeps over Downtown San Francisco, the early chill lingers, inviting the city into a gentle embrace of partly cloudy skies. The temperature settles near 45, compelling a light layering of warmth as the day unfolds. With new light illuminating the skyline, the sun peeks through the clouds, casting a soft glow that hints at clearer moments ahead, but a precise touch of haze still clings to the horizon. In the air, a faint breeze whispers through the streets, carrying the scent of damp earth from the overnight moisture.\n\nAs the afternoon approaches, a pleasant moderation in temperature awaits, hovering around 55 degrees, whispering of a cozy urban stroll or perhaps a quiet afternoon in one of the many local parks. Although the sun will try to assert itself, the lingering coastal fog may still wrap its tendrils around the Golden Gate, leaving pockets of mystery and coolness. Attire reminiscent of layers will best serve those venturing out; a light jacket should suffice, paired with comfortable shoes ready for a relaxed exploration. A visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 for a warming brew or a leisurely walk by the waterfront would harmonize perfectly with today\u2019s weather\u2014a timely retreat from the bustling pace of life while enjoying the sweet, muted charm of a San Franciscan winter's day.",
