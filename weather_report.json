    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Friday, Downtown San Francisco revels in a moment of tranquility under a partly cloudy sky. The chill of the night lingers, with temperatures nudging past the cool threshold of 49. As dawn approaches, the winds remain gentle, whispering through the city at a mere two miles per hour. Yet, the promise of a beautiful morning emerges with the sun breaking through the clouds, ready to cast its light on an inviting day.\n\nBy midday, the sun will dominate the sky, bringing warmth just shy of 62 degrees before gracefully dipping to around 59 in the afternoon. Though the air will feel fresh, the clarity is striking; there\u2019s no fog to cloak the landmarks, allowing the Golden Gate Bridge to stand proud against the horizon. A soft north-northeast breeze might cool the skin, suggesting a light jacket would be suitable for those venturing outside. One might delight in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps pausing for a comforting cup of coffee or finding a quiet bench to embrace the serenity of the moment. With such pleasant weather, a visit to a local gallery or a meandering exploration of hidden alleyways could unveil the character of the city in its most charming light.",
