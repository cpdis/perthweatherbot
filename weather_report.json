    "weather_report": "This evening in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle chill envelops the city as the sky dons a veil of partial cloudiness, tinged with the promise of a cooler night ahead. The soft breeze from the west-northwest carries whispers of the bay and hints at the marine layer lingering just beyond the horizon, a reminder of the city's close embrace with the ocean. As the night deepens, the low temperature settles around a cool 48, suggesting that a light jacket or a cozy sweater might be most appropriate for evening strolls along the city\u2019s iconic streets.\n\nAs you venture into tomorrow, Washington's Birthday is expected to greet you with a welcome blend of partly sunny skies. The day will likely usher in a slightly warmer atmosphere, reaching near 57 degrees, before gently retreating to about 55 in the afternoon. With light winds dancing overhead at 5 to 10 mph, it promises a comfortable outing perfect for exploring the many hidden nooks of the city. Perhaps a quiet moment in a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm beverage while watching the world pass by, or a leisurely walk through one of the local parks, where you can enjoy the symphony of rustling leaves and distant laughter. Mellow yet invigorating, these mild days of winter provide a fine canvas for everyday explorations, reminding us of the beauty in the mundane.",
