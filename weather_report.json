    "weather_report": "Before sunrise the town is hushed, the ocean breathing softly and the sky scrubbed clear, stars loosening their grip as a pale seam of light gathers over the water. The forecast is simple and kind: clear at dawn and staying clear through the early morning, the sort of bright, razor-clean light that makes colours ring. Once the sun lifts, it will be generous and unblinking; UV will climb quickly after breakfast and be punishing by late morning, so shade will be your ally.\n\nSet out in a light layer now, and plan to shed it for breathable fabrics, a wide-brim hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen as the day opens up. This early hour is perfect for a quiet walk along Marine Parade, a thermos coffee on a bench, or watering the garden before the sun starts to insist. Run simple errands soon, then retreat to a veranda or a patch of dappled shade with a book; if you\u2019re beach\u2011bound, make it a brief dip and keep to the umbrellas when you pause. It\u2019s a lucid, pleasant start that invites small, unhurried tasks and the gentle pleasure of being outside while the light is still soft.",
