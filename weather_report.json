    "weather_report": "As the clock marches gently past midnight, Downtown San Francisco embraces a moody embrace of rain, the city\u2019s iconic dampness kissing the air before dawn breaks. The skies, heavy with moisture, guarantee a shroud of clouds overhead, their dark nuances painted against the soft glow of urban lights. A brisk southwest wind stirs, whispering secrets of the night while nudging the temperature upwards, inviting the chill of late autumn to dance through the streets until about 54 degrees.\n\nBy daybreak, the rain will yield to bursts of sunlight, illuminating the city in vibrant hues and twinkling with the promise of better weather. The high near 62 will bring a welcome warmth by noon, though it will gradually recede as the afternoon unfolds. The marine layer, lingering but retreating, may clothe the vistas with a gentle haze, particularly along the coastal edges, casting a soft, enigmatic charm over landmarks like the Golden Gate. Attire recommendation? Lean into layers\u2014a light jacket will prove wise against that ocean breeze, especially when contemplating a stroll through the verdant expanses of Golden Gate Park or a coffee at an unassuming caf\u00e9, where you can delight in watching the world stir awake under the soft sunlight. This Thursday promises pleasantries amidst the ever-redictable San Francisco vagaries, with the city adorned in an inviting calmness perfect for simple explorations.",
