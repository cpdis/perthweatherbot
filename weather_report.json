    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air thickens with the promise of rain, a gentle yet persistent reminder that winter\u2019s embrace still holds sway. The clouds loom heavy and gray, blanketing the city like a cozy but oppressive quilt. The temperatures linger in the low fiftys, barely flirting with warmth, while gusts of wind whisper through the streets at fourteen miles per hour, adding an edge to the damp chill. With abandonment, the city prepares itself for the night ahead; it's a certainty that rain will fall, drenching sidewalks and enriching the already vibrant sounds of the city washed anew.\n\nTomorrow, the rain will not relent. Instead, it will continue its melancholy serenade, a steady patter against windows, with promise of yet another inch to fall. Residents and visitors alike will find it prudent to dress in layers\u2014an absorbent raincoat, sturdy boots, and perhaps an umbrella to shield against the elements. Given the drizzly forecast and early darkness, one might find solace indoors, perhaps indulging in a warm cup of coffee at a corner caf\u00e9 while watching the world blur by through fogged glass. The rich aroma of brewed beans will mingle with hushed conversations, providing a respite from the weather's caprice, reminding all that even amidst the storm, moments of warmth and camaraderie flourish.",
