    "weather_report": "Denmark eases into the morning under a roof of broken cloud, the light softened to a pewter sheen that flatters brick and water alike. Sun breaks come and go, brief bright pages turned by a slow hand; the UV stays low for the season, perhaps nudging upward around midday if the cloud thins, but never fierce. Visibility is fair and the air feels clean, more crisp than cold, the sort of sky that keeps color close to the ground rather than blazing from above.\n\nExpect the patchwork to linger through the day with tempered sunshine and a gentle, steady feel. Dress in easy layers\u2014a light jacket, long sleeves, maybe a scarf for comfort\u2014and keep sunglasses handy for those surprise openings in the cloud. It\u2019s a good day for small errands by foot, a late-morning coffee near a window, sorting a shelf you\u2019ve ignored, or a calm loop through a park to listen to leaves practice their autumn lines. If the afternoon brightens, bring a book outside and let the day do what it does best: unhurried, serviceable, quietly kind.",
