    "weather_report": "As night descends on Downtown San Francisco, the air carries the unmistakable scent of impending rain, a reminder of the city's ever-shifting climate. The forecast hints at a drizzle in the early hours, giving way to steady rainfall as we edge toward dawn. With temperatures hovering around a cool 53, the gentle stirrings of a northeast wind serve to whisper reminders of the chill that accompanies San Francisco evenings. The skyline, usually sharp and vibrant, now shrouded in clouds, blurs the outlines of iconic structures, and the looming chance of rain, tickling at 60%, implies that umbrellas may soon be the favored accessory.\n\nAs we turn to Sunday, the rain is set to take center stage, transforming our beloved city into a canvas of gray, with expectations of a high near 61 degrees, only to wane to 59 as the day unfolds. This is a day best suited for cozy indoor retreats, perhaps curling up with a good book at a local caf\u00e9, or exploring the myriad of galleries that offer shelter from the downpour. The possibility of light rain throughout reinforces the appeal of comfortable layers\u2014think soft sweaters, waterproof jackets, and an inviting scarf to ward off the damp chill. Through the veil of clouds and moisture, the city possesses an understated beauty, encouraging a slow pace, an appreciation for the quiet moments indoors, giving us space to savor the essence of San Francisco that remains captivating, even under an umbrella.",
