    "weather_report": "Houston wakes to a quilt of low gray cloud, the light soft and directionless, the sun hiding somewhere above the ceiling. Expect the overcast to linger through the morning and likely into the afternoon, with only a pale brightening at midday. UV exposure stays low under this thick cover, and the day will feel muted and calm, the skyline a little ghosted at the edges but visibility otherwise fine. It\u2019s not a dramatic day, just gently dim, made for slow starts and unhurried errands.\n\nDress in light layers\u2014a long-sleeve shirt or a soft sweater with a breathable jacket\u2014and skip the sunglasses; a cap or hood is enough if a mist drifts in. Comfortable shoes will suit a late-morning walk along the bayou or a lap around the neighborhood while the city hums to itself. Indoors, this is good weather for a library stop, a focused hour at the gym, or reorganizing a corner of the kitchen before an afternoon coffee. Pleasant in a quiet, practical way, with no harsh glare and no rush.",
