    "weather_report": "Katy settles under a lid of overcast, the night sky a soft charcoal with no stars to puncture it. The day ran gray from morning to midday and never quite brightened; the sun stayed veiled, and the UV index remained low then faded to nothing after dusk. The air feels steady rather than dramatic, the horizon muted, streetlights haloed, a calm, dim clarity that invites quiet rather than hustle.\n\nIf you\u2019re stepping out, a light jacket or sweater over long sleeves will feel right; add an extra layer if you run cool. Comfortable shoes for an unhurried errand, a short dog walk, or a quiet lap around the block. Indoors suits the mood too: sort tomorrow\u2019s bag, batch-cook something simple, water the plants, or cue up that podcast you keep pausing. It\u2019s a workable, unflashy evening\u2014pleasant in its own subdued way, with the clouds content to keep the night gentle and low-contrast.",
