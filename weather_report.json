    "weather_report": "As the new year dawns in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle invitation awaits outside. The morning reveals a canvas of softness, where sunlight peeks through the lingering clouds, casting a muted glow over the city\u2019s iconic skyline. With the temperature hovering around 57 degrees, a light chill kisses the air, hinting at the cooler afternoon as it dips a degree or two. While the east-southeast breeze whispers at just 5 mph, the atmosphere remains serene, with glimpses of blue unraveling above the muted urban tapestry.\n\nYet, as one surveys the horizon towards the Golden Gate, the subtle presence of the marine layer looms. Darker shadows cling closer to the Bay, a reminder of the fog that often graces this coastal enclave. Those venturing out might find it wise to don layers; a light jacket or sweater would provide comfort against the ocean's breath. The day, though tranquil, beckons for modest plans. Perhaps a stroll through one of the winding streets, visiting a neighborhood caf\u00e9 for a warm brew, or wandering into a lesser-known gallery\u2014simple pleasures to welcome the new year gently and thoughtfully.",
