    "weather_report": "Perth wakes under a quiet, inky-blue sky, the air cool and clean, stars thinning toward a pale seam on the horizon. The forecast holds steady with clear skies through the morning, promising a bright, unclouded day that will sharpen colors and throw crisp shadows. As the sun climbs, expect the UV to ramp up quickly; by late morning it will be strong, the kind that warms the bones but asks for respect. Today looks pleasant in that uncomplicated, honest way: dry, clear, and likely quite sunny.\n\nSet out in light layers for the early hours\u2014a soft jumper over a tee\u2014then pare back to short sleeves as the light strengthens. A hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen will earn their keep, and a bottle of water won\u2019t go amiss. This is a morning for ordinary pleasures: a quiet walk at first light, a brisk pedal to work, hanging the washing to drink in the sun, or a coffee outside where you can watch the day brighten. By late morning, shift to shade or slip indoors for a spell\u2014an errand run, a chapter at the library\u2014then step back out when the glare softens. The day invites simple momentum, unhurried and clear-headed.",
