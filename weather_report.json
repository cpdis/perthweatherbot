    "weather_report": "As the clock gently ticks past midnight, Downtown San Francisco lies enveloped in a persistent blanket of rain. The air carries a cool weight, with the temperature hovering around 57 degrees, while the relentless south-southeast winds whip through the streets, rustling the leaves in a dance of impending storms. With rain anticipated to drench the city through the morning hours, a palpable sense of anonymity hangs over the skyline; the Golden Gate Bridge, usually a proud sentinel, is now shrouded in low-hanging clouds, retreating into the ether as the marine layer claims its territory. \n\nAs dawn approaches, expect the gray sky to settle in, with temperatures gently descending throughout the day, ultimately resting near 58 degrees by afternoon. The forecast hints at an additional inch or two of rain, transforming the sidewalks into glistening rivers reflecting the dim light of street lamps. Dress warmly, in layers perhaps: a sturdy rain jacket would offer solace against the elements, while comfortable shoes would resist the creeping chill. Consider curling up in a cozy caf\u00e9 with a warm beverage, or perhaps indulging in the city's rich cultural tapestry by exploring its galleries and small shops, taking refuge from the rain. With every drop, the city breathes a sigh of renewal, inviting you to pause and appreciate its resilient charm beneath a veil of clouds.",
