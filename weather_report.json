    "weather_report": "As daylight breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the scene unfolds with a tempered charm. The city finds itself wrapped in gentle sunshine, though hints of an early spring chill linger in the air. At a high approach, temperatures gracefully flirt with fifty-six, only to succumb later in the day to a slow descent toward fifty-four, an invitation to bundle up just a touch more as the afternoon progresses. The light breeze whispers through the streets, adding a soft note of refreshment, while expectations of evening rain loom, teasing from the horizon.\n\nCloudy curtains are drawn across the sky, with a gentle promise of misty rain starting after the witching hour of four. The low of forty-seven beckons a thoughtful selection of layers\u2014perhaps a snug sweater under a light jacket, perfect for meandering through local caf\u00e9 corners or enjoying the fleeting light in Golden Gate Park. As clouds stretch and swirl with a hint of mystery, the marine layer raises its head, lightly obscuring some of the city's iconic landmarks, inviting contemplation and introspection. A stroll through the less crowded avenues or a quiet visit to a favorite bookstore offers a tranquil respite from the day, a chance to savor the nuanced ambiance inherent to this ever-evolving city under cover of soft clouds.",
