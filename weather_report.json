    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a soft embrace of clarity, where mostly sunny skies lend a warm glow to the streets below. At this moment, the temperature holds steady around 60 degrees, gradually easing into a more gentle 56 as the day wades towards evening. The air whispers with a light, north-northeast breeze, nudging gently at the edges of your coat, a reminder of the chill that evenings here often bring. \n\nAs twilight approaches, a shift is expected; clouds will gradually blanket the horizon, conjugating with cool evening air to usher in a low of around 46 degrees. The marine layer, a steadfast companion along this coastal enclave, may coalesce in the backdrop, but for now, visibility is pleasantly unobstructed, inviting an invigorating stroll through the city's artful streets or perhaps a leisurely coffee at a window seat, watching the ebb and flow of locals and tourists alike. As the night beckons, don a light layer to ward off the chill, and consider a gentle walk along the waterfront, allowing the tantalizing interplay of city lights and rippling waters to enrich your evening.",
