    "weather_report": "As night enfolds Downtown San Francisco, soft rain begins to dance upon the pavement, a gentle prelude to what tomorrow will bring. The air, thick with moisture and whispers of the sea, languorously hangs around 54 degrees, wrapping the city in a cool embrace. A south southwest wind picks up in strength, rustling the leaves and carrying the scent of wet earth throughout the streets, while clouds blanket the sky like a heavy quilt, obscuring the stars above. Expectations of rain persist, with nightfall promising an 80% chance of further precipitation, perhaps nudging you to contemplate staying indoors.\n\nTomorrow will greet the city with a somber, rain-soaked canvas, reaching a high of 59 before retreating to 56 in the afternoon, as the relentless rains pour down in earnest. With gusts up to 31 mph, umbrellas will become reluctant companions on your ventures outside. As you navigate the day, consider donning a sturdy raincoat paired with waterproof footwear for practicality, as splashes from puddles will be inevitable. Should the day drive you indoors, there\u2019s solace in the comfort of a hands-on craft project or perhaps a stroll through the aromatic aisles of a local bookstore. You might even opt for a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring warm brews while people-watching from the window, beckoning inspiration from the rainy canvas beyond.",
