    "weather_report": "Across Denmark the afternoon drifted under broken clouds, the sun filtering in and out in brief, forgiving intervals before slipping west. By this hour the light is mostly gone, the sky a deep slate with scattered gaps, and the UV index essentially nil. Clarity is mixed: not foggy, not crystal, a soft-edged evening where landmarks seem slightly muted and the first city lights feel warmer than usual. No drama in the sky, just a calm, layered ceiling moving along at its own pace.\n\nIt looks like a mostly dry, temperate night that feels quietly pleasant if you keep moving. Dress in a light jacket or a sweater, maybe a scarf for the chill that gathers after sunset; no special rain gear necessary. Good moments now are small and ordinary: a short walk around the block to stretch the day from your legs, a lazy bike ride to pick up bread, a tidy of the kitchen while the kettle sighs, or a chapter by the window with the streetlights flickering on. Expect more of the same through the evening: broken clouds, gentle air, and time unspooling without hurry.",
