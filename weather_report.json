    "weather_report": "Subiaco is tucked under a quiet, lucid sky tonight, the air cool and dry, with starlight pooling on rooftops and footpaths. It feels calm and unhurried, the sort of night that invites a deep breath at the back door. UV is essentially absent now, and the clarity is notable; sounds carry, edges are crisp, and the darkness is gentle rather than bleak.\n\nToward dawn a few light clouds may wander in, but first light should arrive clean and bright, promising a sunny start. UV will stay low at sunrise and then climb quickly as the morning matures, so plan shade, sunscreen, and a hat if you\u2019ll be out later. For now, a light jumper or jacket suits the hour; set out easy layers you can peel away once the sun takes charge. This late, make a pot of tea, jot tomorrow\u2019s errands, or step out for a brief, unhurried stroll. At first light, a short walk to greet the morning, a simple spin on the bike, or a quick visit to the bakery would fit the mood of a clear, uncomplicated day.",
