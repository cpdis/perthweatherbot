    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning greets the city with a heavy quilt of clouds, promising a persistent patter of rain throughout the day. The temperature is a mild 59 degrees, though it may inch down to a cooler 56 as the afternoon wears on. The brisk south wind carries the unmistakable scent of rain and sea, gusting up to a near-stormy 39 mph, further cloaking the streets in a damp chill that calls for a warm layer. With a 100% chance of precipitation, one can expect the sidewalks to glisten rather than shine, while the distant outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and city skyline struggle to penetrate the thick air.\n\nDraping oneself in a waterproof coat and perhaps donning a lightweight scarf would be prudent against the chill and rain. As the day unfolds, consider finding refuge in the cozy corners of a favorite caf\u00e9 or bookstore, where the gentle sound of raindrops can be a soothing backdrop to the day's reading. Alternatively, a leisurely stroll beneath an umbrella could unveil the city\u2019s quiet beauty, with each raindrop painting the landscape anew. Today is not shouting for grand adventures, but rather whispering for simplicity within the embrace of San Francisco's brooding charm.",
