    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco opens under a clean blue dome, the light already sharpening edges and lending the streets a quiet sparkle. The forecast keeps faith with what you can see: clear sky through late morning and into the afternoon, a day built for shadows and brightness. Expect a very sunny stretch as the sun climbs; the UV will rise briskly toward midday, so it\u2019s a day for respect as well as enjoyment. The air feels clear and honest, the sort of visibility that makes distant gum leaves seem close enough to touch.\n\nDress in light layers you can pare back as the warmth builds, with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a swipe of sunscreen for good measure. It looks pleasantly uncomplicated: ideal for a midmorning wander to a local caf\u00e9, hanging washing that will dry without fuss, or an unhurried loop through Kings Park to watch the first hints of spring settle in. Run errands on foot before the sun is at its most insistent, then retreat to a verandah or a quiet corner by a window for the early afternoon, letting the bright day do its work outside while you read, sort a drawer, or plan the weekend.",
