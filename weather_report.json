    "weather_report": "Late afternoon in San Francisco drifts toward evening under a mottled sky: scattered clouds at first, thickening to a more insistent blanket as night settles in. The light feels muted, colors softened; whatever sun remains will be brief and filtered, with the UV index essentially negligible now. Expect a calm, gray-tinged night with decent clarity, though edges of the view may seem a touch smudged by the cloud cover. It\u2019s more contemplative than dazzling, the kind of dusk where city lights take over the job of shining.\n\nLayers will serve you best: a comfortable sweater or long sleeves under a light jacket, something you can tug close if a cool, damp breath comes off the streets. This is an evening for small errands and easy rituals\u2014walk a quiet block before dinner, pick up a few groceries, linger with a warm cup and a notebook, straighten the week\u2019s loose corners at home. Let the night be simple, unhurried, and gently lit.",
