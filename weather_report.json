    "weather_report": "As the calmness of the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the sky stretches wide and mostly clear, providing a serene backdrop to the familiar silhouettes of the Bay. Tonight's low beckons a chilly embrace, hovering around the 45-degree mark, while faint whispers of the east-southeast wind carry soft gusts, adding a gentle chill that reminds one of the city's iconic breeziness. In this tranquil atmosphere, the clarity allows for a distant view of the Golden Gate Bridge, its majestic form outlined against the ink-black night, illuminated by the twinkling lights of the city below.\n\nTomorrow, dawn will break brightly, promising a sunny day with a high near 59 degrees, gradually dipping to a cooler 57 as the afternoon wanes. The northeast wind will persist, offering a brisk freshness that invigorates. Dress in layers; a light jacket will complement a warm sweater, allowing for comfortable exploration amidst the invigorating air. Engage in the mundane pleasures of life \u2014 perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the sun's rays glint dance across the bay, or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of coffee mixes delightfully with the crisp breeze. The day calls for a little adventure, unfurling like the city's fog, which, for now, rests just out of sight and mind, waiting to return in its own time.",
