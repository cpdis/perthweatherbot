    "weather_report": "Denmark wakes to a clean, roomy sky, the sun already brightening rooftops while a few friendly clouds drift without hurry. The light is crisp and honest, the kind that sharpens edges and carries far; visibility feels excellent. UV is gentle for the season\u2014soft enough for a leisurely morning outdoors\u2014though a pair of sunglasses will make the world more comfortable and a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t hurt if you linger toward midday.\n\nThrough the day, expect mostly sunshine with only thin, passing cloud, a pleasant, clear-headed sort of weather that invites errands done on foot and unhurried conversations at a caf\u00e9 table. The air will still have an autumn nip, so think in layers: a light jacket or sweater, perhaps a scarf if you\u2019re shade-prone. It\u2019s a good day to walk to the bakery, to sit with a book near a window, to take a modest loop through a nearby park and come home with a pocket of leaves and a clearer mind.",
