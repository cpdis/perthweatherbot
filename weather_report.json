    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco is all sharp light and blue glass, the sort of clear sky that leaves crisp shadows at your feet. The forecast holds that line through the afternoon and toward evening, with not a cloud to complicate the horizon. Expect strong sunshine and a UV index that runs very high around this hour; the day feels clean and lucid, with a hard sparkle to every surface.\n\nDress light and breathable, with a wide brim, dark lenses, and unapologetic sunscreen; keep water close and seek shade when you can. It\u2019s a good afternoon for simple errands done in short bursts between cool doorways, or a quiet lunch in a courtyard where the light filters through leaves. As the heat eases later, take a gentle stroll to the shops, tend the garden while the shadows lengthen, or ride a slow loop through the neighborhood and let the air cool your sleeves.",
