As the city slumbers, a gentle breeze from the north-northeast stirs the air, whispering secrets of the morning ahead. With dawn expected to bring fleeting periods of sunshine, the day unfolds with the promise of a chance of rain later\u2014a reminder that the ever-changing Bay Area weather is as unpredictable as the tides themselves. \n\nBy afternoon, the warmth of the sun dance atop chillier temperatures, hovering near 59 degrees before yielding to a cooler 56. The skies will flaunt a mostly sunny disposition until the evening, when clouds will draw near, bringing with them the possibility of rain. As you prepare to step out into this shifting light, layers are your best companion\u2014perhaps a light jacket to guard against the brisk air, a scarf to shield your neck, and sturdy shoes for the dampened streets. The day invites you to wander; consider a stroll through your local caf\u00e9, a moment to indulge in a warm drink while watching the world drift by, or an afternoon in the serene corners of a nearby park, where the foliage dances under the soft breeze.",
