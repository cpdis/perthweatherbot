    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun casts its gentle light over the city, hinting at a serene afternoon with a high near 63 degrees. As the day unfolds, temperatures will gradually slip to a cool 60, suggesting a crispness in the air that invites layers. A soft north-northwest breeze, barely stirring at 6 mph, complements the clear skies that dominate this delightful December morning. There are no signs of fog or troubling marine layers attempting to creep in; rather, the scene is poised for clarity, inviting exploration.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the sky will remain mostly clear, settling into a tranquil scene with a low around 49 degrees. A northwest breeze at a gentle pace will wrap the city in a comforting chill, perfect for cozying up in a light jacket or a sweater while enjoying a dusk walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps sharing stories over coffee at a local caf\u00e9. Given the inviting yet cool atmosphere, a stroll through the vibrant streets or an intimate gathering with friends will perfectly match the calm, pleasant ambiance of the day.",
