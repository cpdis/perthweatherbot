    "weather_report": "As the sun dips lower in the sky above Downtown San Francisco, the urban landscape remains bright and cheerful, with a clear vista toward the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, shimmering under the fading light. This afternoon presents a welcome amalgam of sun and serenity, with temperatures gently settling around the mild 58 degrees, fostered by a soft north wind. The air is crisp, almost invigorating, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps indulging in a warm drink at a nearby caf\u00e9, while the energy of the city starts to mellow into the evening.\n\nAs twilight envelopes the city, expect a subtle transition with the arrival of partly cloudy skies, gently cradling the low temperature of around 49 degrees. With little hint of fog or the characteristic marine layer that often drapes this coast, tonight's conditions beckon those who favor crisp air and the charm of a vibrant urban backdrop. Layering is advisable; a light jacket over a cozy sweater will suffice to maintain warmth against the encroaching coolness. As the city lights twinkle to life, consider an evening walk through one of the neighborhoods or a quiet gathering with friends, savoring the simple beauty of a San Francisco evening.",
