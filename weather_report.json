    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air is imbued with a crispness that hints at the chill of the night. The skies are partly cloudy, maintaining a pleasant low of around 47 degrees. Gentle winds from the north northeast at about 7 mph weave through the streets, carrying with them the invigorating scent of the bay. The day has transitioned gracefully into evening, and while the city skyline sparkles under the emerging streetlights, the clarity is punctuated by a soft marine layer lingering slightly off the coast, subtly hinting at the presence of fog without fully enveloping the urban landscape.\n\nTomorrow promises a delight of sunshine, as the forecast heralds a high close to 59 degrees, gradually descending to the mid-50s by the afternoon. A slight increase in wind speed offers a refreshing touch to the sunny warmth. Those venturing out might consider layering\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a cozy sweater\u2014well suited for the cool morning air, while ensuring comfortable attire for the sun-filled hours ahead. As you navigate through the myriad of attractions that the city presents, from casual caf\u00e9s to relaxed art galleries, now is an opportune time to enjoy leisurely strolls along the waterfront, appreciating the serene beauty that this enchanting city offers at the cusp of winter.",
