    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the air feels soft and damp, the world reduced to streetlamp halos and the hush of a slow shower moving through. Light rain is likely to drift across the morning, shading the sunrise and keeping the sky a muted pewter. Any sunshine will be stingy early, with only brief, pale openings between clouds; if those breaks widen toward late morning, the spring UV can turn surprisingly assertive, so a dab of sunscreen is wise even on a grey day. The day reads as gentle rather than sparkling, edges blurred, colours subdued, reflections pooling on footpaths.\n\nDress in light layers and a rain shell, with shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles and a small umbrella for the unhurried intervals between drops. It\u2019s a good morning for a quiet coffee by a window, a tidy-up of the week\u2019s loose ends, or a short, rain-dappled walk to reset the senses; later, if the ceiling lifts, a quick errand run or a browse through the shops will suit the soft light. The air will feel pleasant rather than bracing, the kind of weather that invites you to keep the pace measured and your plans flexible.",
