    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this evening, the air carries an inviting clarity, illuminated by a waning sun leaving a soft glow across the skyline. The temperature dances around a comfortable 50 degrees, complemented by a refreshing north wind whispering through the streets, sweeping away any remnants of the day's heat. As night unfurls, the clouds gather gently, partly obscuring the night sky, but no marine layer encroaches upon the horizon, allowing for a delightful view of the city lights twinkling like scattered stars.\n\nAs you embrace the evening, consider layering a light jacket over a simple sweater\u2014it will be a perfect companion for the brisk breeze. This pleasant weather invites a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 tucked away in one of the city\u2019s charming corners. With a clear sky above and vibrant city life below, it's a perfect moment to enjoy a warm drink and watch as the city settles into nighttime, each passerby a story waiting to unfold.",
