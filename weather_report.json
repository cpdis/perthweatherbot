    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Subiaco, the sky remains crystal clear, painting an unobstructed azure dome above the roaming streets and quiet homes below. The sun has already bid the day farewell, slipping below the horizon, but the warmth of its recent embrace still lingers in the air. The absence of clouds during the day suggests a scintillating sun that bathed Subiaco in a generous blanket of light, allowing for a perfect dance of shadows and highlights across the urban landscape. With the descending twilight, the comforting drop in temperature offers a gentle invitation to unwind outdoors. It's the kind of evening that whispers promises of contentment and invites introspective strolls or queries beneath the emerging constellations. As the night enfolds the city in its soft, cool hue, a light cardigan might suffice for those venturing into the inviting balm of the evening air. It's a serene time to indulge in a meditative walk, savoring the subtle whispers of the evening breeze, or perhaps to settle on a patio and engage in the quiet reverie of watching the stars blink into existence. The tranquil clarity of the day gives way to an equally subdued night, making it an ideal backdrop for quiet conversations or solitary musings. As the city drifts into its nocturnal rhythm, Subiaco seems to pulse with an understated vitality, offering a peaceful, almost poetic evening to its inhabitants.",
