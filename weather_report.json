    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, the stage is set for a nighttime drenching, with rain starting to make its presence known. The skies are enveloped in a thick blanket of clouds, and a strong south wind stirs, carrying hints of moisture that promise an evening of rhythmic rainfall. With temperatures hovering around the low fifties, they\u2019re expected to gently rise through the night, enveloping the city in an uninviting coolness. The likelihood of precipitation lingers at a resolute 100%, heralding the arrival of significant rainfall\u2014between one to two inches\u2014transforming the ordinary hustle into a damp spectacle.\n\nTomorrow dawns with continuing rain into the morning, punctuated by sporadic thunderstorms that will dart through the clouds, giving way to a series of showers throughout the day. The air will retain that coolness, settling in the mid-fifties as it seems to conspire with the gray sky overhead to remain hushed and introspective. Fog may creep in from the shoreline, snuggling closely along the bay while the gusty winds continue to whip through the streets, ideal for those who savor the promise of a cozy indoor retreat. For those who must venture out, layers will be the key: a warm, waterproof jacket over a sweater, sturdy shoes fit for puddle-hopping, and perhaps an umbrella to ward off the early bursts of nature's shower. As the currents of time swirl in this atmospheric melody, a perfect refuge awaits with hot coffee in hand, where one may reflect or read, letting the rain's symphony fill the backdrop of the day.",
