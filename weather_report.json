    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the night air carries a gentle chill, wrapping the city with the soft touch of late autumn. The forecast speaks of partial clouds tonight, creating a delicate interplay between the moonlight and the shadows cast by the nearby hills. A low in the upper 40s fosters a serene and cool atmosphere, inviting residents to don layers that strike a balance between warmth and comfort. The faint breath of the west wind, whispering at 2 to 6 mph, adds a soothing cadence to the evening.\n\nTomorrow promises a shift in tone, as the sun unfurls its rays over the landscape. Anticipate a day dominated by blue skies, with a high reaching into the low 60s. However, as afternoon approaches, temperatures are destined to ease down into the upper 50s, perhaps urging locals to enjoy the midday sun and then retreat into the embrace of a light jacket or sweater as evening falls. With the marine layer lingering at bay, fog will remain a distant memory for the time being, allowing for unobstructed views of iconic landmarks. This is an ideal day to explore the charming streets of the Mission District or sip on a warm drink at a cozy caf\u00e9 while watching the world wander by, all while the city paints itself anew under a brightening sky.",
