    "weather_report": "The weather in Downtown San Francisco today reveals a scene bathed in sunlight, a soft warmth that just teases the early winter chill. With highs hovering around the mid-fifties, the atmosphere promises a brisk but manageable day. As the morning unfolds, the city basks under clear skies, the kind that invites leisurely strolls and quiet contemplations. Wisps of clouds occasionally drift past, but they do little to obscure the beauty of landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge standing proudly against the blue.\n\nThe day progresses with temperatures gently tapering off, so those out and about might consider layering lightly\u2014perhaps a sweater over a simple shirt to fend off the coolness that descends in the afternoon. Evening promises a mild embrace, dipping to a cozy low of forty-eight, perfect for gathering with friends in a warm caf\u00e9 or enjoying a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s tranquil parks. While fog does not shroud the landscape today, remnants of the marine layer are yet visible in the distance, hinting at the dynamic weather patterns that often dance along the Bay. As day turns to dusk, the stage is set for a peaceful evening, ripe for reflective walks or intimate dinner outings as the city lights begin to twinkle like distant stars.",
