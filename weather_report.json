    "weather_report": "This morning in Subiaco, the sky arranges itself in a sparse mosaic of ambient clouds, akin to the scattered thoughts of an old poet. They dawdle across an otherwise undaunted blue, casting their weave of whimsical shade upon the quiet city. From the warmth of a gentle morning sun to the chill still lingering from the night before, the air carries an endearing temperateness. \n\nThe remainder of the day promises a continuation of this motif with intermittent cloud cover and a hint of sunlight playing hide and seek amidst the seafirst skyscape. It is a day where the light lends itself to the subtlety of shadow, yet preserves the unfettered clarity of daylight. A day perfect for donning a light sweater and your favorite book, to enjoy in the peace of an outdoor cafe, watching the world gently go about its business. The weather is as inviting as the soft, gentle verses of a bygone romantic, stirring you to embrace your local surroundings and partake in the slow, steady rhythm of Subiaco in all its tranquil glory.",
