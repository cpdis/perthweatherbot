    "weather_report": "As the sun sinks into the afternoon sky, Downtown San Francisco basks in a cool yet inviting brightness. The air feels fresh, almost invigorating, with temperatures gently sliding towards fifty-six degrees. A gentle north-northeast breeze sways the trees, while the sprawling cityscape remains largely free from the customary fog that often cloaks this part of California. Crispness hangs in the atmosphere, echoing the promise of a night that will envelop the city in a blanket of clouds down to a snug forty-eight degrees.\n\nWith such delightful conditions, it's an ideal moment to meander through the city's streets or perhaps indulge in a quiet caf\u00e9 visit. The visibility is clear; the distant hills and the outline of the Golden Gate Bridge offer a picture-perfect backdrop against the skyline. As dusk approaches, a light jacket or sweater would provide just the right warmth against the cool air, perfect for an evening stroll or catching up with friends over a warm beverage. After all, the city, with its unique blend of charm and bustle, remains ever alluring, especially under such splendid skies.",
