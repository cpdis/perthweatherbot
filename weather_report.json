    "weather_report": "Morning in North Perth arrives under a quilt of broken cloud, the sun showing itself in soft glances that brighten verandas and gum leaves without ever quite taking charge. The day looks gentle but unsettled, with light showers expected to wander in by early afternoon, softening the edges of the skyline and dappling pavements. Even with the cloud, the spring UV will sharpen toward midday, so a hat and sunscreen are still wise companions. Air clarity should remain decent, though the sky will feel brushed in grey-blue tones as the rain approaches.\n\nDress in light layers: a breathable shirt for the warmer pockets of the morning, a light waterproof or compact umbrella for later. It\u2019s a good day for ordinary comforts\u2014an unrushed grocery run before lunch, a library visit, or a lingering coffee by a window while the first drops stipple the glass. If you\u2019re gardening, start early and leave the pruning for a drier hour; a late-morning walk will likely reward you with a few bright breaks before the damp sets in.",
