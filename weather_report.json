    "weather_report": "As darkness drapes itself around Downtown San Francisco, the city immerses in a gentle but persistent rain, moistening the pavements and whispering to those who wander homeward. With temperatures settling to a cool 51 degrees, the air carries the fresh scent of rain, mingling with the slight chill from the southeast winds that brush past, occasionally stirring a sense of urgency in the evening. The forecast promises more of this consistent patter, a steadfast companion for the night ahead, and as the hours unfold toward dawn, those planning to venture out will find the world cloaked in a grayish haze, an ethereal veil concealing the more distant sights beyond the glimmering city lights.\n\nTomorrow will unveil a similar fate; the clouds will not part, keeping the golden sunlight tucked away for another day. The temperatures will meander around 56, urging residents to wrap themselves in layers \u2014 perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a water-resistant jacket \u2014 to stave off the chill and dampness. With visibility likely compromised by a thick marine layer, one might consider indoor pursuits; perhaps exploring the quiet charm of a local bookstore or gathering with friends over steaming mugs of coffee, engaging in conversations that tend to meander like the rain itself. As the evening progresses, this weather presents an intimate backdrop, perfect for enveloping oneself in the warmth of home or the soft flicker of candlelight in a neighborhood caf\u00e9, where the world outside is only a distant rumble of rain and the stories unfold softly within.",
