    "weather_report": "In the pre-dawn hours of Subiaco, a serene spectacle of soft light has begun to emerge, while the quiet presence of scarce puffs of cloud hover gracefully in the sky, appearing like pieces of cotton tossed by a whimsical child onto the ethereal plain. As night slowly withdraws, the sky remains, for the most part, unblemished, implying the promise of an amiable day ahead, marked by modest warmth and a soothing gentle breeze. \n\nSubiaco prepares herself to welcome the day, a soft shawl of sunlight tinged with the blush of morning draped across her. The temperature will be pleasantly mild, ideal for lightweight layers to embrace the touch of the sun. A day well suited for a sun-kissed stroll in the park, or a contemplative bench-rest beneath the tender shade of a tree nearby. As the clarity of the day emerges from the depths of night, the humble song of daily life will resume, resonating harmoniously with the radiant symphony of our celestial sphere. Ultimately, it will be a day as beautifully ordinary as the secret rhythms of life that shape us and the world we inhabit.",
