    "weather_report": "As the drowsy sun bids farewell over Subiaco, the sky remains clear, like a vast, silent canvas of potential. Without a cloud in sight, the horizon whispers tranquility to those seeking solace or recreation in these languid afterhours. Today has unfolded like the perfect summer novel, with the fireball of the sun marking its narrative arc across an azure dome, ensuring the day was often too bright for any unprotected soul. The later hours, however, bring a comforting cool as the warmth recedes gently. Anyone stepping into this soft and forgiving evening would find it wise to wear something light but keep a sweater at hand for when the night gently asserts itself. \n\nThe lack of clouds tells tales of crystalline starlight to come, inviting leisurely strolls where thoughts can float unburdened. The absence of the sun's harsh gaze beckons outdoor diners or those longing to sit awhile in nature with a favored book or a companion for good company. With this celestial clarity above, it's an evening for reflection and ease, where the world seems momentarily suspended in serene balance. The day has closed but promises the nightlife of celestial hosts, inviting the inner musings of all who venture under the star-lit fabric of night.",
