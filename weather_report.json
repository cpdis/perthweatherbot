    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a rinsed-blue morning, the light already clean and decisive. The forecast holds steady with clear skies through late morning and into the afternoon, so expect a bright, unbroken sun and a day that sharpens colors and edges. Clarity will be excellent; haze kept at bay. By midday the sun will bite a little, with the UV likely rising from gentle to fairly insistent, the kind that asks you to mind the clock if you linger outdoors.\n\nDress in light layers you can peel back, with sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and a sweep of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out around lunch. It\u2019s a fine day for ordinary pleasures: airing the house, walking to the shops, sitting at a caf\u00e9 table that catches the light, or rolling a short errand by bicycle. If you have a quiet hour, a loop through a nearby park or a bit of time in the garden will feel just right before the afternoon grows bright and intent.",
