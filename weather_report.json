The low temperature hovers near 46 degrees, and a soft, whispering wind from the north northeast adds to the delicate chill in the air. The fog remains a specter, not quite present to the eye but dancing lightly at the edges of awareness, suggesting the marine layer lingers nearby\u2014an intimacy between sea and sky that often defines this city.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the promise of sunshine arrives, illuminating the cityscape while the high climbs to a mild 60 degrees. Though temperatures will flirt with the cooler side of pleasant in the afternoon, the warmth of the sun will undoubtedly coax life into the streets. As skies clear, the fog should recede, revealing the renowned vistas of San Francisco, where those iconic hills and landmarks awaken beneath brilliant light. For the evening's festivities, dressing in layers\u2014a cozy sweater under a jacket\u2014will keep you comfortable as you navigate the shifting weather. Consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the surrounding parks. The crisp air and the anticipation of tomorrow's sunlight could inspire a reflective evening or a chance to share a warm drink with a friend as the city unfolds its nighttime tales.",
