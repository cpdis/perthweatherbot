    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into night under a patchwork sky: scattered clouds letting a few brave stars through now, thickening to a gentler, more uniform cover later. Sunshine has left the stage and the UV risk has slipped to nothing; the air feels clear, with the glow of streetlamps softened by the cloud. It\u2019s not a dramatic evening, just a quiet, serviceable one, and visibility should hold steady as the lid of cloud settles in.\n\nDress for comfort\u2014light layers over short sleeves, a cardigan if you tend to chill, and easy shoes. It\u2019s a good time for modest pleasures: a slow walk to fetch dessert, a lap around the block with a favorite song, a tidy of the desk while the kettle murmurs. Cyclists should use bright lights as the ceiling thickens. Tomorrow\u2019s sun will likely share the stage with cloud, so no harsh blaze expected early; for now, enjoy the calm and the gentler edges of the night.",
