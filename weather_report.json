    "weather_report": "As the late afternoon settles over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds drapes the city, rendering the landscape in various muted shades of gray. This overcast sky hints at the ongoing chance of rain that has loomed throughout the day, casting a somewhat melancholy yet contemplative mood. The temperatures are gradually lowering, nudging down from a high of 57 degrees, inviting those outdoors to reach for layers. With winds whispering softly from the south, there\u2019s a coolness in the air that suggests rain may soon kiss the pavement, adding to the fresh scent of moisture that dances just beyond the horizon.\n\nTonight promises similar conditions, with the possibility of rain lingering until the early morning hours. The cool evening will settle into the low 49, perfect for pulling on that cozy sweater or perhaps a light waterproof jacket, embracing the dampness rather than resisting it. While an outing might seem uninviting, there is a serene beauty in the city\u2019s misty silhouette against the lights twinkling in the fog. A stroll through the Arts District may provide a charming perspective, where the quietude invites a pause, perhaps to enjoy a warm cup at a nearby caf\u00e9 or to engage in gentle conversations with friends. Embrace the cozy, reflective nature of the day, for it holds its own delicate charm beneath the clouded canvas above.",
