    "weather_report": "Evening in Subiaco settles in with a fractured ceiling of cloud and a softened, silvery glow from streetlights; any bite from the sun has long gone, and the UV risk is essentially nil. The day has been more matte than glossy, with limited sunshine and a veil of cloud that kept the light diffuse; later tonight the sky leans toward light showers, the kind that darken the pavement and sharpen the scent of gum leaves. It\u2019s a gentle, slightly damp sort of night\u2014pleasant enough if you like a quiet amble, not so kind to bare shoulders or sandals.\n\nDress in light layers and a thin waterproof or compact umbrella, closed shoes to dodge puddles, and you\u2019ll be fine. Good hours for small, ordinary comforts: pick up something warm from a nearby kitchen, flip through a book at home, queue a record or a podcast, tidy the desk for tomorrow. If you need to get out, a short stroll between awnings feels right; watch the reflections gather and let the day exhale.",
