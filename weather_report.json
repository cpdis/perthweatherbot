    "weather_report": "The dark cloak of night lingers over Downtown San Francisco, with the distant sound of raindrops hinting at a gentle awakening. As the clock ticks toward the early morning hours, light rain is poised to grace the city before the sun rises fully\u2014a soothing, almost meditative patter that nourishes the earth and wraps the streets in a delicate moisture. Fog hovers low and content, veiling the iconic silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the city\u2019s skyline, creating an ethereal atmosphere that is quintessentially San Francisco. The chill in the air betrays winter's grip, urging residents to pull on their warmest jackets and perhaps indulge in a cozy scarf; while layers remain wise, perhaps a light rain-resistant coat would serve as both friend and shield.\n\nAs dawn unfolds and clouds cling stubbornly overhead, expect the rain to return later in the afternoon, wrapping the day in a hushed intimacy. The forecast predicts a steady stream of moisture, nourishing the city and transforming the bustling urban landscape into a watercolor of gray and soft pastels. If your day permits, consider wandering through the galleries of the Mission or curling up in a coffee shop along Hayes Valley, where windows offer unlikely glimpses of the shifting light. There is beauty in the obscured world today, a silent reminder that even in haze, San Francisco weaves a story worth savoring.",
