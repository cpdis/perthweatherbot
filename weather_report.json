    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds with a serene clarity, bathed in sunlight and free from the usual fog that tends to cloak the skyline. The air carries a gentle chill, with temperatures likely to drift from a pleasant 63 degrees to a cooler 58 as the afternoon progresses. A whisper of a northwestern breeze adds a refreshing touch, making it a perfect moment to step outside and embrace the day.\n\nAs evening approaches, the city will continue to bask in mostly clear skies, inviting gentle reflections from windows and rooftops as the sun dips lower. With temperatures settling around 49 degrees tonight, layering is advised\u2014perhaps a light jacket to ward off the coolness and a scarf for added comfort. Given the inviting conditions and tranquility of the day, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront could be a delightful way to absorb the fading light, or you might choose to settle into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a warm beverage, allowing the ambiance of the city to wash over you.",
