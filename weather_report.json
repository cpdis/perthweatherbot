    "weather_report": "The morning in Subiaco unfurls itself beneath a sky stitched with a delicate trace of clouds. They sprawl out across the canvas of the dawn sky like downy whispers, scarce enough to allow diamante glimpses of azure to peep through. It is a day ensconced in a soft, mellow light, its brightness dampened by the occasional, gossamer cloud passing across the face of the sun. The sunlight, when it breaches the cloud cover, spills over the cobblestones and ignites the dewy grass with a gentle, refracted radiance. \n\nAs the morning matures towards noon, don't be surprised if the clouds drift away on the silent current of the breeze, making way for a broad, clear sky. The day promises to be balmy, not overly heated or cooled. Dress for a tranquil day; comfortable layers, perhaps a light cardigan to respect the morning's nascent chill. As for the afternoon, a leisurely walk in the parkland, or through the characterful, winding streets of Subiaco, might be a delightful way to enjoy the day. Immerse in the silver-tipped clarity and the amicable warmth of the Subiaco day, a canvas of cloud-smeared cerulean above and the inviting cityscape around, offering an unspoken yet eloquently beautiful serenade of the local weather.",
