    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a quilt of scattered cloud, the sun slipping in and out like a shy accompanist, lending a soft, silvery clarity to the streets. Through late morning and into the afternoon, expect that pattern to hold: bright spells with gentle veils of cloud, the day reading clean and glare-prone rather than murky. UV will rise quickly as the sun climbs, even with the passing cover, so think of shade as a companion rather than an afterthought. It feels like an easy day to be outside in short bursts.\n\nDress for lightness and flexibility: breathable layers, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and sunscreen on the forearms. It\u2019s a good morning for unhurried errands on foot, a quiet browse in a bookshop before lunch, or tending a few plants on the balcony while the light is kind. If you wander to a caf\u00e9, choose the table under the awning and let the shifting sky do the small talk.",
