    "weather_report": "Late afternoon settles over Subiaco with the sun mostly veiled, the light turned to soft pewter under a swelling lid of cloud. Expect an overcast early evening easing to patchier, broken cloud after dusk, with the occasional brighter rift before night takes over. The day\u2019s edges are muted rather than sharp; colors look subdued, the kind of sky that flatters brick and leaf. UV is low now and slipping toward negligible by sunset, so this won\u2019t be a day for sun on the shoulders, more a gentle, dimming glow.\n\nIt feels quietly pleasant, neither harsh nor sparkling. A light layer or soft long-sleeve will suit the evening, with a thin jacket if the breeze noses in. This is good weather for small errands on foot, a slow loop through the neighborhood, or an unhurried stop for an early supper by a window where the street hum drifts past. If home calls, open a book and let the grey light fade around you; the sky will do the rest.",
