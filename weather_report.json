    "weather_report": "Subiaco stirs under a mottled sky, sunlight thinned through broken cloud so the morning looks gentle, edges softened and colors a shade quieter. It isn\u2019t a day of blaze or glare; the sun keeps slipping behind veils, though spring\u2019s UV will still be lively around midday, so treat it with respect. The air has a clear, washed feel without the hard sparkle, a good-light morning with a hint of change waiting in the wings.\n\nExpect patches of brightness through late morning, then light, passing showers drifting in after lunch, just enough to freckle the footpaths and sweeten the breeze. It reads as pleasantly unsettled rather than bleak. Dress in light layers with a compact rain shell, comfortable shoes that won\u2019t sulk at a sprinkle, and keep sunscreen handy for the brighter breaks. If you\u2019re out, run a few errands or linger over coffee beneath an awning before the damp arrives; later, a quiet browse in a bookshop, a loop through the market aisles, or a short train ride with a window seat suits the mood. Keep plans elastic and an umbrella within arm\u2019s reach.",
