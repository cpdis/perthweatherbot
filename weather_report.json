    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity reveals itself, the city lights twinkling against the backdrop of a vast and tranquil sky, where only a whisper of fog stirs at the edges of the bay, hinting at the famous marine layer that may come to visit after midnight. Tonight descends with a crispness that cradles the low temperature around 49, accompanied by a light northwest breeze that dances delicately through the streets. \n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, one can expect a largely sunny demeanor as the sun claims its place over the horizon. The high near 61 will see the afternoon temperatures gently ebb to around 58, inviting San Franciscans to embrace the outdoors. The weather is poised to be quite pleasant, though residents should prepare for a coolness that lingers, best met with layers such as a lightweight jacket or a cozy sweater, perfect for strolling along the waterfront or venturing into the city's vibrant neighborhoods. It's an opportune day for a casual walk through Golden Gate Park, where the crisp air refreshes the spirit, or perhaps some quiet reading in a sun-drenched caf\u00e9, watching life unfurl at its own unhurried pace.",
