    "weather_report": "The night cloaks Downtown San Francisco in a soft, murky blanket, with clouds drifting lazily overhead. The current temperature teeters around the low 40s, accompanied by the promise of rain that will emerge with the dawn. Soon, droplets will begin to fall, marking the onset of a day fraught with showers and the possibility of distant thunder. The east wind whispers gently at seven miles per hour, but soon it will gain strength, adding a damp chill to the morning hours.\n\nAs the sun's hesitant rays mix with the encroaching rain, expect the high of the day to hover near the mid-50s, a gray canvas interrupted by the occasional, fleeting burst of warmth. Dress warmly, perhaps in layers, to fend off the night\u2019s residual chill and the incoming moisture. A sturdy umbrella and waterproof shoes would serve you well, as puddles will soon dot the streets. This is a day for simple, cozy pleasures\u2014perhaps a stroll through one of the city's intimate cafes, where the scent of coffee mingles with the sounds of rain against the window, or a visit to a local gallery, where art offers a refuge from the drumming of the storm. Enjoy the ambiance of the city as it dances between shadows, light, and life, wrapped in a soft embrace of fog and rain.",
