    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Katy with a polished, uncomplicated sky. The day ran bright from morning into midday, the sun steady but, in December, gentler on the skin; the UV would have been modest at noon and quickly softened toward evening. Clarity has been the theme: a dry, see-forever kind of blue by day, turning now to a clean, starlit dome. It\u2019s a calm, cool-feeling night that asks little of you but a breath and a moment.\n\nExpect the quiet to hold, with no clouds to complicate the hours ahead. A light jacket or sweater suits the after-dark air; earlier, a dab of sunscreen would\u2019ve been sensible but not urgent. This is weather for small errands done without hurry, a slow walk with the dog, a few minutes on the porch listening to the neighborhood settle, or a quick check of the holiday lights before turning in. If you look up, the sky rewards the glance.",
