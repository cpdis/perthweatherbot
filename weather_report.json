    "weather_report": "Perth at midday is bathed in clean, uncomplicated light. Clear skies settle in from early afternoon and hold through late day, the horizon sharp and the blue polished to a quiet gleam. The sun feels assertive now; even if the air reads pleasant, the UV will be high, and shade offers an easy reprieve when you want it.\n\nExpect a bright, dry afternoon running into a clear early evening. Dress light and breathable, add a brimmed hat and sunglasses, and give your skin a thoughtful sweep of sunscreen. It\u2019s a day for modest pleasures: a few errands on foot, a gentle loop along the river path, or tending to a couple of plants on the balcony between sips of water. As the light softens toward late afternoon, a slow coffee outdoors or a short, unhurried cycle suits the mood of the sky that keeps its promise of blue.",
