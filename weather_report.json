    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a cool, quiet midnight with a gauzy lid of cloud and a hint of moisture in the air. Toward the small hours the cover hangs on, and by dawn a light, fretful rain is likely to dapple pavements and soften the edges of the morning. It won\u2019t feel sunny early; UV is essentially nil overnight and very low at first light, with anything stronger only if the sky opens later. The world will look a shade muted and reflective, streetlights caught in damp leaves, visibility fine unless you\u2019re walking straight into a shower.\n\nIt\u2019s an unobtrusive sort of weather, neither harsh nor inviting, asking for a light layer and a compact rain shell if you\u2019re out before breakfast, and shoes you don\u2019t mind meeting wet footpaths. These hours suit modest errands: tidying a corner of the house, laying out tomorrow\u2019s bag, catching an early train with a paperback, or slipping to a nearby bakery under the awnings. As the morning develops, keep an eye on the clouds; if they thin, the day may brighten enough for a simple lunch outdoors, sunscreen in the pocket just in case.",
