The temperature rests in the refreshing embrace of 47 degrees, with a soft north wind teasing tree branches and rustling leaves. As dawn approaches, those seeking morning solace might feel the allure of the quieter neighborhoods, where shadows linger beneath the muted glow of streetlights. \n\nWith the sun poised to rise, Sunday reveals itself gradually, promising a tableau of mostly sunny skies\u2014except for the faint hint of a marine layer that may brush the edges of the coastal vista. Temperatures will hover close to 58, easing down to a cozy 56 as the afternoon unfolds. It\u2019s an invitation to wander through the vibrant streets, to sip a warm cup of coffee while admiring the hints of sunlight playing on the city\u2019s iconic architecture. Dressing in layers will be key; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the chill, while a comfortable scarf can provide that extra touch of warmth.
