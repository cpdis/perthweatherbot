    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into the small hours under a quilt of scattered clouds that look set to thicken toward dawn, the moon blurred, the streets a little hushed. The air feels mild to cool and the view is softened rather than sharp, a night made for quiet thoughts and low lights rather than spectacle.\n\nCome morning, the first sun will likely arrive through broken cloud, a gentle, patchwork brightness rather than a blaze. UV is essentially absent now but will climb quickly after sunrise in spring, so plan on sunscreen and a hat if you\u2019re out later. It promises to be a mostly pleasant day, tempered by passing cloud. Dress in light layers: a breathable shirt with a cardigan or light jacket before breakfast, then pare back as the day wakes up. This is good weather for small errands and calm routines: a pre-dawn stroll to the corner for milk, a tidy of the workspace, or a bike ride to pick up fruit once the light evens out.",
