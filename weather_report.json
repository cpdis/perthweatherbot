    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into a cloudless night, the heat of the day loosening its grip as the sky turns inky and uncomplicated. The air feels clean, edges sharp, streets quiet; visibility is excellent and the UV, fierce earlier in midsummer sun, has faded to nothing now. If you step outside, the stars have the stage and the mood is calm rather than cold, a good moment to let your shoulders drop.\n\nThe forecast keeps the heavens clear through late evening and into the small hours, which bodes well for an easy night. Dress in light layers and keep a soft extra layer handy in case the late breeze takes a bite. With the season\u2019s strong sun in mind, plan shade and sunscreen for tomorrow\u2019s errands. For now, this is weather for a slow neighbourhood stroll, watering a few plants, airing the house, or sitting on the veranda with a book while the day\u2019s warmth ebbs away.",
