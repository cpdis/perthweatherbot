    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a calm, pewter sky, the sun more rumor than presence, its light sifted and soft. The day looks set to stay this way\u2014overcast through late morning into the afternoon\u2014keeping shadows short and colors muted, the world rendered in quiet tones. It won\u2019t feel particularly bright, but it will be gentle, with a mild, even coolness to the air. Despite the cloud, the spring UV will still creep up toward midday; not fierce, but persuasive enough to warrant a dab of sunscreen if you linger outdoors.\n\nDress in light layers: a breathable long-sleeve, a soft jacket, shoes made for unhurried wandering. Sunglasses can stay in the pocket unless the ceiling thins. This is a day for simple errands and unhurried pleasures: a coffee on Rokeby Road where the steam curls like a small ceremony; a slow lap through Kings Park\u2019s paths while the city hums in the distance; a browse in a quiet bookshop or the satisfying business of finally mending that loose button. If you\u2019re at home, open a window, put on a record, and let the afternoon drift by in the agreeable hush that only a grey day can provide.",
