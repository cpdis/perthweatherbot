    "weather_report": "Midday on Rottnest arrives with a gentle shimmer: sun working through patchy cloud, the air bright but softened, the horizon a salt-washed line. Expect a little more cloud building into the early afternoon, then easing to a cleaner, scattered sky toward late day, so the light should turn clearer and more golden as the shadows lengthen. UV is high now despite the veils of cloud, moderating later; it\u2019s the sort of day that looks pleasant and stays that way if you respect the sun.\n\nDress in light, breathable layers, a brimmed hat and sunglasses, and carry sunscreen; a light jumper won\u2019t go astray when the sea breeze freshens. It\u2019s a good afternoon for an unhurried spin on a hire bike, a wander along Thomson Bay with a coffee in hand, or a short swim where the water looks settled, followed by a quiet read on a bench with your back to the wind. As the sky clears toward evening, a stroll up to a lookout will reward you with a clearer view and calmer light, the island\u2019s colors tidier and true.",
