    "weather_report": "Mid-morning in West Perth arrives with a clean, lucid sky and a bright, amiable sun. The light has a crisp edge to it, promising a mostly clear day; later, a few stray clouds should wander through without dulling the scene. Expect strong sunshine around the middle of the day with high UV, the kind that warms the shoulders quickly and favors shade when you can find it. Air and visibility feel clear, the kind of clarity that makes colors pop and turns buildings into sharp cutouts against the blue.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant day if you dress for the glare: light, breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen as standard kit. Good hours now for a gentle walk to the shops, a coffee taken on a shaded veranda, or hanging laundry while the sun does the work. If you\u2019re out, a quick lap around Hyde Park before the midday punch will feel just right; after, a window seat for lunch or a bit of reading on a balcony will suit the calmer afternoon light. Keep water handy and let the sun be an accomplice, not the boss.",
