    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere shrouds itself in a gentle veil of fog, clinging close to the ground as if reluctant to part. The gray clouds hang low, a comforting blanket that speaks of the marine layer lingering over the city. The air feels cool, each breath laced with the salty hint of the nearby ocean, while the chance of drizzle teases those who venture outside. Despite the promise of rain earlier in the morning, the city remains mostly cloudy, the sun making shy attempts to break through, hinting at a softer afternoon light.\n\nAs the hours drift by, expect the chill to settle in, with temperatures gently descending to a cozy 54 degrees. A light breeze whispers through the streets, nudging the wisps of fog further away but leaving just enough to maintain a sense of mystery in the air. Dress warmly and wear layers\u2014perhaps a thick sweater beneath a weather-resistant jacket\u2014perfect for an amble along the Embarcadero, where the tantalizing scent of coffee drifts from nearby cafes. This is a day meant for quiet moments, perhaps to explore hidden bookstores or to savor the tranquility of a nearby park, where even the muted sounds of the city seem softened by the fog.",
