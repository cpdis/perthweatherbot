    "weather_report": "Midday drifts in soft and gray over Centennial Park, the air rinsed clean by earlier light rain and the paths stippled with shallow mirrors. The sun keeps to the wings behind a quilt of cloud, offering only a thin, pearly glow; UV feels subdued, likely low to moderate at best. The day\u2019s edges are gentle rather than sharp\u2014trees smudged slightly at a distance, waterbirds making quiet ripples that seem to hush the scene.\n\nExpect on-and-off light showers to linger through the afternoon, with the odd brighter interlude but little outright sunshine. Dress for damp comfort: a light layer under a waterproof shell, sleeves you can push up, shoes that won\u2019t sulk at wet grass. This is a day for unhurried errands through the park\u2014an easy loop around the ponds under an umbrella, a sit on a covered bench to watch the drizzle bead on reeds, a short jog or a few stretches when the rain slackens, a warm drink from a flask while you listen to the softened world go by.",
