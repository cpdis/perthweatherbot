    "weather_report": "As Downtown San Francisco awakens under a canvas of brilliant blue skies, the atmosphere is crisp, adorned with the gentle whispers of a cool north-northeast breeze. The radiant sun graces the city, driving temperatures softly around the low sixties, yet the air retains that signature chill, particularly as the afternoon approaches. This morning\u2019s clarity offers a sharp visual treat, with no conspicuous fog lurking in the distance; the Bay glitters and the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and city skyline emerge with striking definition.\n\nTonight, shadows will stretch as the sun dips below the horizon, giving way to partly cloudy skies and temperatures that will retreat to a cozy fifty degrees. As you plan your day, lightly layered attire will serve you well: a breezy top with a cardigan or light jacket for the cooler moments will be ideal. This invigorating weather invites a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to one of the many local caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee will carry you away. Embrace the day\u2019s simple pleasures, and let the city\u2019s rhythm guide your adventures.",
