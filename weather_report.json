    "weather_report": "In the hushed embrace of the night, the air in Downtown San Francisco feels crisp and clear, whispering of tranquility and freshness. As the city settles into the early hours, the coolness envelops the streets, with temperatures nudging around 42 degrees, hinting at a gentle rise as dawn approaches. The silence is punctuated only by the soft rustling of leaves stirred by a light breeze. Tomorrow promises a sunnier disposition, with the sun poised to reclaim its place in the sky, revealing the beauty of the bay and its iconic bridge.\n\nThe forecast unfolds a day of brightness, a high near 57 degrees, melting away the lingering chill as the sun arches into the afternoon. The winds, delicate at 3 to 7 mph, will brush through the city, inviting residents to shed their layers and appreciate the emerging warmth. With clarity prevailing, today's adventures could lead one to stroll along the Embarcadero, savoring coffee while watching the ferries glide across the bay, or perhaps to the lush gardens of Golden Gate Park, where a leisurely wander may unveil nature awakening from its slumber. Dressing in light layers would be wise, allowing for the transition from the cool morning air to the sunlit afternoon, making it a fine day to explore the textured sidewalks of this vibrant city.",
