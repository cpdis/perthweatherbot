    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the night feels rinsed and metallic, the kind of quiet that carries the scent of wet pavement before the first drops fall. Light rain is expected to wander through toward the small hours and into early morning, softening the edges of streetlights and leaving windows pearled. Skies look stubbornly overcast, so there\u2019s little chance of sun early; clarity will be subdued, with distant shapes smudged by drizzle. UV will be negligible until after sunrise, and if the cloud holds, likely modest through the morning.\n\nPlan for a muted, damp start: a light waterproof or compact umbrella, layers you can peel back, and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. It won\u2019t be unpleasant so much as hushed\u2014good weather for small, methodical tasks and gentle routines. Now is a fine time to set tomorrow\u2019s bag by the door, soak oats, or line up a playlist for the commute; if you\u2019re awake, a short, hooded stroll under awnings can be quietly restorative. In the morning, expect slick roads and soft light; duck between showers for errands, or keep work close to home and let the day unfold in its grey-blue tempo. If the clouds fracture later, take brief advantage of any pale sun, but don\u2019t count on it.",
