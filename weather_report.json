    "weather_report": "This evening in Downtown San Francisco welcomes a blanket of mostly clear skies, inviting the cool tranquility of the night, with temperatures dipping to a brisk 44 degrees. A gentle northwestern breeze will waft through the streets, adding just a hint of freshness to the air. As the sun rises tomorrow, the promise of a sun-drenched M.L. King Jr. Day emerges, bringing warmth that will peak near 60. Yet, as the afternoon progresses, temperatures will subtly recede to a cooler 58, while the northeast winds begin to animate the day, likely rustling the palms along the waterfront.\n\nTonight, the visibility is notably clear, granting city-dwellers an unobstructed view of the starry heavens. As dawn breaks, the clarity will hold, providing an ideal setting for long walks along the Embarcadero or a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit in a sunlit spot. For appropriate attire, layering is advisable; a light jacket will serve well in the evening chill, but come midday, a simple long-sleeve top should suffice to enjoy the sun's embrace. These temperate conditions beckon a stroll through the city's vibrant neighborhoods, perhaps enjoying an art exhibit or savoring a quiet moment in Baker Beach\u2019s beauty as the sun casts its golden glow over the bay.",
