    "weather_report": "Before dawn at Perth Airport the rain has set a quiet rhythm, beading on windows and turning the tarmac into a dark mirror. Light showers give way to steadier rain toward breakfast, and the sun will be more rumor than presence this morning, with a low, pewter sky and softened horizons. UV stays low at this hour and, with winter\u2019s grip and thick cloud, is unlikely to bite much even if the ceiling lifts for a brief pale patch later. Expect a muted, grey clarity rather than crisp detail, the kind of morning that keeps colors close to the ground.\n\nDress in easy layers with a waterproof shell and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles; a hood is better than juggling an umbrella in passing showers. This is weather for unhurried errands and small rituals: a longer coffee at the terminal cafe, a quiet chapter while you wait, tidying up your travel list, or a short, brisk walk under awnings between breaks in the rain. Keep plans flexible and your expectations of sunshine modest.",
