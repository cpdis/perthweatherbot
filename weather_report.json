    "weather_report": "Adelaide sits under a soft, pewter sky at midday, the sun reduced to a pale coin that peeks and retreats behind thickening cloud. The day feels hushed and cool, with clarity turned down a notch; edges blur, colors lean toward slate and eucalyptus. Light rain is expected to drift in through the afternoon and linger toward evening, so any brightness will be fleeting. UV will be on the low side for this time of year, kept in check by the cloud, making the light gentle rather than sharp.\n\nIt\u2019s a quietly pleasant day to begin with, sliding toward damp. Dress in layers with a light waterproof on top and shoes that don\u2019t mind wet pavements; tuck a small umbrella into your bag for later. If you\u2019ve errands or a short walk in the parklands or along the river, steal that time now, then let the rain nudge you indoors\u2014perhaps a slow browse at the market, a calm hour at a gallery, or the kind of desk task that pairs well with the sound of drops stippling the window.",
