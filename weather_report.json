    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a clear, uncomplicated sky and the kind of calm that lets sound travel. The air feels clean and steady, visibility is crisp, and with the sun long gone the UV is essentially nil; earlier today it would have been assertive under this sort of cloudless dome. It\u2019s a pleasant night to move unhurriedly, the kind of weather that invites you to leave the windows cracked and let the rooms breathe.\n\nThe forecast holds to clarity through the late hours, and if this pattern lingers into morning the sun will arrive unhindered and bright, the UV climbing quickly once it\u2019s up. For now, short sleeves are fine, with a light layer handy if you plan to linger. Slip on comfortable shoes and take a quiet lap to the corner shop, water the garden, or sit on a small balcony with something cool and unpretentious. If you\u2019re thinking ahead to an early errand tomorrow, keep a hat and sunscreen within reach; otherwise, enjoy the uncomplicated grace of a clear night that asks very little and offers a lot.",
