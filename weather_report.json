    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a lucid, blue morning\u2014sun already bright, the air clear as glass. Expect the light to stay generous through late morning, with a few scattered clouds drifting in later, more brushstrokes than cover. UV will ramp up quickly toward midday, the kind that asks for respect even when the breeze feels kind; visibility looks excellent, and the day reads as fair and uncomplicated.\n\nDress for ease: breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen you actually reapply. It\u2019s a good day to walk your errands while the sun is still low, linger over a midmorning coffee in the shade, hang a load of washing that will dry in no time, or take a gentle lap through the park before the afternoon glare settles in. If you\u2019re heading out after lunch, seek pockets of shade and carry water; the light will remain friendly, but it has a firm handshake.",
