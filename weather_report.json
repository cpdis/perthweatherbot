    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a curtain of rain settles in, painting the city with a glistening sheen under the streetlights. The air, cool and crisp with temperatures dipping to around 47, carries the unmistakable scent of wet pavement, a reminder of the moisture that is about to intensify through the night. With a consistent southeast breeze whispering at 7 mph, the rain promises to persist, offering a blend of calm and contemplation for those indoors. \n\nTomorrow dawns with an unyielding forecast, signaling continued rain and a high near 56, shrouded in the familiar embrace of cloud cover. Visibility may be less than clear, with the marine layer rolling in as fog dances along the edges of the Golden Gate, obscuring the familiar sight of the bridge against the darkened sky. It is a time for layering\u2014an insulated jacket, perhaps, with a vibrant scarf to brighten the mood and fend off the chill. Invitingly, the weather sets the stage for simple pleasures: curling up with a good book at a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while watching the world move soggily outside, or wandering through the quiet streets, where the ambiance is softened by raindrops. Each quiet step through the rain-soaked city reveals the elegance of San Francisco\u2019s resilient spirit beneath the clouds.",
