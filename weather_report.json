    "weather_report": "Evening in Subiaco settles in with a cool hush; clouds are gathering and the air feels a touch heavier, the kind that carries the scent of wet asphalt before the first drop. Sunshine is done for the day and the UV is essentially asleep; later tonight a light rain is likely to brush through before easing toward broken cloud in the small hours. The sky will be muted rather than clear, streetlights wearing soft halos and edges blurring at the margins.\n\nIt\u2019s a night made for comfort: a light jacket with a hood or a compact umbrella if you\u2019re stepping out, shoes that won\u2019t mind a damp footpath, and an easy layer beneath. Pleasant in a quiet, inward way\u2014less for lingering outdoors, more for small rituals. Bring in any washing before the spritz arrives, tidy the bag you\u2019ll carry tomorrow, queue a gentle record, or simmer something simple on the stove. If you need a breath of air, a short loop round the block under the awnings will do, letting the town exhale around you while you think about nothing in particular.",
