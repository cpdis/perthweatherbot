    "weather_report": "Fremantle sits under a rinsed, midnight-blue sky, the air quiet and a touch salty, as if the ocean were whispering from just down the street. Stars are sharp and steady; the night feels open and uncomplicated. Toward dawn the horizon will pale cleanly, and the day looks set to run bright and cloudless. Expect a sun that wakes fast and means business; the UV will surge quickly after breakfast, the light turning crisp enough to make colors ring.\n\nIt will feel kindest in the early hours, so dress with a light layer now, then shift to breezy fabrics with a hat, sunglasses, and unapologetic sunscreen once the sun lifts. A glass of water by your side won\u2019t go astray. If you\u2019re up, step outside for a quiet look at the stars; at first light, a gentle walk to the bakery or a spin along the river will be lovely before the glare arrives. Hang a wash early to drink the morning, run errands before midday, then retreat to shade for a book or an unhurried lunch while the afternoon sea breeze, if it stirs, takes the edge off. As evening leans in, the sky should clear again for an easy stroll and a soft landing to the day.",
