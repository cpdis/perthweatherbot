    "weather_report": "As dawn softly unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds hangs in the sky, casting a gentle shade. The coolness of the air is palpable, with temperatures hovering around the low fifties, while a moderate breeze from the west southwest carries hints of moisture. As the afternoon approaches, expect the sun to briefly peek through, illuminating the city with pockets of warmth before the rain arrives. By late afternoon, the sky will darken as the forecasted rain makes its entrance, promising to paint the city with a fresh sheen. \n\nThe prevailing marine layer could present a lingering mist, softening the outlines of iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, draping them in an ethereal haze. It may not be the sun-drenched day one might yearn for, yet there\u2019s a quiet charm in the muted palette of the landscape. Dressing in layers will be most prudent; a light jacket to fend off the briskness, coupled with a waterproof layer as the promise of rain becomes reality. As the day unfolds and the clouds roll in, consider a leisurely stroll through the whimsical streets, perhaps indulging in a cozy caf\u00e9 where you can savor a warm drink while the world outside embraces the rhythm of rainfall.",
