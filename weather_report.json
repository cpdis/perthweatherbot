    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Flinders Park, the sky feels heavy and close, the sort of night when the air already tastes of wet pavement. Showers are expected to slip in toward the small hours and gather into a steadier rain near dawn, ushering in a pewter morning with little in the way of sunshine. UV exposure will be low early and only modest later if the cloud deck thins. Expect a soft-edged day rather than a crystalline one, with distances slightly smudged by passing rain and a lingering, reflective dampness.\n\nDress for patience: a waterproof outer layer, a hood or compact umbrella, shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and a warm middle layer for the winter chill. It\u2019s a good morning for quiet, ordinary rituals\u2014clearing a few emails before breakfast, giving the plants a careful drink indoors, or walking to the corner cafe between showers\u2014saving anything that needs bright light or dry ground for later if the sky relents.",
