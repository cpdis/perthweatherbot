    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the delicate haze that enveloped the city earlier in the morning begins to dissipate, giving way to a mostly sunny day. The air carries a crispness typical of December, a soft reminder of the invigorating charms of this coastal haven. While temperatures reach a high of around 62, they will gradually drift down to a cooler 57 by afternoon, inviting a cozy knit or light jacket to accompany both the strolls and the occasional chill of the breeze fluttering from the north-northwest.\n\nThroughout the day, the clarity will improve, lifting the ethereal veil of marine layer that lingers over the horizon, hinting at the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. As evening approaches, partly cloudy skies may stir up romantic possibilities, with temperatures dipping to about 47. The calm whispers of the south wind at 1 to 5 mph will encourage one to venture out, perhaps to explore the pedestrian paths that weave through the parks or engage in quiet conversations over warm beverages at a nearby caf\u00e9. Today holds a quiet beauty, a reminder to embrace simplicity in the ebb and flow of city life.",
