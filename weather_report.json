    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives without embellishment: a clean, unbroken sky and decisive, short shadows. The air feels simple and dry, visibility razor-clear; the sun has that insistent presence that paints colors hard and bright. UV is fierce under this polished blue, the sort that asks for a brimmed hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a light long sleeve if you plan to linger.\n\nThe afternoon holds steady and uncomplicated\u2014more clear sky, more gleam\u2014easing only toward early evening. It\u2019s pleasant if you respect the glare: breathable fabrics, open shoes, a bottle of water close at hand. This is a good day for unrushed errands under the shopfront awnings, a quiet browse in a cool bookstore, or an iced coffee in a shaded courtyard. Save the garden watering for dusk, let the house air out, and when the light softens, take a gentle loop around the block to watch the day fold itself neatly away.",
