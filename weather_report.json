    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a polished blue, the kind of clear sky that sharpens shadows and makes leaves sing a brighter green. By mid-morning the sun feels purposeful rather than punishing, the air dry and clean, and the day already carrying that summer hum that lifts the mood and quickens the step.\n\nExpect the clarity to hold through early afternoon with brilliant sunshine and little to disguise it; the UV will climb to very high levels around midday, so treat the light with respect. Dress in airy fabrics, a wide-brim hat, strong sunglasses, and don\u2019t skimp on sunscreen. This is a good morning for modest errands on foot, hanging a fresh wash to dry, or lingering over a coffee in a shaded courtyard. If you\u2019re out near noon, keep it brief and keep water close; the day is attractive but unsentimental. As the angle of the sun softens later on, a quiet loop around the block or a visit to a bookshop will match the mood.",
