    "weather_report": "Bend wakes to a quiet, pre-dawn hush, the air likely crisp and the sky largely untroubled. Through the morning, expect plenty of sun with a few light clouds drifting by, the light clean and far-seeing, shadows long and blue. The UV stays low in this winter angle, more a gentle gleam than a burn, but bright enough to warrant sunglasses once the sun clears the rooftops. It looks like a calm, pleasant day, especially in the first half: bundle up in layers with a warm coat, knit cap, and gloves now, then ease the scarf by late morning as the chill loosens. Good hours for modest errands, a slow walk after sunrise, a table by a bright window with coffee, or tending to small tasks in the garage with the door cracked to the clear air.",
