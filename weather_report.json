    "weather_report": "As the night drapes its velvet curtain over Downtown San Francisco, a serene clarity settles in, punctuated by the glimmer of city lights against the canvas of darkness. Tonight, temperatures will gently descend to a mild 49, with a whispering north wind that barely rustles the leaves. The air is crisp, holding the very essence of winter's embrace while remaining distinctly San Franciscan\u2014inviting yet cool.\n\nTomorrow promises to dawn with the warmth of the sun, wrapping the city in a soft, golden glow. Expect a pleasant day with a peak temperature that will hover around 63 before easing into the cooler afternoon, where a touch of the marine layer may kiss the views from the Bay Bridge to the Pacific. Dress in layers: a light sweater or jacket will suffice to chase away any lingering chill. This is the perfect weather to take a relaxed stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping to savor a warm coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or indulge in the vibrant arts scene that seems to pulse through the streets at every turn. The day beckons for quiet enjoyment, an opportunity to embrace the beauty of the moment as the city vibrates quietly beneath the shifting skies.",
