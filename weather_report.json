    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere hangs heavy with anticipation of the rain promised by the day\u2019s forecast. The sky is draped in a blanket of gray, hinting at the approaching storm, yet there\u2019s an unsettling beauty in the contrast of the city lights glimmering through the thickening clouds. With temperatures slipping into the low fifties, the air feels crisp and carries a moist chill, a herald of winter\u2019s grasp that creeps closer with each hour. \n\nTonight promises a relentless rain, with a 90% chance ensuring a solid drenching. For those venturing out, a light jacket layered over a warm sweater would be prudent, offering a touch of comfort against the damp wind. An evening walk along the waterfront could feel refreshing, yet one might also seek the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of coffee complements the melody of raindrops tapping against the windows. Whatever your choice, be mindful of the moisture in the air and the fog that may linger, reminding us of San Francisco\u2019s unique charm\u2014a city that wears its shrouded mystery like a second skin.",
