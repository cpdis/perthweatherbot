    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a damp hush; the sky is quilted in cloud and the first light showers are poised to arrive before midnight, softening edges and laying a dark shine on the streets. Sunshine is done for the day and the UV is effectively nil, with clarity slipping from crisp to gauzy as drizzle thickens and distant lights halo in the mist. Expect the rain to linger into the small hours, more nuisance than drama, enough to scent the air and quiet the footpaths.\n\nIt\u2019s a night for a light waterproof, closed shoes, and perhaps a small umbrella rather than heavy armor; the air feels cool rather than cold, but the damp will find you if you linger. Consider errands that keep you close to awnings, a slow tram ride and an unhurried supper, or heading home to clear a drawer, prep tomorrow\u2019s lunch, and let the rain do the talking at the window. Roads will be slick; walk and drive with a little patience, and save any plans that require sunshine for morning.",
