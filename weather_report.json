    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco opens with a sky of broken clouds, the sun slipping in and out like a shy performer behind the curtain. Light is gentle for now, but spring UV can still assert itself by late morning, even when the sun is filtered, so expect a day that feels bright without being glaring. The air reads as clean and temperate, the horizon tidy, with a patchwork of shade and silvered light likely to continue into early afternoon; a day of intervals rather than drama.\n\nDress for easy movement: a breathable shirt, a light layer tucked in your bag, sunglasses, a hat, and a stripe of sunscreen. It\u2019s the sort of weather that invites small errands on foot\u2014return a library book, pick up herbs from the grocer, linger by a caf\u00e9 window and watch the light change on the pavement. If you\u2019re at home, put a load of washing on the line early to catch those sunnier spells, then take a quiet stroll when the clouds thin.",
