    "weather_report": "The air tonight in Downtown San Francisco carries a gentle clarity, a tranquil banishment of the fog that so often dances and swirls through this city\u2019s embrace. There\u2019s a coolness settling in, promising comfort with a low around 51. A light northeast wind whispers through the streets, inviting moments of stillness under a canopy of stars.\n\nTomorrow promises a sunlit enveloping warmth, a kind of day that inspires leisurely strolls along the waterfront or serene moments spent in the city's parks. With highs near 67, yet easing into the afternoon chill, dressing in layers would be prudent\u2014a soft sweater or light jacket will make for an ideal companion as the sun dips lower and the shadows stretch. The absence of fog allows the golden hues of the day to shine vividly across the skyline, a canvas perfect for a quiet cup of coffee at a neighborhood caf\u00e9 or the soothing rhythm of a walk along the Embarcadero, where the water\u2019s edge reflects the gentle play of the sun. As evening falls, a cozy gathering with friends or a peaceful moment nestled in your favorite nook seems fitting, celebrating the clear night that lies ahead.",
