    "weather_report": "Cottesloe wakes to a flawless, enamel-blue sky, the light already crisp and insistent by mid-morning. The forecast holds this clear stretch through the heart of the day, promising brilliant sunshine and sharp horizons with almost no cloud to soften the glare. Expect the UV to surge to very high, even extreme levels around midday; the kind of sun that looks beautiful and feels unforgiving if you linger in it. It\u2019s a day that will feel bright and buoyant in the shade, a touch harsh in the open.\n\nDress for ease and reflection: airy fabrics, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and proper sunscreen; carry water and don\u2019t be shy about the long shadow of a tree or awning. Run simple errands or take a gentle spin to the shops before the sun peaks; later, let the afternoon drift by with a book on a quiet veranda, a slow sort-through of the pantry, or a coffee in a cool corner. If a sea breeze stirs later, a short, unhurried walk will feel just right.",
