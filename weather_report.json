    "weather_report": "Past midnight in Subiaco, the air feels hushed and heavy with cloud, the kind of sky that mutes the streetlights and makes the roofs listen. Forecast hints at light rain slipping in during the small hours and lingering toward dawn, so expect a soft patter on windows and slick roads at first light. Sunrise should arrive veiled, more pewter than gold, with the day\u2019s clarity subdued by low cloud and misted drizzle. There\u2019s no sun to speak of now and the UV is negligible; after breakfast, if the cloud breaks even a little, spring light can turn assertive quickly, so keep sunscreen in mind despite the grey.\n\nIt looks like a gentle, damp start rather than a washout. Dress in layers, a light rain jacket and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, with an umbrella for the amble to the train or the corner bakery. If you\u2019re awake, this is good weather for a quiet chapter, a tidy of the desk, setting out tomorrow\u2019s coat by the door. After dawn, consider errands close to home, a coffee under the awning, or a short walk between showers to enjoy the cool, clean smell of streets just rinsed.",
