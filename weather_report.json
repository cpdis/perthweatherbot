    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into evening beneath a flawless dome, the last ember of daylight gone and a lucid ink-blue taking its place. The air feels gentle rather than cold, the kind that invites a slow amble after dinner; the sky is clean and open, with stars beginning to stand at attention. UV is essentially nil now, and the day\u2019s hard glare has folded itself away, leaving a calm, unhurried clarity.\n\nThe forecast keeps it simple: clear through late evening and into the small hours, a pleasant close that cools bit by bit. Dress light with a spare layer in reach \u2014 a cotton shirt, sleeves you can roll, and easy shoes. These are good hours for a quiet loop around the block, an unhurried chat on the veranda, or jotting tomorrow\u2019s list by an open window while the night air drifts through. When the sun returns it will do so cleanly, with a bright, honest light and a UV that wakes quickly, but for now the town breathes easy.",
