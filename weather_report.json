The air feels cool, a precursor to the day ahead, with temperatures hovering just above 50 degrees. The city, shrouded in a mottled gray, whispers of a transition from night to day, yet the promise of warmth lingers in the lightening sky. A slight north wind stirs, breathing life into the stillness, but the overall atmosphere remains tranquil and inviting, hinting at the sun\u2019s burgeoning presence below the clouds.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, expect splashes of sunshine to pierce through the haze, revealing the city in a tapestry of muted colors. While the high will reach around 62 degrees, a subtle cooling in the afternoon will take place, as temperatures retreat to about 57. With the haze dissipating and sunlight becoming more prevalent, anticipate a pleasant shift, perfect for enjoying a leisurely stroll through the park or a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit. Light layers will serve you well today\u2014a sweater paired with a light jacket should be ideal, providing both comfort and ease. A morning coffee on a cozy patio or an exploration of hidden alley art may suit one\u2019s fancy, capturing the understated beauty of a typical San Francisco day that is both refreshing and inviting.",
