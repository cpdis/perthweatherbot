    "weather_report": "As the afternoon wears on in Downtown San Francisco, rain begins its steady embrace, transforming the city into a symphony of muted grays. The high temperature barely brushes against fifty-five degrees, trailing downward as the clouds gather their full weight. The air feels thick, heavy with impending moisture, and the soft whispers of damp winds drift through the streets. Visibility is just shy of clarity; the iconic Golden Gate Bridge stands shrouded, edges blurring into the horizon. The persistent drizzle will soon escalate, with the evening promising an unrelenting downpour, peaking at nearly two inches. \n\nFor those braving the elements, dressing for warmth and resilience is paramount\u2014think layers, sturdy waterproof footwear, and a trusted umbrella. As the day fades and the rain intensifies, consider cozying up at a quiet caf\u00e9, sipping on something warm while the world outside transforms into a watercoloured portrait. Alternatively, lose yourself in the comforting confines of a bookstore where the sound of each raindrop creates a tranquil backdrop as you explore the pages of new stories. All in all, it\u2019s a day to find solace indoors, luxuriating in moments that invite introspection.",
