    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a hard, polished blue, the kind of cloudless morning that sharpens edges and lifts the mood. The sun is already assertive and will only grow bolder; expect the sky to stay clean and bright through the afternoon, with the UV index ramping quickly to strong, even very high levels by late morning. It\u2019s a lovely, uncomplicated day if you make peace with the glare.\n\nDress for light and shade in equal measure: airy layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and unhurried sunscreen. With the day still young, it\u2019s a fine time to walk for a coffee, linger at a quiet shopfront, hang a load on the line, or take a gentle loop through the park before the noon sting arrives. Save the sun-baked tasks for now and the languid ones for a cool corner later; let the bright hours do their work while you keep to pockets of shade.",
