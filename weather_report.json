    "weather_report": "Subiaco leans into late afternoon under an immaculate, rinsed-blue sky. The day has been all sun, and though the fiercest UV has slipped past, the light still has a bite this hour before softening toward a clear, mild evening. Air feels dry, visibility crisp, and with the sky set to stay cloudless into night, the day closes with a promise of an easy sunset and sharp stars.\n\nDress light and breathable, with a hat and sunglasses if you\u2019ll be out before dusk; carry a light layer for after dark when the warmth loosens its grip. It\u2019s a good time to walk for groceries, water the garden, or sit at a shaded cafe table and let the day unwind. A gentle ride through quiet streets or an unhurried loop around the block suits the mood; if you\u2019ve chores to run, do them now while the sun mellows and the air feels honest.",
