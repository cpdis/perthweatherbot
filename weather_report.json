    "weather_report": "Herdsman wakes to a hard, generous blue, the sun already keen on the skin and the edges of everything etched in crisp relief. The morning is clear and dry, with glare gathering as the hours climb; by late morning through mid-afternoon expect very high to extreme UV under an untroubled sky, the kind of pure light that flatters the lake and punishes bare shoulders. A faint breeze may stir later, but the day reads steady and cloudless, more brilliant than gentle.\n\nThis will feel pleasant in the shade and early, then austere in the open. Dress light and breathable; add a wide-brim hat, sunglasses with conviction, and sunscreen you actually reapply. Carry water, and if you\u2019ll be out for a while, consider long sleeves that float rather than cling. Good hours now for a quick lap around the wetlands, a quiet errand on foot, or hanging the wash where it will dry in no time; save yard work for later or move it indoors when the sun hardens. A coffee by a window works too, letting the radiance be scenery rather than taskmaster.",
