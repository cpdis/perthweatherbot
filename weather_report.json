    "weather_report": "Morning in Katy arrives clear and uncomplicated, the sky mostly open with just a few quiet clouds drifting west to east. Sunlight looks steady rather than harsh, the kind that brightens brick and fence-lines without pressing on the skin. UV is low now and should lift to a modest midday peak; sunglasses and a light touch of sunscreen are sensible. The day looks dry and lucid, with good visibility and little hint of mischief from the weather, a pleasant companion more than a challenge.\n\nDress in easy layers: a soft long-sleeve or light sweater you can peel back as the sun settles in. It\u2019s a fine morning for an unhurried porch coffee, a short neighborhood loop with the dog, or knocking out a couple of errands before the afternoon hum begins. If you\u2019re staying in, crack a window for a few minutes and let the clean air wander through; if you\u2019re out, carry a small water bottle and enjoy the clarity while it lasts.",
