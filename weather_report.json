    "weather_report": "As evening falls over Downtown San Francisco, the air is still and clear, with a gentle warmth lingering from a day suffused with sunlight. Tonight\u2019s low will settle around 52 degrees, embraced by a steady northwest wind that brushes through the streets at 15 to 22 mph, occasionally gusting even higher. There may be a touch of chill in the air, a reminder of the ocean's proximity, but the clarity of the sky, unmarred by fog, hints at a peaceful night ahead.\n\nSunday promises a return to that sunny embrace, with peaks of 68 degrees ushering in a pleasant afternoon, though temperatures will cool slightly, wrapping around 63 as the day winds down. The breeze will persist, nudging you to don a light jacket or sweater should you venture out to enjoy the lingering daylight. With spirits buoyed by this inviting weather, consider a leisurely lunch al fresco at a caf\u00e9 with views of the Bay or perhaps a stroll through the nearby parks, where the city's vibrant atmosphere can be soaked up under blue skies. In this lovely autumn interlude, there's no need for grand adventures; the simple pleasures of the day hold their own charm.",
