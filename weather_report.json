    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a blanket of dense clouds, with rain gently falling and a palpable chill in the air. The high has barely reached 59, with a steady descent toward a twilight low of 54, a reminder that winter\u2019s grip still holds. The winds from the south-southwest lend a brisk edge, presenting gusts that carry whispers of distant storms. Visibility is limited as the city\u2019s skyline is enveloped, the fog creeping low, playfully obscuring the outlines of familiar landmarks.\n\nThe promise of rain lingers, with a robust chance of precipitation continuing into the evening. As such, dressing warmly is imperative, embracing layers that shield against the dampness\u2014perhaps a water-resistant jacket paired with cozy knitwear to ward off the cool. While outdoor pursuits may not beckon today, the ambiance invites simple pleasures\u2014a warm cup of coffee enjoyed in the comfort of a corner caf\u00e9, where the steady patter of rain adds to the cozy atmosphere, or curling up with a book as the city settles in for the night. Evening plans might best be spent indoors, savoring the sounds of the rain in a space that embraces comfort.",
