    "weather_report": "In the quiet hour before dawn, Downtown San Francisco sits serenely under a cloak of clarity. The overnight air, brisk yet invigorating, has permitted a gentle rising of temperatures, showcasing a refreshing break from the chill of night. When daylight breaks, it unfurls to reveal a sunny tapestry of blues and whites adorning the expanse above, while the north-northeast winds whisper softly, caressing the city with a mild touch. As the sun ascends, expect a pleasant high, tempered by the retreat of warmth in the afternoon; the character of the day promises to be inviting, yet reminds one not to disregard the lingering coolness typical of the Bay.\n\nThe absence of fog this morning reveals a landscape unimpeded by the marine layer that often shrouds this iconic locale. With no mist to mingle with the skyline, it is an opportunity to explore the city's nooks and crannies. Layering lightly is advisable\u2014a light jacket will stave off the cool breeze without stifling enjoyment of the inviting sunshine. So, consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the waters shimmer under the sun's embrace, or perhaps visit one of the local cafes to sip on a warm beverage while soaking in the tranquil atmosphere. A day alive with clarity invites the gentle embrace of adventure, beckoning one to savor the ordinary amidst the extraordinary charm of San Francisco.",
