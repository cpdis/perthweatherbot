    "weather_report": "Evening in Subiaco has settled into a soft, dusky blue. The sun is gone and with it any bite of UV; it will stay essentially nil through the night. Clouds are gathering their thoughts, with a brief spell of light rain likely closer to late evening, then thinning toward scattered patches by the small hours. Not a crisp, clear night exactly, but a gentle one\u2014streetlights likely to sheen a little on damp pavement, the sky half-open here and there for a shy star.\n\nIt reads as quietly pleasant if you don\u2019t mind a sprinkle. Carry a light jacket and a small umbrella or hood, and choose shoes that won\u2019t sulk at wet footpaths. If you\u2019re heading out, time a short walk between showers, pick up something simple from the shops, or ride the train a stop or two just to let your mind drift. If you\u2019re staying in, tidy a drawer, water the basil, queue up tomorrow\u2019s to-do list, and call it a night while the air cools and the world goes calm.",
