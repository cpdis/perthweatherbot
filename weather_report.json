    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a cheerful sun, bathing the city in warmth as the temperature charms its way to a pleasant 55 degrees. The northwestern breezes whisper softly at about 9 mph, adding a gentle caress to the otherwise still air. With a clear sky overhead, the visibility stretches out splendidly, allowing the iconic skyline to stand proud against the vast blue, unmarred by fog or the usual waft of the marine layer that often clings to the nearby coast.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the mercury to dip to a comfortable 42 degrees, gradually rising to a mild 44 overnight. The evening looks inviting under the blanket of stars and moonlight, with the cool breeze continuing its serenade. For those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater will serve as the perfect companion, allowing for warmth without bulk. Tonight could be ideal for an unobtrusive stroll through the quieter streets or a relaxed gathering at a local caf\u00e9, where the ambiance hums softly around you. Whatever your plans, the city beckons with a welcoming grace, promising a serene end to the day.",
