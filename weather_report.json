    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a blanket of crisp clarity, the sun gracing the skyline with its gentle warmth. With a high temperature lingering near the chill of 59 degrees, the air is vibrant but carries a slight bite, thanks to a northwest wind dancing around at 14 mph. As the afternoon wears on, the temperatures will settle, allowing a comforting coolness to embrace the city\u2019s streets, making it a perfect day for a relaxed stroll. The forecast carries no hint of fog; today\u2019s sky, rather, offers a canvas of azure that contrasts beautifully against the iconic structures of the city. \n\nAs night approaches, the clear skies will reveal a low near 46, perfect for cozy layers. A light jacket or sweater would serve well, welcoming the evening's slight wind, inviting a sense of comfort as you journey through the bustling downtown. With such delightful weather, consider exploring a quiet caf\u00e9 for a spot of warm tea or coffee, enjoying the ambiance as the city transitions under the stars. Alternatively, a leisurely walk along the waterfront could provide a stunning display of twilight reflections against the Bay, enriching your evening with the soothing sounds of gentle waves.",
