    "weather_report": "West Perth settles into a clear, unhurried night. The sky is scrubbed clean, stars showing like pins in velvet, and the air feels straightforward and honest. There\u2019s no sun now, of course, so the UV is essentially absent; clarity is the headline, with sharp visibility and no hint of haze. It reads as a calm, comfortable evening rather than a sultry one.\n\nThe forecast keeps the canvas cloudless through late evening and into the small hours, so expect a steady, quiet night and a bright, uncomplicated dawn to follow. A light layer will do if you\u2019re stepping out; otherwise, keep it simple and easy. Good conditions for a slow lap around the block, a few pages on the balcony, or watering the plants while the heat has gone out of the day. If you put off an errand, this is a decent window to tick it off without breaking a sweat.",
