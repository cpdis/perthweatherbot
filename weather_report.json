    "weather_report": "As the evening casts its gentle shade over Subiaco, the weather carries a soft, rhythmic melody of drizzle, oscillating between moderate and light rains. The intermittent showers have softened the day, painting the town in hues of refreshing gloom rather than the blistering brilliance of a sunny afternoon. While the sun has long disengaged, the forecast suggests little chance of its bold return before nightfall. Wrapped in a cacophony of pattering raindrops, Subiaco bears a hushed tranquility, where the clatter of the day gives way to a more introspective, contemplative air.\n\nResidents are advised to don their coziest waterproof outerwear\u2014perhaps a beloved raincoat or a sturdy pair of boots, embracing the gentle dampness that surrounds. An umbrella should accompany you as your dependable ally against the elements. The evening is best spent wrapped in the warmth of familiar comforts; perhaps a wander through a bookstore amidst the scent of paper and ink mixed with the earthy aroma of petrichor, or the cozy solace of a local caf\u00e9, where the symphony of rain pairs beautifully with a steaming cup of tea. Subiaco's charm lies in its willingness to slow to a lulling pace, encouraging moments of stillness and introspection in the calming tap of rain; a town that reminds us to relish the beauty of quiet evenings.",
