Sunshine looks unfiltered today; if the clear spell holds, expect a bright, glare-prone morning with crisp visibility over the water and streets. UV will climb quickly after breakfast\u2014typical for this time of year here\u2014so think of the sun as sharp rather than gentle, and plan shade by late morning.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant start for small, quiet errands: a sunrise stroll along the harbor before the day hardens, an early load of washing to catch the first light, a short ride to pick up bread while the air is still kind. Dress light with a breathable layer for the first hour, then shift to a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; carry water and aim for pockets of shade if you\u2019re staying out. If you\u2019re lingering at home, open the windows, water the pots, and let the clear morning do its tidy work.",
