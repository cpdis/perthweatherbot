    "weather_report": "A clear night has carried Swanbourne into a still, inky-blue dawn; stars thinning, the horizon quietly rinsing toward silver. The air will feel crisp on the first step outside, the kind that nudges you to breathe a little deeper. With skies untroubled through the small hours, expect a bright, clean morning once the sun lifts, the light sharp and honest, visibility excellent. UV will stay low for the season, so the day promises sunshine without bite, more glimmer than scorch.\n\nIt looks like a good day for unhurried, ordinary pleasures: a short walk before breakfast to hear the hedges stir, putting a wash on to catch the dry air, or clearing a windowsill to let the low sun warm the room. Dress in layers and a proper coat, with a scarf for that first chill; sunglasses won\u2019t be amiss against the clear-day glare. By midday the light should feel kind rather than fierce, the sort that makes errands easy and a coffee on a bench feel like a small reward.",
