    "weather_report": "As the sun graces Downtown San Francisco this morning, a gentle warmth begins to envelop the city. The air is clear, with only a whisper of moisture lingering from earlier drizzle, now replaced by a soothing brightness as it transitions to a mild and sunny day. With temperatures expected to edge near 62, the northwest winds provide a brisk yet refreshing breeze, making the atmosphere invitingly crisp. Gaze toward the Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin headlands, and you might spot remnants of the marine layer retreating, creating a stunning backdrop against the blue expanse above.\n\nTonight, the tranquility deepens under a clear sky, offering a serene counterpart to the day's vibrancy. With temperatures dipping to around 52, the northwest winds will dance a little stronger, suggesting a cozy layering of clothes might be wise. A light jacket or a sweater would complement your evening stroll or a visit to one of the city's charming cafes. Such lovely weather beckons a leisurely day \u2013 perhaps a quiet walk along the Embarcadero, enjoying the views of the Bay and the ferries gliding by, or savoring a leisurely brunch at a local eatery to embrace the city's unique atmosphere.",
