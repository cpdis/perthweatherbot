    "weather_report": "As the early hours of the morning drift through Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity envelopes the city, with the cool breath of the north wind whispering softly through the streets. The coolness lingers, beckoning the early risers and dreamers alike, with a leisurely low of about 49 degrees. The tranquil early sky unveils a promise of sunshine to come, offering a sense of warmth that cloaks the chill that may linger during the day.\n\nBy midday, expect the sun to reign supreme, casting its golden light over a high reaching near 62 degrees, only to soften to around 60 as the afternoon unfolds. The breeziness nudges at 14 to 18 miles per hour, teasing leaves and hats alike, while occasional gusts awaken smiles across the city. The outlook is remarkably pleasant; the marine layer that often veils the Bay is notably absent, allowing for uninhibited views of iconic landmarks. Clad in layers\u2014a light sweater or a fitted jacket paired with soft trousers or jeans would be ideal\u2014you'll feel comfortable as you bask in the sunlight or step into the shelter of a caf\u00e9 for a warm drink. With such favorable weather, a quiet walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping to savor a pastry, or a serene moment at a local park would beautifully complement the day and its gentle embrace.",
