    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with a clean, unblemished sky. The late afternoon held to the same clarity, and the rest of tonight looks serene and starry, the kind of stillness that sharpens the edges of rooftops and trees. Sunshine was generous earlier; now the UV has fallen to almost nothing, and under these cloudless conditions it will climb quickly again once the sun returns. The air feels composed, visibility is crisp, and the horizon wears a quiet, steady glow.\n\nDress with a little foresight: a comfortable layer or light jacket if you plan to linger outside, adding more if you run cold. It\u2019s a pleasant night for simple things done unhurriedly\u2014an unassuming stroll, a few minutes tending balcony plants, or reading by an open window while the street settles. If a small chore remains, this is cooperative weather to finish it without fuss, then step out for a last look at the clear sky before turning in.",
