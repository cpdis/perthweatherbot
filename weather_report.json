    "weather_report": "The morning air in Downtown San Francisco carries a crispness tinged with impending rain, a whisper of the wetness that will cloak the city later today. Currently, the sky is largely cloudy, framing a muted palette above\u2014a gentle gray that hints at a possible clearing but holds steadfast the promise of showers by evening. While sunlight intermittently filters through, the chill in the air is palpable, suggesting that residents should don layers; a light sweater beneath a well-worn coat will buffer the breeze, and a warm hat will be a welcome companion against the subtle chill.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the temperatures will hover in the low fifties, falling slightly as the sun arcs across the sky before relinquishing its hold to clouds thickening with rain. The brisk south-southwest winds nudge in, heralding the showers expected after the tenth hour. For those undertaking the day outside, the tranquility of a quiet coffee shop beckons with its promise of warmth, or perhaps a leisurely stroll will lead to the discovery of a favorite bookshop, where one might be inspired to settle in with a newfound treasure until the weather shifts. Enjoy the charm of a city poised between the remnants of the holidays and the crispness of winter rain, as San Francisco readies itself for the cleansing embrace of the forecasted downpour.",
