    "weather_report": "Albany wakes under a quilt of unbroken cloud, the morning light sifted to a calm, silvery wash that softens edges and keeps shadows at bay. Sunshine will be scarce; the UV stays muted, more a gentle glow than a glare, and the day looks quiet and matte rather than crystalline. It\u2019s a pleasant sort of gray, steady and unhurried, with clear air but little sparkle, the kind of sky that makes colors on old brick and wet leaves feel deeper.\n\nDress in comfortable layers and a light jacket, something you can keep on indoors without fuss; sunglasses can rest today, but a small tote or foldable umbrella wouldn\u2019t be out of place if the sky toys with a mist. This is good weather for unglamorous errands done at an easy pace, a warm drink by a caf\u00e9 window with a book you\u2019ve been meaning to finish, or a slow neighborhood loop to clear the head. If there\u2019s work to be done, a tidy desk and a faithful lamp will suit the mood, and if not, a grocery run and a pot simmering on the stove may be just the rhythm this gray morning asks for.",
