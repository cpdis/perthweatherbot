    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a curtain of rain graces the city, with the low-hanging clouds wrapping everything in a soft gray embrace. The air carries a chill, promising temperatures that linger in the mid-fifties. Wind dances through the streets, a lively companion at 20 to 23 mph, occasionally gusting stronger\u2014whispers of the storm that is firmly upon us. A 60% chance of precipitation means the city will wear its wet attire throughout the day, with new rain gathering in its folds.\n\nBy midday, the rain won\u2019t relent, nor will the heavy clouds. As the high teeters near 62, the temperatures will slowly wane, folding into a cozy 60 in the afternoon. Those embarking outside should don layers, favoring water-resistant jackets and sturdy footwear to navigate puddles and slick sidewalks. It\u2019s a good day for intimate caf\u00e9s inviting you in with the warm glow of their lights, the soft clinking of cups shared over whispered conversations. Alternatively, meandering through the art-splashed streets or into cozy bookstores could offer refuge from the capricious weather. While the fog may not roll in thick today, the marine layer looms nearby, lending a mystical hush to the backdrop of the city. Embrace the rain; it's well-suited for a comforting, reflective stroll through San Francisco's vibrant soul.",
