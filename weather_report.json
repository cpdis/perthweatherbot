    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the sky presents a quilt of shifting clouds, hinting at the chill that will settle in with the temperature dipping to a cool 49 degrees. A gentle south-southeast breeze, scarcely more than a whisper at 2 mph, stirs the air, lacking the bite that often accompanies this coastal city's evenings. As the night folds into itself, the muted glow of the city lights softly intertwines with the encroaching darkness, offering a comforting, albeit subdued palette of urban life.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, the sun will take center stage, casting its warm golden light over the city, promising a high near 62, though it will retract slightly to around 59 come the afternoon. The north-northeast wind, mild and unhurried at 2 to 6 mph, will complement the clarity of the day, but early risers could still encounter the delicate remnants of a marine layer that might hang close to the coastal edges. For those navigating the day, layering becomes an art\u2014think light sweaters or long sleeves, perfectly paired with breathable fabrics, allowing for comfort amid the transition from the fresh morning air to the sun-dappled noon. It's a day meant for quiet explorations: a stroll along Ocean Beach, a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or a visit to one of the numerous art installations scattered through the city, making the most of both sun and softening shadows.",
