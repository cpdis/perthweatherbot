    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a brilliant blue sky, where the persistent glow of sunshine weaves its warmth into the crisp air, chasing away any lingering traces of the morning fog. With temperatures hovering near a pleasant 68 degrees, the city wears a clear visage, unobstructed by the usual marine layer that often blankets the Golden Gate Bridge. The gentle westerly breeze carries whispers of the sea, inviting a certain buoyancy to the afternoon as you traverse the streets or sip a coffee in a sunlit caf\u00e9.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the sky will transition to hues of twilight, but not before the day settles into a soothing calm, with a comfortable low of around 51 degrees tonight. This crispness in the air calls for layers; a light jacket or sweater will be your reliable companion as the sun bids farewell. While the hours remain inviting, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, watching the ships gently sway in the bay or losing yourself in the bustling market scenes. The absence of fog adds an extra charm to the evening ambiance, making any mundane outing feel refreshingly vibrant.",
