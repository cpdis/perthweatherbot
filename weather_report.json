    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens in Downtown San Francisco, a restless canvas of clouds has settled over the city, hinting at an impending embrace of rain. The thickening atmosphere carries the promise of moisture arriving soon after ten o\u2019clock, wrapping the urban landscape in a hushed blanket of anticipation. The temperatures will hover around a modest 47 degrees, with a gentle breeze whispering from the southeast, suggesting the kind of night that invites cozy layers\u2014perhaps a soft scarf and a well-worn sweater, perfect for the unpredictable heart of winter.\n\nTomorrow, there's no misreading the forecast: full-on rain looms over the city with a 100% chance, accompanied by overcast skies. The sidewalks may glisten with fresh drops, a reminder of nature's breath on chilly days, while the wind stirs in playful gusts between 7 and 10 mph. It calls for thoughtful attire; waterproof footwear and a sturdy jacket will serve well against the chill and dampness. In the face of such weather, one might choose to embrace the warmth of local caf\u00e9s, where the aromas of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods fill the air, inviting solace from the elements. Alternatively, a quiet afternoon browsing through books in a cozy nook could be the perfect antidote to the dreariness, allowing for introspection as the rain gently taps at the windows.",
