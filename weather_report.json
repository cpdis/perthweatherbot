    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush, the sky already swept clear toward dawn, with only a few stray clouds promised to wander in by breakfast. Expect a clean, sun-polished day that grows bright and insistent; the UV will climb quickly and stay fierce through the heart of the day, so think brimmed hat, sunglasses, and unhurried layers that breathe. The air will feel gentle at first light, then warm with purpose, the horizon crisp, colors a little more saturated than usual. It\u2019s a morning for an easy walk under purple jacaranda confetti, for hanging a wash that will dry in no time, for a quick cycle to pick up bread before the glare hardens. As the afternoon glows, work near a window but keep the shade drawn, and if you step out, carry water and a calm pace; later, when the edges soften again, a quiet stroll home will feel like closing a good book.",
