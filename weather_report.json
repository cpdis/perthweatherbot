    "weather_report": "As the night deepens in Downtown San Francisco, the rain falls steadily, shrouding the city in a blanket of clouds and moisture. The air turns crisp, a cool 53 degrees whispering against the skin, while gusts of wind race down the streets, rustling the leaves and creating a symphony of sound. This nocturnal rain, with a 100% chance of further deluge, might bring between half an inch and three quarters of an inch to nearly every corner of the city. The streets, glistening beneath the dim glow of scattered streetlights, offer a reflective beauty amidst the damp.\n\nTomorrow, the city awakens to a continued symphony of rain before 10 in the morning, giving way to showers and perhaps even an electric thrill of thunderstorms in the afternoon. While temperatures will hover around 59 degrees, a gradual descent to 54 will accompany the day, driven by the brisk presence of south-southwest winds. With another inch or two of rainfall expected, this weather calls for thoughtful attire\u2014a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes will serve as both comfort and protection against the elements. Given the conditions, a leisurely morning at a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring the warmth of a favorite brew while watching the rain dance on the window, might be the perfect way to embrace this atmospheric masterpiece. Alternatively, seek the solace of home, wrapping up in a soft blanket with a good book, allowing the rhythms of the rain to lull you into serene contentment.",
