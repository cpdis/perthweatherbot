The skyline is mostly cloaked, a testament to the night\u2019s lingering clouds, which will gradually yield to the sun\u2019s warm caress as the day advances. With a low of around 50, the temperatures hold a briskness, inviting layered attire\u2014perhaps a soft cardigan over a long-sleeved shirt, perfect for the dynamic transition from coolness to the pleasant embrace of the afternoon warmth.\n\nAs the sun rises higher, it promises a sunny day, with a high peeking near 61, just dipping to around 57 in the afternoon. The northeast winds, whispering at 5 to 16 mph, will dance through the streets, occasionally gusting to remind us of nature\u2019s playful spirit. While the morning may hold remnants of marine fog in the distance, it will dissipate, leaving clarity for the urban landscape to shine\u2014a canvas of vibrant city life slowly waking. The day\u2019s charm invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront, where the lapping waves and fresh air become a soothing backdrop to a cup of coffee savored under the sun, offering the perfect balance of warmth and cool breath of the bay.",
