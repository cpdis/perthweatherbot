    "weather_report": "As the final whispers of twilight surrender to the night, Subiaco finds itself under an expansive sky, graced with just a scattering of clouds, like delicate brush strokes over a vast canvas. The day's sun has dipped below the horizon, casting an ethereal glow, yet the memory of its warmth lingers in the mild air. Given the forecast, the earlier sunshine would have been abundant, dressing the town in rejuvenating light and inviting the most nimble shadows to dance on the streets. While the UV index now slumbers, its presence during the afternoon should have been gentle and soft, suggesting a hat and light layers would have sufficed earlier in the day.\n\nThe evening air now feels balmy and balanced, ideal for a light stroll or a gentle pedal on a bicycle through the quiet streets, the perfect antidote to a bustling day. The few clouds above seem to promise a continued blessing of clear skies, enhancing the clarity of the night. The atmosphere feels ripe for contemplation, perhaps with a glass of crisp wine on the terrace, or a casual al fresco dinner, under a blanket of stars. Dressing now means a light jacket or cardigan may accompany your ensemble, offering comfort against the evening's caress, as you lean back and absorb the tranquility of an endearing summer's night.",
