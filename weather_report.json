    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle embrace of patchy fog drapes over the city, with hints of mist weaving through the streets. The current air is cool, touching around 47 degrees, graced by a mild north-northwest breeze that whispers softly, offering a hint of chill. The muted palette of the evening sky hangs low and cloudy, promising a transition into a day where the fog will linger briefly before surrendering to the sun's arrival.\n\nTomorrow, expect the fog to dance briefly before 10 a.m., allowing rays of sunlight to break through, casting a soft glow across the cityscape. With temperatures rising near 58\u2014a delightful break for the chilly evening\u2014the day will gradually cool to around 56 by afternoon. This evolution beckons exploration within the city; perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet afternoon in Golden Gate Park, where one can revel in the serenity of nature awakened by the gentle morning light. Light layers will serve well; a sweater or light jacket will ease the transition from the cool morning air to the warmth of midday. Enjoy the beauty of a Sunday that invites simplicity and calm amid the whispers of fog.",
