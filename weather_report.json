    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the morning begins with a tranquil clarity, a soft whisper before the rain. The sun, though vying for attention, hints at the coolness to come, with temperatures hovering around the upper fifties. There is an unmistakable chill in the air, a reminder that winter is upon us. The Northwest wind, gentle yet persistent, brushes against the skin, urging a light jacket or a cozy scarf\u2014the perfect defense against the encroaching afternoon coolness.\n\nBy late afternoon, expect a transformation as clouds gather, suggesting the first hints of rain after four o\u2019clock. The promise of precipitation looms, with a burgeoning chance of a steady drizzle later tonight, a reminder of the city\u2019s ever-changing moods. As evening approaches, the winds will shift, bringing with them a palpable wetness, blanketing the streets in a gentle mist. Those planning an evening out might opt for an indoor escape\u2014perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 or a spirited conversation at a local pub, where the sounds of laughter and warmth can rival the chilly rain outside. Dress warmly, as the temperatures will drop further to around fifty, and a good umbrella might just be your best companion.",
