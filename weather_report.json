    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean, untroubled sky; the last stars are fading and dawn is stretching in with a cool, quiet touch. The forecast stays cloudless into the morning, promising a bright, straightforward day of hard blue and sharp edges, the kind where visibility feels endless and the sun climbs quickly from gentle to insistent. UV will be low at first light but rise fast by midmorning, as Perth summers do, so it will feel pleasant early and increasingly fierce on bare skin. Dress for the arc of the day: a light layer for the nip before sunrise, then airy clothes, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen you actually remember. This is a morning for ordinary grace notes: stroll to the bakery while the streets are hushed, water the garden before it bakes, take a slow cycle to pick up milk, air the house while the air is still kind. Save any lingering errands for the shady side of the day and let the open sky carry the rest.",
