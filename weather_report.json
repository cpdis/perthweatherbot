    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a hard blue sky, the morning already bright and clean, shadows drawn with a draftsman\u2019s edge. The day ahead looks simple and unambiguous: clear from late morning through the afternoon, a burnished sun with little to interrupt it. Expect very high UV around midday, the kind that turns pavements pale and sends colors into high relief; clarity is excellent, the horizon crisp, the air feeling open and spare.\n\nDress for lightness and defense: breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and generous sunscreen; carry water if you\u2019re out and about. It\u2019s a pleasant day if you time it wisely\u2014walk to the shops now before the glare peaks, take a shaded table for a late coffee, or slip into a gallery or the library through the fierce middle hours. Later, as the sun softens, a quiet errand on foot or a small patch of gardening will feel just right, the evening promising that gentle fall of light that makes everything look newly arranged.",
