    "weather_report": "As the city stirs awake under a veil of haze, the early hours reveal an urban landscape softened by the gentle embrace of clouds. The temperature lingers around 50 degrees, a reminder that winter is steadfast in its grip. This hazy ambiance may hint at a tranquil day ahead, yet the cool breath of the north-northwest wind, only faintly stirring at 3 mph, will no doubt bring a crispness to the air as the sun gradually ascends. \n\nBy mid-morning, the haze is expected to lift, giving way to glimmers of sunshine that will flirt with the skyline, highlighting the city's architectural charm while temperatures peak around a modest 62. As the afternoon creeps in, a subtle decline to 57 promises a cooler, more comfortable atmosphere, perfect for leisurely strolls. While the marine layer may still cling to parts of the coastline, expect clearer views across downtown, inviting exploration through neighborhoods where vibrant caf\u00e9s and quiet parks await. Dress in layers\u2014a cozy jacket for the cool morning, giving way to lighter attire as the sun warms the day. Today is ideal for setting off with a good book to a local park, gently sipping coffee while watching the world unfurl around you, a perfect moment to relish the subtle beauty of a hazy San Francisco day.",
