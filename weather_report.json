    "weather_report": "Presently, Subiaco is waking up to a dance of light, with the dawn sky declaring the day clear. As the azure overhead holds not a single cloud, sunlight tumbles down, bathing the world in its golden splendor. It is as though Mother Nature herself gently lifts a lace curtain revealing her timeless and silent morning artistry.\n\nLooking into the day, the prognosis suggests uninterrupted sunshine. The UV index will maintain a moderate scale, offering people a pleasant opportunity to venture outside without the pervasive concern about scorching summer heat. One might find the perfect partner in a light cardigan, complementing a pair of comfortable shoes, ready to politely bow to the somewhat kind sun. A simple stroll through the local park, maybe a smidge of gardening, or perhaps a book read by the nearby lake - everyday pleasures seem to glow a bit brighter under such great conditions. All in all, Subiaco is set to host another day of pleasant sunlight, glimmering beneath the clear sky, a grand spectacle of everyday life orchestrated in the most beautiful of weathers.",
