    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a soft hush, the streets damp and reflective, a brush of light rain near first light tapering into a thick quilt of cloud. Sunshine will be scarce this morning; UV remains low at dawn and subdued under the overcast, with the day\u2019s edges blurred and the horizon a gentle smudge. It\u2019s a quiet, pewter-toned start that feels calm rather than cold, more contemplative than bleak.\n\nDress in light layers with a small waterproof shell and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles; an umbrella earns its keep. Take the early coffee and watch the pavement darken, let the bus or train carry you while the sky makes up its mind, then run modest errands between pauses in the drizzle. It\u2019s a good morning for inbox triage by a window, a tidy of the pantry, or a slow lap to the bakery if the ceiling lifts. Pleasant in a muted way, if you lean into its unhurried rhythm.",
