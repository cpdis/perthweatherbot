    "weather_report": "Bellevue drifts through late afternoon under an unbroken lid of cloud, the light soft and even, colors slightly hushed. The morning began overcast and the mood has carried on, with little, if any, sun breaking through. UV remains low; it\u2019s a day without glare, the kind that makes edges gentler and thoughts a touch slower. Visibility is steady, but the world appears matte rather than glossy.\n\nDress in quiet layers: a light sweater or soft-shell jacket, comfortable shoes, maybe a scarf if you run cool. Sunglasses can rest today. It\u2019s a good afternoon for modest errands, a lingering cup at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, or a calm circuit around the block to let the mind unwind. If you\u2019re staying in, put on a record, chop vegetables for a simple supper, straighten a shelf, or finally sort the week\u2019s photos. The weather invites unhurried moves and small satisfactions.",
