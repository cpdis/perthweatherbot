    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clean blue dome, the morning already bright and dry, shadows crisp as paper cutouts. Forecasts keep the sky clear through the heart of the day, the sun firm and unblinking, with UV rising quickly toward the sharp edge by midday. It will feel warm to hot and very exposed, though a gentle afternoon sea-breeze may take the glare down a notch without dimming the light. Air clarity is excellent, colours a touch saturated, the kind of day where even the pavement seems to hum.\n\nDress for lightness and shade: breathable fabrics, a wide-brim hat, strong sunglasses, and proper sunscreen with frequent top-ups. Carry water and let your plans lean toward the sheltered. Late morning suits a quiet coffee on a verandah, a browse through a cool shopfront, or a short errand loop beneath street trees; after lunch, a shaded park bench with a book or a slow lap at an indoor pool will feel civilized. If you\u2019re staying home, open the windows to the breeze, tend a few plants, and let the wash line drink the sun for you.",
