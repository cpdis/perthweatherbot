    "weather_report": "The morning in Subiaco has awakened to a gentle serenade of light rain, lending a soft and pensive mood to the early hours. As the clouds slowly drift away, there is a subtle promise of respite and perhaps a fleeting glance of sun as the day unfolds. The air is fresh and slightly cool, hinting at a persistent spring chill that suggests layering up with a comfortable sweater or a light raincoat. Nature's watering has bestowed a glistening sheen on the verdant greenery, creating a lush tapestry that softens the city's edges. It\u2019s a day built for quiet reflection, for a slow-paced stroll down a leafy street under the gentle embrace of an umbrella, or for sipping a warm drink in a cozy caf\u00e9 as the world outside wears its somber hues of grey. Reading by the window, with the rhythmic tap of rain as your background score, might just transform the simplest novel into a grand adventure. As for the UV index, it safely veils itself behind the gauzy curtain of clouds, making sunglasses more of a style choice than a necessity. Inhale deeply, and let the cascading drops of rain clear your mind as the day unveils its unique, soft-spoken charm.",
