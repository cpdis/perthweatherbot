    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a hush at this hour, the sky clear and deep, with a clean sunrise and a bright morning on the way. The light will be strong once it breaks the rooftops, the day likely sharp-edged and transparent, with little haze to soften the view. Expect the sun to feel honest and direct; UV will rise quickly through the morning, the kind that asks for a hat, sunglasses, and a steady hand with sunscreen. It\u2019s a gentle cool now, easy to breathe, tipping toward warm wherever the sun settles.\n\nDress in a light layer for the early chill with breathable short sleeves underneath; by midmorning you\u2019ll prefer shade over asphalt. It\u2019s a good window for unhurried chores and small pleasures: a stroll to the bakery before the rush, a circuit of the park while the grass still holds its cool, washing on the line so it dries without scorching, or a bike ride that turns homeward as the light grows fierce. Later on, errands tucked into shadows and a book on a veranda will match the day\u2019s clear, uncomplicated mood.",
