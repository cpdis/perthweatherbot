    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmospheric embrace of a moody winter afternoon settles in. The sky hangs heavy, a blanket of clouds casting a muted light over the city, hinting at the impending rain that will sweep in after four. With temperatures gently slipping towards the briskness of the mid-fifties, the chill is accompanied by a south wind that whispers promises of wetness, intensifying as night approaches.\n\nThe evening will draw in a steady curtain of rain, carrying with it the mixing scents of damp earth and sea. A low of fifty is expected, a mild rise towards a comfortable fifty-six overnight as the rains taper but not without leaving behind one to two inches of fresh moisture. The vibe is decidedly urban and atmospheric\u2014a perfect backdrop for sipping coffee in a cozy corner caf\u00e9 or indulging in a good book at home, perhaps with a warm blanket enveloping you like a hug. Dressing in layered comforts, from a reliable waterproof jacket to soft scarves, will suit the day\u2019s somber elegance. Head out only if you must, and if you do, a stroll under an umbrella can unveil the enchanting reflections of the city, softly illuminated by the rain-drenched glow of streetlights.",
