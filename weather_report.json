    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds hangs over the skyline, cloaking the city in muted gray tones. Rain is in the air, poised to make its entrance later tonight, likely after nine, as the south wind carries whispers of moisture, preparing for a light shower to paint the streets glistening and fresh. The evening unfolds with temperatures dipping comfortably to around fifty-three, a gentle reminder of the season's chill. Those wandering through the city might find themselves donning a light jacket, perhaps a scarf, to ward off the cool breeze swirling through the neighborhoods.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the day will likely remain cloud-covered, with sporadic chances of rain kissing the pavement. While a high near fifty-nine feels cool, the sinking afternoon temperatures invite a need for warmth without overburdening one's attire. The weather may not be overly inviting for outdoor adventures, but there's potential for cozy indoors pursuits, perhaps a visit to one of the city's many eclectic cafes or a leisurely browse through a favorite bookstore. All in all, the atmosphere beckons a sense of calm, offering a perfect setting for relaxing pursuits as the rhythms of the city continue to hum beneath the clouded sky.",
