    "weather_report": "Busselton wakes under a quilt of dull cloud, the early hours hushed and cool, with the sea and streets wearing the same soft grey. Through the morning the overcast looks set to linger, keeping the sun coy and the UV kindly subdued for a while; if the deck thins later, expect only a gentle brightening rather than a blaze. The day will feel matte and pearly, with flattened light and distant edges softened, good for unhurried eyes and measured steps.\n\nDress in light layers\u2014a long sleeve or a soft jumper over something breathable\u2014and comfortable shoes; bring a hat and sunglasses in case the sky loosens, and a touch of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out past midmorning. It\u2019s a morning for modest pleasures: a slow amble along the foreshore once the light settles, a take\u2011away coffee and a quiet page by a window, a small grocery top\u2011up, or tidying the week\u2019s corners at home. If you head out later, plan for a gentle grey rather than heat, and let the day move at its own even tempo.",
