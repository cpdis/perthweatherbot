    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of patchy fog cloaks the city, lending a whisper of mystery to its iconic skyline. The air is cool, rounded by a mild breeze that carries the faint scent of salt from the bay\u2014perfect for a quiet stroll through the streets enriched by the glow of scattered lights. Tonight's temperature hovers around 49 degrees, inviting a light jacket or a cozy sweater, while the gentle west-northwest wind adds just enough chill to remind one of the city's lingering maritime influence.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the presence of fog is expected to dissipate as morning gives way to a mostly sunny afternoon. A high near 58 will usher in the day, slowly retreating to around 55 by early evening as the sun begins its descent. As the fog lifts, the clarity of the day promises to reveal stunning views, perhaps sparking a sense of adventure in those who venture outdoors. With such a serene atmosphere, one might choose to visit one of the city's charming caf\u00e9s for a leisurely breakfast or take a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the tranquil waters reflect the newly brightened sky. It\u2019s the perfect antidote to start the week grounded in the beauty of the everyday, so dress for comfort and embrace the gentle allure of the new day unfolding.",
