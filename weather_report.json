The city\u2019s famous fog dances at the edges, teasing its way into the bay, setting an atmospheric stage that feels quintessentially San Francisco. \n\nAs twilight approaches, a veil of patchy fog will descend, wrapping the buildings in a soft embrace by morning. Tonight's low temperature will settle around the mid-forties, so as you contemplate your evening plans, consider something cozy\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront, where the cool air meets the lingering glow of city lights, or a quiet moment in a favorite caf\u00e9, where the warmth invites relaxation. Dress in layers to navigate the changing conditions seamlessly, allowing yourself the flexibility to adjust to the day's gentle chill and the night\u2019s creeping coolness. Embrace the unique charm of the day as it unfolds, each moment a reminder of the city's ever-shifting beauty, yet constant allure.",
