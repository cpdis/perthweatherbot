    "weather_report": "As the clock edges past two in the morning, Subiaco murmurs under a velvet blanket of twilight, cleansed by the earlier showers that have left the air fresh with the faint scent of petrichor. The rain, which tiptoed in softly and crescendoed to a modest downpour, has now given way to a silent embrace of the night. The sky, though clearing, remains mysterious, cloaked in the whispers of retreating clouds. \n\nCome morning, the day promises to unveil itself with languid sunshine filtering through vaporous remnants of the storm, like a theatre slowly illuminated. The UV index will likely begin low, rising just enough to remind one of its presence by the afternoon. It\u2019s a day best suited for strolling under the canopy of an old umbrella, the kind where raindrops tinker lightly as the sun begins to reclaim its realm. Dressing in layers seems wise, for the weather will flirt with both warmth and a reminiscent chill. \n\nAs the town stretches awake, one might find solace carrying a well-loved book to a quiet caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the moist, cleansed air. Or perhaps, wandering through familiar streets, observing how the world glistens anew after a rain, can offer a unique, meditative comfort. Today, Subiaco is a canvas of gentle contrasts, inviting reflection and embracing all who are willing to step outside and witness its ephemeral transformation.",
