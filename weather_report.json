    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a soft, lived\u2011in glow, the sky mostly veiled and the air carrying a hint of damp. Sunshine is done for the day and the UV index has slipped to practically nothing; clarity is muted rather than murky, the kind of cloud cover that lets the streetlights halo and, at times, breaks just enough to suggest a few shy stars. Expect a brush of light rain around the evening hours, easing back to broken clouds later on, a night more about puddle sheen and quiet pavements than drama.\n\nIt looks gently pleasant if you\u2019re dressed for it: a light jacket, something with a hood or an umbrella in hand, comfortable shoes that won\u2019t sulk at a wet curb. Good weather for small, useful rituals \u2014 post a letter on a short stroll before the showers, bring the washing in, sharpen a knife and chop tomorrow\u2019s vegetables, tidy the desk, put fresh water on the plants you keep inside. If you step out, keep it unhurried, a loop around the block to listen to the neighborhood breathing, then home before the next sprinkle finds you.",
