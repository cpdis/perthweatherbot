    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a dense curtain of clouds looms overhead, casting a muted pallor across the cityscape. The promise of rain lingers like a whisper, forecasted to arrive shortly after 4 PM. With temperatures hovering in the mid-fifties, a chill seeps in alongside the gentle south wind, which may be felt more as a nostalgic sigh than a true breeze. The air, pregnant with moisture, hints at the impending storm, and a 90% chance of precipitation looms\u2014an unwavering certainty of the world outside.\n\nTonight, the rain will gather intensity, ushering in temperatures that rise through the evening, reflecting the warmth of an approaching front. As winds whip from the southeast, gusting as high as 48 mph, the atmosphere transforms. In this scenario, fog may emerge along the bay, shrouding the iconic landmarks in a haunting mist that both obscures and enhances their mystique. Given this weather, layers are advisable; a sturdy raincoat and waterproof shoes will serve well against the impending downpour. Activities may best be suited to indoor pursuits: perhaps read that novel you've neglected, or indulge in a warm beverage from a nearby caf\u00e9. San Francisco's cozy establishments await, ready to offer refuge from the storm raging just outside, as the city revels in its ethereal, rain-soaked charm.",
