    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a lucid sky and clean light, the morning sun already finding its way into side streets and verandas. Forecasts point to a bright start, with only scattered, friendly clouds drifting in as the day leans past noon. Expect a day that feels open and clear rather than hazy; the kind where colors look honest and edges are sharp. With the sun asserting itself, the UV will climb through late morning toward midday, so it\u2019s wise to think in terms of shade, sunscreen, and unhurried pauses.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant day for small rituals: a mid-morning coffee run, a slow loop on foot to the shops, or a quiet bench to read while the light stays kind. Dress in easy layers that breathe, add a hat and sunglasses, and carry water if you\u2019ll linger outdoors. As the patchy clouds arrive later, the mood softens but stays agreeable\u2014good weather for finishing errands, tending a list, or simply letting the afternoon unfurl without urgency.",
