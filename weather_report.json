    "weather_report": "As the sun wrapped up its grand descent over Subiaco, the sky performed a seamless transition from soft, sweeping brushstrokes of cumulus to a deep velvet canvas, perfectly clear and inviting. It's now a peaceful evening, where the promise of a tranquil night lingers in the air. This afternoon, the few innocent clouds that decorated the heavens have tiptoed away, making way for a star-studded firmament. The air is cool and clear, and the residual warmth of the day whispers against the skin, assuring comfort without overbearing heat. There's a delightful crispness settled in now, perfect for a gentle stroll or a reflective pause beneath the emerging constellations.\n\nFor those wishing to dance with the evening in Subiaco, casual attire is the song of choice \u2013 perhaps a light sweater or jacket to fend off the delicate night chill. The softly fading warmth makes it a fine time for understated pursuits: reading a soulful novel on a quiet bench, strolling the neighborhood with your thoughts as companions, or simply sipping a cup of herbal tea on a porch. The clarity of the evening, unmarred by the direct rays of the sun, speaks less of sun cream and more of serenity, offering a moment to breathe in the entirety of the day's essence, wrapped up in the blanket of night.",
