    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco feels bright and clean, the sky mostly open with just a few amiable clouds cruising the blue. The light has that spring clarity that sharpens edges and lifts mood; expect sunshine to hold through the day with only brief veils of cloud. UV will climb quickly by late morning and stay assertive into the afternoon, so treat the sun with respect even if the air feels gentle. It looks like a generally pleasant day, mild at first and warming, likely eased later by a soft sea breeze that takes the harshness off the glare.\n\nDress for easy movement and sunlight: a light shirt, breathable layers, sunglasses, and a brimmed hat, with sunscreen as standard kit. This is the sort of morning made for simple errands on foot, a quiet coffee in the shade, or hanging a wash that will dry without fuss. A short ride to the shops, a book on a bench, or a lingering lunchtime walk through nearby parkland would suit the hour. Carry water if you plan to stretch your legs into the early afternoon, when the light is brightest and the UV most insistent.",
