    "weather_report": "Albany has spent the day under a seamless quilt of cloud, the sun reduced to a pale rumor behind the gray. Midday stayed dim and gentle on the eyes, with the UV index low and the light diffuse, more pearl than sparkle. Now, deep into the evening, that muted ceiling lingers, softening the edges of buildings and streetlights, and the air carries that familiar October hush that asks for unhurried footsteps.\n\nIt looks like a quietly pleasant but subdued stretch: no glare, no drama, just an even, overcast mood. A light sweater or a casual jacket will feel right, with something comfortable for a lingering walk or a bus ride home. If you have errands, this is a good hour to tuck into a grocery run or return a library book; otherwise, let the gray invite you to simple comforts\u2014brew a cup of tea, sort tomorrow\u2019s to\u2011dos, or take a short stroll to hear the leaves whisper along the curb. Expect little from the sun and nothing from the UV; today is for soft light and calm routines.",
