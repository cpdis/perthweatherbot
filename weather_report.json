    "weather_report": "Evening has settled softly over Rottnest Island, the sky mostly clear with only a few stray shreds of cloud sliding past and plenty of stars showing through. The air feels clean and a touch cool, the horizon sharp, the water dark and steady. UV is essentially nil now, and the night promises to stay tranquil and mostly clear, with only occasional cloudlets.\n\nBy morning, this pattern leans toward a bright start and a generous share of sunshine, so expect a clear, crisp look to the day and UV that rises quickly through late morning. Dress in easy layers tonight\u2014a light jumper or windbreaker if you linger by the shore\u2014and plan on sunscreen, sunglasses, and a brimmed hat once the sun is up. For now, it\u2019s a good night for an unhurried stroll to hear the swash of the bay, or to sit outside after dinner and watch the constellations gather; come early light, a quiet coffee on the veranda or a gentle spin to a nearby lookout will suit the calm mood.",
