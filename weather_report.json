    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night has settled softly, revealing a clear sky with the promise of sunshine beckoning for the day ahead. As the city winds down from the hum of activity, the temperatures gently dip toward the low 40s, creating a refreshing chill that cloaks the streets. The tranquility of the evening is met with a light north-northeast breeze, barely rustling the leaves and inviting one to embrace the simple joy of a warm blanket or a cozy sweater.\n\nWith the dawn of Tuesday, the forecast speaks of radiant sunshine pouring over the cityscape, its golden glow contrasting sharply against the cool breeze. Expect daytime highs to hover near the mid-50s\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the many charming cafes in the heart of the city. While the warmth of the sun will be a welcome embrace, the crispness in the air suggests layers will still serve you well; a light jacket or a scarf could be your allies against any lingering coolness especially in the early afternoon. Seek out the quieter nooks of the city where you might enjoy a book or simply watch as pedestrians bustle by, drawn into the day\u2019s unfolding stories under an azure sky unmarred by fog or fog horns, a rare delight in this coastal enclave.",
