    "weather_report": "Perth leans into the first day of spring under a polished, cloudless sky. By early afternoon the sun is frank and unwavering, shadows crisp, the air clear enough to see the day\u2019s edges; UV will be punchy for a few hours yet before easing toward late afternoon as the light turns honeyed. The forecast stays resolutely clear through the rest of the day, promising brightness without the bother of cloud or haze, the kind of weather that makes small tasks feel easy and time feel unhurried.\n\nDress for light: breathable layers, sunglasses, a hat, sunscreen, and a bottle of water for good measure. A shaded lunch outside, a quiet lap along the river path, hanging the washing to drink in the dry air, or a brief museum stop while the sun is at its fiercest, then a gentle errand or stroll as the heat slips from the pavement would suit the mood beautifully.",
