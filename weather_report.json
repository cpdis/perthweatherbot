    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, the sky is a patchwork of broken cloud, the kind that mutes the stars and softens the first hint of light on verandas and jacaranda leaves. It feels calm and temperate now, with no obvious threat of rain, and the day looks set to unfold under a shifting veil of cloud with spells of bright sun breaking through. Expect a day short on crystal-blue clarity but generous with diffused light; the sun will not be constant, yet when it appears the early-summer UV will rise quickly and bite, even through gaps and thin cloud.\n\nDress for a gentle start and a warmer late morning: light layers you can shed, breathable fabrics, sunglasses at the ready, and a hat and sunscreen for any time outdoors after breakfast. It\u2019s a pleasant morning for a quiet walk to the bakery, a coffee on the porch, or watering the garden before the light strengthens. Later, errands by foot or bike fit the mood; keep to the shade when you can and let the soft, intermittent sun do the rest.",
