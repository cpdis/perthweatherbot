    "weather_report": "Midday in Waco arrives under a polished winter blue, unmarred by cloud, the kind of clear that sharpens edges and quiets the mind. The early hours were cloudless and the day is holding steady, bright and uncomplicated. Expect sunshine to rule the afternoon, the sun lower but still lively; UV sits in the moderate range around now, softening later, so sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen are sensible companions. The air feels clean and dry, visibility long, colors honest.\n\nIt\u2019s a gentle day to move at an easy pace\u2014cool in the shade, pleasantly warm where the light pools. Dress in light layers, a long sleeve or thin sweater you can slip off, and a hat if you plan to linger outside. Good moments today are the ordinary ones: a short walk to run an errand, a quiet coffee by a bright window, a tidy-up on the porch, or a slow amble along the river paths before the light tilts and the evening gathers.",
