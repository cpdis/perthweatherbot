    "weather_report": "As the sun lingers gracefully in the early afternoon sky over Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a mostly sunny warmth, tantalizingly close to the brisk chill that looms just beneath. With temperatures hovering around 54 degrees, the air carries a hint of coolness, softened by a gentle west wind whispering through the streets. The visibility is notably clear, betraying a stunning view towards the Golden Gate, where the iconic structure stands proudly, mostly free from the fog that often enshrouds it. The azure sky, punctuated by soft, wispy clouds, promises a mild transition into the evening when clouds will thicken, bringing about a night that will settle around 46 degrees.\n\nIn such a delightful setting, the day invites a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps along the Embarcadero where the sun\u2019s glint dances on the water. Dress in layers to navigate the gradual descent into cooler, cloudier hours\u2014ideal for a light jacket or sweater complemented by a scarf. Whether you find yourself at a cozy caf\u00e9 enjoying the rich aroma of a freshly brewed cup, or visiting local art galleries, the city offers an understated charm today. As dusk approaches with its grey veil, save a moment to watch the sunset paint the sky in pastel hues, a perfect prelude to welcoming the New Year with tranquil grace.",
