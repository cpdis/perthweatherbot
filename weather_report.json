    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the air feels damp and unhurried, the sky a soft, pewter lid. Light rain is settling in around daybreak and looks likely to linger into the morning, so sunshine will be scarce early and the UV low for now; if the cloud thins later, expect only brief glints of brightness and a quick lift in UV toward late morning. The day\u2019s clarity will be muted, with softened edges on rooftops and a gentle gloss on the roads rather than any hard blue distances.\n\nIt reads as a quietly pleasant, if subdued, start: good weather for a light rain jacket, breathable layers, and shoes you don\u2019t mind getting wet, with an umbrella as a civil companion. Let plans be flexible\u2014run a few early errands under the shop awnings, take the bus instead of the bike, or nurse a coffee by a window while the showers pad by. If you head out later and the clouds crack, a dab of sunscreen won\u2019t go astray. Streets will be slick, moods contemplative, and the day may reward those who move at the speed of the rain.",
