    "weather_report": "Subiaco is easing toward evening under a patchwork sky, the sun slipping through breaks in the cloud like light across a polished table. Warmth lingers but no longer presses; the UV sting is fading fast and will be gentle by dusk. Expect the broken cloud to loiter into the evening, offering alternating moments of glow and shade, a calm clarity to the streets, and a soft, silvery cast as the day folds up.\n\nLight layers suit the mood: a breathable shirt now, with a cardigan or light jacket for after sunset. It\u2019s a good time for small, easy things\u2014a stroll to fetch something simple for dinner, a quiet lap around the block, a pause on the verandah with a book or a call you\u2019ve been meaning to make. If you\u2019ve been at a desk, step outside for a few minutes; the air feels forgiving and the light is kind.",
