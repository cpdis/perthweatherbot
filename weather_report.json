    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city is wrapped in an enveloping shroud of clouds, hinting at the promise of a moody, atmospheric Sunday. The current chill in the air, with temperatures dipping into the mid-forties, invites a sense of coziness as one may favor a soft scarf or light jacket for warmth. The breeze, gentle but persistent from the southeast, carries the salt of the ocean along with it, a prelude to the wetness promised later in the day.\n\nThe forecast whispers tales of impending rain, with the chance of intermittent showers peeking after ten in the morning. A soft light may break through the clouds, intermingling with the spectral fog that frequently tiptoes over the Golden Gate, while the day hovers around a cool fifty-nine degrees. In the afternoon, however, expect a subtle retreat in temperature as the sun wrestles with the marine layer, and the wind may stir up, creating a brisk canvas for all who venture outside. This is a day for quiet strolls through the misty avenues or perhaps enjoying a warm drink at a caf\u00e9, gazing out at the ethereal transformation of the waterfront. Embrace the weather's gentle melancholy with layers that will shield you from the chill while still allowing for comfort as you discover pockets of sunlight amidst the clouds and shadows.",
