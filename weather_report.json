    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a veil of tranquility, with the scent of moist air hinting at the rain that will soon grace the streets. Tonight promises a symphony of clouds, darkened by the approach of precipitation after the witching hour. The temperatures dip to a mild 47, with the gentle southwest wind whispering through the empty avenues. A tantalizing 60% chance of rain lingers, suggesting that umbrellas may soon be the city\u2019s best accessory.\n\nTomorrow, the clouds will remain steadfast, bearing more rain before noon, while the mercury hovers near the low fifties, marking an evening where the city is slowly bathed in intermittent showers. A casual ensemble of layers will serve you well; perhaps a lightweight waterproof jacket over a soft sweater, accompanied by those comfortable shoes that carry you steadily through puddles. Given the weather's propensity for comfort over excitement, consider a leisurely walk in one of the local parks, savoring the smell of fresh earth while the rain dances on city roofs, or retreating into the warmth of a coffee shop, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee cradles you like a soft hug on a crisp day.",
