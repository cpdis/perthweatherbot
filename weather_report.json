    "weather_report": "The night envelopes Downtown San Francisco in a cloak of muted colors and whispered promises of rain, the air heavy with the scent of impending moisture. As the clock strikes the early hours, the city stirs amidst a delicate dance of clouds, offering only the faintest hint of drizzle before the dawn breaks. With temperatures around a cool 54 degrees, the gentle south wind rustles through the streets, coaxing a chill that seeps through layers like the dawn fog that often finds its way into the bay.\n\nBy daybreak, expect the skies to shift \u2013 rain showers are anticipated to grace the morning hours, transforming into periods of brightness by early afternoon. Highs will linger near the upper fifties, a modest warmth broken by the gusts that promise to sweep across the city, reaching up to 30 mph. For those stepping out, a raincoat or water-resistant jacket will serve well against the elements, perhaps complemented by a cozy scarf to combat the lingering coolness. It\u2019s a day made for quiet walks under awnings, inviting visitors to explore the local cafes set against the backdrop of fog-kissed vistas, or to cozy up in a bookstore sipping warm beverages, relishing the warmth and escape as the city dresses itself anew.",
