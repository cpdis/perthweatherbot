    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Subiaco with a damp hush, the kind that turns pavements glossy and curls the edges of streetlight halos. Light rain is on the cards late this evening and again after midnight, so sunshine won\u2019t make an appearance and the UV index is effectively asleep. Clouds look set to keep their grip, softening the clarity of the night and making everything feel closer, quieter, a touch reflective.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant-enough evening if you dress for it: a light waterproof or hooded layer, closed shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and an umbrella small enough to tuck away between squalls. Consider errands that pair well with drizzle and calm: a slow walk under awnings to fetch something for tomorrow\u2019s breakfast, filing a few nagging papers, or giving the houseplants a once-over while the air is cool and forgiving. If you\u2019re staying in, lay out tomorrow\u2019s kit and let the rain do the talking; if you\u2019re heading out, aim for somewhere nearby and unhurried. Come the small hours, expect the patter to linger.",
