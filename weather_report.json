    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Katy with a clean, starlit calm; the forecast keeps the sky clear through late night, which means no glare, no haze, and a UV index that slips to nothing until dawn. It\u2019s the kind of gentle night that feels pleasantly open and unhurried, a touch cool on the skin, asking only for a light jacket or soft sweater. Take advantage of the clarity: a slow walk with the dog, a quiet porch sit, a quick errand while the roads are dry, or a simple tidy-up at home with the windows cracked to let in the crisp air; expect the serenity to hold steady as midnight arrives.",
