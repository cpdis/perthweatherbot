    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city is clad in a cloak of rain and cloud, that deep, enveloping gray that speaks both of chill and intimacy. The temperature hovers around a mild 54 degrees, hinting at an overnight rise that will offer little respite to those out amidst the elements. South-southwest winds stir, offering a brisk reminder of nature's touch, and with gusts that will flirt with 31 miles per hour, it\u2019s wise to expect a formidable chill. Tonight, the investment of an umbrella seems prudent, as rain falls in steady rhythms, promising between three quarters to an inch of moisture.\n\nMoving into Friday, the morning will coax the clouds apart slightly as the chance of rain dwindles before 8 AM. The day will likely maintain a mostly cloudy demeanor while the air cools a notch, settling near 60 degrees but retreating to about 56 in the afternoon. With a touch of wind continuing from the west, it is not the ideal day for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront; rather, it might be best to explore the cozy charm of a caf\u00e9, a quiet moment spent savoring a warm drink beneath the soft glow of indoor lights. With layers recommended\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a waterproof jacket\u2014one can move comfortably through this evening's rain-soaked scene into the fresh promise of daybreak.",
