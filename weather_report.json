    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a clear blue sky, the sun casting a gentle warmth that lightly embraces the city. The high will soon settle around 59 degrees, with a slight drop to just below that as the day wanes. A soft northwesterly breeze dances through the streets, hinting at the crispness that a typical San Francisco evening brings. Although the air is relatively clear, a faint marine layer suggests lingering whispers of fog, particularly along the coastal stretches. This creates an enchanting visual tableau where the Golden Gate Bridge peeks through a delicate veil, reminding us of the city\u2019s romantic allure.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, temperatures will ease to around 47 degrees, inviting you to wrap up in a cozy, layered ensemble\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a jacket to fend off the cool evening air. It\u2019s an ideal time to wander the streets, maybe stopping by a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the sounds of the bay harmonize with the gentle lapping of waves. For the more adventurous, an evening hike on one of the nearby trails might reveal stunning views of the city twinkling under the stars, each moment a postcard of life in this remarkable coastal haven.",
