    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds beneath a softly muted sky, a canvas painted with hazy blues and greys indicating the presence of a marine layer lurking nearby. A gentle chill blankets the air, suggesting that while the sun may strive for prominence, its warmth is elusive. As the day progresses, expect the atmosphere to shift dramatically around four in the afternoon when rain is likely to sweep in, coaxing the temperature down from a mild high of 59 to a cooler 55. With a promise of showers tonight, the winds will pick up, adding a sense of urgency to the day as they blow from the southwest, rustling leaves and gathering clouds.\n\nAs you venture into the day, consider layering with a light sweater or a jacket to guard against the brisk air, while an umbrella would be a wise companion as the forecast hints at drenching rains that will settle in as evening approaches. Should you choose to explore, a leisurely stroll through a bustling caf\u00e9 district or an art-filled nook may provide both refuge and delight, allowing you to savor the city's charm before the storm descends. The day holds a calm beauty despite the impending gloom, inviting you to appreciate the serene but shifting landscape of your surroundings.",
