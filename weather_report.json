    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds hangs heavily above, promising rain as the day unfolds. The brisk winds from the southeast whisper of change, with temperatures hovering around a cool 52 degrees. There's a lingering dampness in the air, hinting at both the moisture yet to fall and the chance of fog rolling in along the shores, obscuring the city's iconic vistas, particularly towards the Golden Gate. The marine layer feels palpable, wrapping the city in its gray embrace, while raindrops may soon join the swirling currents of air, creating a rhythm that will echo through the streets.\n\nAs the morning progresses, expect the rain to intensify, drumming upon rooftops and inviting a contemplative mood for those who venture outside. Dressing in layers will be essential; a light waterproof jacket layered over a cozy sweater should do the trick, allowing for transitions between the cool winds and the inevitable chill that accompanies rainfall. For those seeking a gentle reprieve from the elements, perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 nestled on a quiet street corner, offering warmth and the inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee, would be a delightful way to spend the morning, listening to the patter of rain while contemplating the day ahead.",
