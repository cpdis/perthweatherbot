    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself clothed in a veil of clammy cloud cover, hinting at the day ahead. The air is cool, wrapping itself around you with a gentle grip, and though the sun may attempt to assert itself, it will be in a dance with rain as the hours unfold. Visibility, while not hopelessly obscured, remains tempered, with the horizon blurred by the moisture-laden atmosphere. A light breeze drifts through the streets, carrying whispers of impending showers.\n\nThis Friday promises an interesting interplay of weather; expect the clouds to deepen as the day marches toward evening. As the clock strikes five, the rains are set to arrive, transforming the serene autumn atmosphere into a cozy retreat indoors. Dressing in layers would be prudent; a light jacket should suffice against the chill, while waterproof shoes could save you a squelchy fate on your afternoon outings. Given this atmospheric spectacle, why not explore the local caf\u00e9s and enjoy a moment of quiet reflection with a warm drink in hand? Alternatively, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront might provide a spirited antidote to the impending drizzle, allowing you to soak in the gray hues of the Bay.",
