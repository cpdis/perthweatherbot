    "weather_report": "It's a serene morning in Subiaco, with the first hints of dawn bringing a soft glow to the skies, promising a day touched by a gentle spring. The forecast whispers of few clouds early, their wispy presence parting just enough to let glimpses of blue twine through the canopy above. As time drifts towards the afternoon, scattered clouds may capriciously mark their fleeting trails against this vivid expanse, giving life to a dynamic sky. Yet, the sun, in its quiet determination, promises to keep the city warm and ever inviting, its rays softly filtering through the tranquil breaks in the cloud cover. Such a scene, while not harshly lighting the pavement, is radiant enough to suggest donning a light jacket to fend off the briskness that might linger in the early hours.\n\nIn this charming setting, people might enjoy a leisurely stroll through one of Subiaco's tranquil parks or perhaps find a seat on a sun-dappled cafe terrace, perhaps with a favorite book or a notebook, savoring coffee as the world saunters by. The UV index is likely low under these shy clouds, letting residents and visitors alike cherish the artistry of the day without conscientious urgency. It's a day painted in soft strokes, not demanding attention but rather inviting you to notice its gentle nuances, an encouraging backdrop for casual conversations or the contemplation of life's simpler pleasures.",
