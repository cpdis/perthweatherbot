    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm settles over the city, bringing with it mostly clear skies and crisp air. The temperature is dipping to around 49, offering an embrace of coolness that invites a light jacket or sweater. The faintest whispers of a northwest wind drift through the streets, barely stirring the stillness, hinting at the serene night ahead. \n\nTomorrow promises a pleasant day, beginning with sunshine that brightens the morning and gradually warms the afternoon, though a chill may linger as temperatures hover near 61 before gently falling back to 58. The absence of fog is notable, with clarity prevailing, allowing views of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge to sparkle against the blue horizon. It is an exquisite opportunity to explore the city\u2019s hidden corners or enjoy a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, basking in the comforting sunlight while appreciating the beauty of the season. As day breaks and the sun rises higher, one might venture to a cozy caf\u00e9, sipping a warm beverage as the city awakens, or perhaps find a spot in a park to embrace the tranquility of a winter day.",
