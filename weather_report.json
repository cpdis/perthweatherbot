    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle rain continues its serenade, wrapping the city in a soothing curtain of moisture until the early morning hours. The low temperatures, fluctuating in the low fifties, give way to a momentary rise before dawn breaks, accompanied by a brisk west wind that whispers through the streets at speeds that can almost feel like a soft embrace. With a 90% chance of rain, the droplets arrive like old friends, freshening the air and saturating the earth, while the city remains largely clouded, the promise of a more cheerful tomorrow lying just beneath the surface.\n\nOnce the sun rises, expect a transformation as the clouds retreat, unveiling a sunny disposition by mid-morning. The high will flirt with sixty degrees, gradually cooling to a more temperate finish in the afternoon. The wind will continue to dance playfully, livening the atmosphere with gusts that might stir those strolling the Embarcadero or meandering through Golden Gate Park. While fog may linger along the coastal edges, the city will bask in a clarity perfect for savoring a quiet morning coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9 or enjoying an afternoon walk through the vibrant streets. Dress in layers, allowing for the warmth of the sun while being prepared for the cool breath of the wind, and let the day unfold with simple pleasures like exploring an art gallery or visiting a local bookstore, all while reveling in the refreshing touch of autumn in the bay.",
