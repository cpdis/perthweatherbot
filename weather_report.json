Clouds linger like a soft curtain; stars are mostly out of sight, and the world looks a little blurred at the edges under the streetlights. UV is essentially nil at this hour, and any breeze feels more like a whisper than a shove.\n\nAs the day stirs, expect a muted sky\u2014more clouds than sun, with brightness arriving in short, gentle intervals. The sun, when it peeks through, should be mild, keeping the UV on the low side and the day\u2019s clarity soft rather than crisp. It\u2019s a light-layer morning: a thin sweater or jacket and, if you\u2019re stepping out early, a small umbrella or hooded coat for any stray sprinkle. This is good weather for simple errands, a quiet coffee by a window, or a short walk between breaks in the clouds\u2014ordinary comforts that make steady, unremarkable days feel quietly worthwhile.",
