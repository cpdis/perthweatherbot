    "weather_report": "Before sunrise, Ocean Beach rests under a patchwork ceiling of broken cloud, the ocean a dark slate and the streetlights haloed. Expect a day of shifting light: sun slipping out in brief, silvery intervals rather than blazing down. UV is minimal now, stays gentle through the morning, and may rise to a moderate bite near midday if those seams in the cloud open, before easing again toward late afternoon. Visibility should feel serviceable, with the day rendered in softer tones more than sharp glare, a calm, low-drama mood rather than a spectacle.\n\nDress in forgiving layers\u2014long sleeves or a light sweater, a windbreaker for the onshore nip, and sunglasses for those sudden bright windows; a hat if you linger at noon. It\u2019s a quietly pleasant day built for ordinary rituals: a slow beach walk with a warm cup in hand, a mid-morning errand on foot, tinkering with a bike on the porch, reading where the light pools, or a short jog when the sun makes a cameo. If the sky opens for a spell, take a bench, watch the water turn from pewter to steel, and let the changing light do the talking.",
