    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle chill wraps the city, hinting at the moisture that lingers in the air. There's a palpable sense of transition as rain comes into play\u2014expect a few light showers before night fully embraces us, possibly delaying your evening stroll along the Embarcadero. With temperatures dipping to a cool 52 degrees, ensure you have a light jacket to fend off both the wind and the occasional drizzle. The skies remain mostly cloudy, cloaking our iconic landscapes in a soft, gray veil that speaks of the imminent rain.\n\nThursday beckons with a greater promise of rain, marked by a likelihood of showers intertwined with moments of fleeting sunshine. The day will see temperatures peaking at a cool 60 before gently falling into the afternoon. While the wind, though only modestly brisk, adds a touch of bite, it's an excellent excuse to seek solace indoors\u2014perhaps curling up with a good book at your favorite caf\u00e9, or exploring the myriad of small art galleries sprinkled throughout the neighborhoods. Those adventurous spirits might enjoy an early sunset, casting golden hues over the fog-cloaked hills, inviting a cozy evening in this ever-enigmatic city.",
