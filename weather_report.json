    "weather_report": "As tonight unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a thick layer of clouds blankets the sky, offering a gentle shroud that cradles the city. The current temperature hovers around a cool 49 degrees, accompanied by a whisper of a breeze from the south, stirring the air just enough to remind us of the crisp winter evening. The city\u2019s familiar outline, usually vibrant, takes on a muted silhouette, but there\u2019s a quiet beauty in the way the lights begin to twinkle against the twilight.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the sun is expected to peer through the cloud cover, illuminating the day with a noticeable brightness. While the high will reach about 58 degrees, it will gradually fall as the afternoon deepens. As the morning dawns, a north wind will gently guide the air, creating a refreshing feel that is almost invigorating. Although fog may linger near the coast, enveloping the Golden Gate and parts of the bay, the heart of the city will bask in glimpses of sunshine, promising a pleasant day for those eager to step outside.\n\nDressing in layers will be wise, as the cool evening temperatures of tonight will ease into a slightly warmer but still crisp day. A light jacket or sweater should suffice against the chill in the early hours, while a more relaxed outfit will allow for comfort as the sun asserts its presence. With the day's moderate weather beckoning, consider taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or enjoying a warming cup of coffee in one of the local caf\u00e9s, where the sounds of clinking cups and quiet conversations create a satisfying backdrop to the unfolding day.",
