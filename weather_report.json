    "weather_report": "As the night subtly gives way to dawn in Subiaco, the gentle patter of light rain lingers over the town, casting a calm haze that engulfs the early hours. The humidity in the air tugs at the remnants of slumber, whispering softly through the misty morn. With the forecast hinting at continued drizzle, the morning shows no promise of brilliant sunshine or soaring UV levels, but instead offers a tender embrace of diffused light, perfect for those seeking solace in solitude. The clouds hang low, shrouding the day in an ethereal glow that feels almost cleansing.\n\nThis Tuesday morning, arm yourself with a sturdy umbrella and a comfortable waterproof jacket, embracing the rain as your companion. Let the drumming drops overhead provide a meditative rhythm. Perhaps a quiet walk beneath the sheltering canopy of trees calls to you, or maybe a window-side perch with a steaming mug, indulging in a book that deserves your undivided attention. The world outside takes on a silvery hue, a backdrop for introspection or gentle activities. Allow this subdued atmosphere to dictate a pace unhurried, finding beauty in the subtle symphony of rain and the comforting calm of overcast skies as the hours tenderly unfold.",
