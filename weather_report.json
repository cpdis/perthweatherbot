    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Subiaco, there's a gentle orchestration of light rain that taps leisurely on rooftops and pavements, echoing a soothing lullaby to the slowly dimming daylight. The rain has been a consistent visitor today, softly making its presence known since mid-afternoon, draping the town in a fine mist that dulls the sharpness of shadows and mellows the landscape. With the sun bidding a hasty farewell, its feeble light suffused by the overcast heavens, today lacks the exuberant brightness often craved by sun-seekers. The UV index, nestled comfortably on the lower end of the spectrum, alleviates any urgency for protection against the sun\u2019s fervor, albeit leaving the atmosphere a touch more humid and embracing than usual.\n\nThe day is far from uninviting; rather, it sketches an intimate canvas redolent of introspection and quiet pursuits. The attire of choice for this softly melancholic eve would be layers; the kind that whisper comfort and warmth, perhaps with a raincoat at the ready, should the heavens decide to intensify their gentle weeping. In such a setting, one finds unassuming joy in simple endeavors: a serene walk through a beloved park, the sound of rain mingling with nature\u2019s chorus, or perhaps a cozy sojourn near a window, book in hand and a hot beverage cradled between slightly chilled fingertips. The rain, it seems, is not an intruder but a gentle companion, inviting reflection and a slower pace as the night approaches, wrapping its humid embrace around the town like a comfortable old cardigan.",
