    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm drapes the city. The air feels crisp and invigorating, with temperatures dipping towards 48 degrees. A northwesterly wind whispers through the streets, sometimes picking up with playful gusts that rattle the leaves and sway the branches of nearby trees. While the sky remains primarily clear, the marine layer lingers off the coast, casting a soft veil over the horizon, reminding us that the Pacific's influence is never far in this coastal haven.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the dawn promises a sunny day, with a high hovering around 58 degrees\u2014warm enough to enjoy a lunchtime stroll or perhaps a visit to one of the city\u2019s many parks. Morning fog may paint some areas with a whimsical gray, but soon the sun will sweep through, illuminating the iconic facades of the city and inviting you to bask in its light. Dress in layers to embrace the chill of the morning and the warmth of afternoon sunshine. Consider embarking on a simple adventure: perhaps exploring the trails of Golden Gate Park or savoring a quiet moment at your local caf\u00e9, where a warm drink can complement the leisurely pace of the day. San Francisco's charm goes beyond its landmarks; it\u2019s in these gentle experiences that the essence of the city unfolds around you.",
