    "weather_report": "In the sleepy early hours of Sunday, the air over Downtown San Francisco carries a gentle chill, wrapped in a soft blanket of mostly cloudy skies. The low hum of the north northeast wind at a modest seven miles per hour whispers through the streets, while temperatures oscillate between the low forties and a budding 51, hinting at the promise of a brighter day ahead. As dawn breaks, the clouds are expected to loosen their hold, yielding to a predominantly sunny afternoon that will see the temperature rise modestly to around 62 before slipping back to a cool 58. The marine layer lingers, yet it seems less obtrusive than in days past, providing only a faint reminder of its presence.\n\nFor those waking in this serene, crisp morning, dressing in layers is wise\u2014think a cozy sweater or light jacket, perfect for the indecisive nature of coastal weather. As the city shakes off its slumber, consider a morning stroll along one of the piers, where the cool breeze mingles with the scent of the bay, or perhaps a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit, indulging in a warming cup while watching the vibrant city pulse awake. The day holds promise for those who seek the beauty hidden within the transformative light that filters through the clouds, a poignant invitation to embrace the quiet charm of a San Francisco Sunday.",
