    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a heavy, gray canopy, where the rain patters softly, joined by the whisper of the wind. The temperature hovers around a mild 59 degrees, soon to drift lower into the murky embrace of the afternoon. Visibility is notably shrouded, creating a picturesque yet moody scene, where the outlines of familiar structures dissolve into the foliage of fog and drizzle. The marine layer conspires with the soft grayness, wrapping the coastal hills in a velveteen mist that obscures the grandeur of landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, making them mere echoes in the distance.\n\nClad in waterproof jackets and sturdy shoes, City dwellers may find it best to embrace the dreary weather by seeking comfort in cozy cafes, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the aroma of baked goods. A leisurely stroll along the waterfront can still reveal the charm of the city's shoreline, although the biting wind and occasional gusts remind one to stay alert. Perched by a window, the view transforms into an ever-dynamic work of art as raindrops dance upon the glass, offering a moment to reflect on the beauty found in even the grayest of days.",
