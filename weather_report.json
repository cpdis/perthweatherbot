    "weather_report": "After the night\u2019s showers and a heavier burst toward dawn, Scarborough wakes washed and grey, pavements shining like slate and the sea a pewter plane. The sun will stay largely veiled behind a thick quilt of cloud; if it peeks through at all, it will be brief and pale. UV remains very low, the sort that hardly registers this close to the solstice. The air feels damp and cool, and the view softens at the edges, distant headlands drawn in charcoal rather than ink.\n\nExpect a showery, unsettled day with longer dry pauses as the morning wears on, though the mood stays overcast more than bright. Dress in warm layers under a waterproof, with shoes ready for slick stones and puddles; a hood beats an umbrella along the front. It\u2019s a good day for small pilgrimages: a slow coffee by a window, a lazy browse in a bookshop, a quiet hour at the museum, or a brisk walk on the promenade between showers, rewarded by something hot in a paper bag. If staying in, open a window to the salt air, catch up on letters, and let the weather drum its own gentle measure.",
