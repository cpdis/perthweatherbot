    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle afternoon unfolds beneath a tapestry of mostly sunny skies accentuated by occasional clouds, inviting residents to bask in the cool embrace of a high around 53. As evening approaches, the forecast reveals a shift: a drizzle is anticipated after 10 PM, hinting at a mildly contemplative night ahead. The clouds gather in preparation to shroud the city, while a soft breeze whispers through the streets, carrying the scent of humidity as temperatures recede to a low of 47, gradually rising through the night.\n\nThe visibility this afternoon remains relatively clear, yet one can sense the delicate veil of fog that often dances along the coastline, particularly around the Golden Gate Bridge. As the evening drapes itself over the city, the marine layer will likely deepen, blanketing the horizon in a cozy haze. For those contemplating an outing, a layered ensemble\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a water-resistant jacket\u2014will be prudent. An evening stroll to enjoy the soft murmur of the bay, or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink amidst the growing drizzle, could very well provide the perfect backdrop to the day's serene conclusion.",
