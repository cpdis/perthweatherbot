    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfurls with a tapestry of muted light, the city warmed by a shy sun lingering behind soft clouds. The charm of the day lies in its gentle contradictions, as temperatures strive to reach that comfortable 57 degrees, only to retreat slightly into a cooler embrace by afternoon. A light northwest breeze stirs the crisp air, offering a refreshing touch, yet the ambiance remains tinged with that characteristic San Francisco chill.\n\nAs the daylight unfolds, the marine layer clings to the coastal edges, weaving a veil over the horizon, particularly towards the Golden Gate, where fog mingles playfully with the incoming afternoon light. The visibility feels sharp but carries an air of mystery\u2014a fog that subtly hints at a hidden landscape across the bay, while city details emerge with clarity. It\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the nearby parks or a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 where one can enjoy a warm drink, wrapping up in layers to navigate the coolness. Consider donning a light jacket or sweater, savouring the comfort of layers as the day transitions towards a balmy evening, when the temperature drops and the sky begins to fill with stars, whispering promises of a peaceful night ahead.",
