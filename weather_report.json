    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Subiaco, the sky is scrubbed clean and open, the kind of clear that makes the night feel taller. Air sits calmly on the skin, cool and uncomplicated; UV is essentially asleep for now, leaving the stars to do the shining. It\u2019s the sort of quiet that invites a soft lamp, a book half-finished, or a slow step outside to breathe the crisp dark.\n\nThrough the small hours the clarity holds, pointing to a sunrise without fuss and a day that should turn bright and unabashedly sunny. Expect the UV to wake fast after first light, climbing quickly enough to merit sunscreen, sunglasses, and a brim. Dress in light layers you can shed as the morning warms: a thin sweater now, short sleeves by midmorning. It looks like a pleasant spell for simple errands, a coffee run on foot before the sun sharpens, or a tidy lap around the park while the light is still kind.",
