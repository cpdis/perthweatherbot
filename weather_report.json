    "weather_report": "As the early hours of December 12 blanket Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a soft, persistent rain, weaving a delicate veil over its familiar landscapes. The air carries the cool breath of the ocean, with temperatures hovering around 50 degrees, a modest chill that invites cozy layers. A steady southwest wind whispers through the streets, suggesting a day characterized more by introspection than activity. The promise of an inch or more of rain hangs in the atmosphere, a gentle reminder of the city\u2019s moody character, which finds beauty in gray tones.\n\nThroughout the day, expect the clouds to linger, pregnant with moisture yet offering intermittent glimpses of the world below. Rain is likely, though it may lighten to a graceful drumming as afternoon settles in, keeping the Bay shrouded in a mystical marine layer. The Golden Gate Bridge may appear as a ghostly silhouette, hidden by the mist, while patches of fog dance in and out, giving the city an ethereal quality. For those venturing out, a good choice would be to don a water-resistant jacket and sturdy footwear, perfect companions for exploring the art-laden streets or savoring a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9. The sound of raindrops creates a rare symphony, inviting contemplation and perhaps a quiet chat with a friend over steaming cups. Such a day is best enjoyed at a slower pace, finding joy in the mundane while the world takes a breath beneath an artist's palette of fog and rain.",
