    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco greets us today with a clear and bright disposition, the kind of weather that encourages breath and reflection. As the sun bathes the city, temperatures hover comfortably, gradually dipping into the early afternoon. The northwest breeze whispers softly at three to seven miles per hour, adding a pleasant coolness to the air without intruding upon the warmth of the sun. \n\nThis afternoon promises to remain free from the veil of fog that often dances along the coastline, revealing an unobstructed view of the iconic skyline, each detail crisp and vivid. With a low expected tonight around 43 degrees, one might consider a light jacket or a cozy sweater for when the daylight fades. As the evening approaches, the city invites you to stroll along the waterfront, perhaps to find a quiet caf\u00e9 where the soundtrack of evening conversations blends with the gentle lapping of waves. Whether you're wandering the piers or stopping to admire the Golden Gate\u2019s silhouette against the backdrop of dusk, today offers the kind of weather that makes even the ordinary feel exceptional.",
