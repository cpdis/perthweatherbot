The temperature hovers around a cool 56 degrees, dropping gently to a crisp 54 as the day progresses. The characteristic southwest wind whispers through the streets, moving at a moderate pace, a soft reminder of the ocean's influence on the atmosphere. With the sun muted behind a thick blanket of clouds, the day carries a somewhat somber charm, ideal for reflective walks along the waterfront or quiet sips of coffee in cozy corner caf\u00e9s.\n\nTonight, the clouds will persist, ushering in a slight dip to around 48 degrees, inviting layers that indulge both comfort and warmth. A light west wind accompanies the evening, perfect for stargazers with a penchant for crisp, clear nights. For those venturing outside, a jacket will be your best companion\u2014a practical choice to shield against the chill as you explore local art galleries or join friends for intimate conversations in well-lit bars. While the fog may obscure distant views, it offers a unique backdrop for the city's intricate architecture and vibrant life, beckoning all to appreciate the subtleties of an afternoon drenched in soft gray tones.",
