    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes in a dim, blue hour, the air quiet and cool with high clouds lingering and a hint of rain on the way. Expect light, passing showers to brush through after dawn, softening the edges of the morning and keeping sunshine at a premium; if the sky opens briefly later, it will be fleeting and gentle. The day looks muted rather than harsh, with visibility a touch gauzy and the UV low early, rising only to modest levels if a few breaks appear.\n\nDress for a damp start: a light waterproof jacket over breathable layers, comfortable closed shoes, and an umbrella you won\u2019t mind carrying. It\u2019s a morning for unhurried rituals\u2014brew something warm, clear the kitchen counter, or take a short, hood-up walk between showers to watch the neighborhood wake. If you\u2019re heading out, time errands around the drizzles and sit by a cafe window; later, when the clouds thin, a brief loop to stretch the legs will feel especially clean and calm.",
