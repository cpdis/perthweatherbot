    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the early morning, Subiaco is enveloped by a serene shroud of broken clouds, creating a gentle tapestry across the sky as if to veil the awakening day. The air carries a slight chill, suggesting a light jacket would be wise for those wandering through this tranquil urban landscape. The absence of direct sunlight gives the day an understated clarity, casting everything in muted tones that perfectly complement the calm before the bustling day unfolds. In terms of UV, it remains relatively low, adding a layer of comfort to embark on leisurely pursuits without the urgent need for sunblock. As Subiaco comes to life, those heading out might choose to indulge in languorous walks through nearby parks, where the weather plays accomplice to whispered conversations or moments of silent introspection. The cloud-dappled morning offers an invitation to pause, relish a warm coffee by a windowsill, or lose oneself in a captivating book that mirrors the gentle ambiance outside. Leisurely brunches and intimate gatherings seem fitting activities, made all the more enchanting by the day's subdued setting. As the minutes roll softly by, one may feel as if time itself is caught in the lull, holding its breath for the vibrant day ahead.",
