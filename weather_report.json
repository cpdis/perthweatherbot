    "weather_report": "The late afternoon in Bend drifts toward evening under a speckled sky, a few clouds softening the light as the sun slips away. Any bite of sunshine is brief now, and the UV index has fallen to nearly nothing. Air feels clean and a touch dry, with decent clarity to the horizon; if you look up soon, you might find a few early stars before thicker patches of cloud wander in.\n\nTonight leans gently toward broken clouds, more textured than stormy, and the mood is calm rather than harsh. Expect a wintry chill once darkness settles; dress in warm layers with a proper coat, and add a hat or scarf if you\u2019re lingering outdoors. It\u2019s a good evening for a short, reflective walk around the block, picking up that last grocery item, or tending to simple comforts at home\u2014tidying a room, simmering something easy on the stove, putting pen to paper. With the sun down and the UV tame, the sky becomes a ceiling for unhurried errands and unhurried thoughts.",
