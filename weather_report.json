    "weather_report": "Nanarup eases into late afternoon under a sky of scattered cloud, sunlight slipping through in gentle sheets. The glare is softened now and the UV is easing toward low, though it likely ran stronger earlier; the day feels clean and open, with good clarity and no hint of anything severe, just a calm, salt-tinged brightness that comes and goes as the clouds drift.\n\nInto early evening the pattern holds: broken sunshine tapering to a pastel dusk and a quiet, partly cloudy night. Dress in light layers with something to pull on as the warmth fades; sunglasses for the next hour, a little sunscreen if you\u2019re sensitive, then a comfortable jumper will do. Good hours for modest plans\u2014an unhurried walk along the dunes, a small errand before the shops shut, tidying a corner of the garden, or a cup of tea on the porch while the light thins and the day closes its ledger.",
