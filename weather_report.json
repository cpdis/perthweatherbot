    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun graces the city with its presence, warming the air to a pleasant peak near 60 degrees before gracefully yielding to the cooler embrace of the afternoon. The sky opens wide, unmarred by clouds, allowing a crisp azure expanse to cradle the iconic architecture below. Gentle winds whisper through the streets, shifting from the south-southwest, stirring the atmosphere with a gentle energy. As evening approaches, the temperature will dip, inviting light layers, perhaps a cozy sweater or a light jacket, to ward off the chill that settles with the dusk.\n\nThough the forecast heralds a clear day, the familiar whispers of fog may still linger at the edges, hinting at a marine layer that dances just beyond the horizon, offering the promise of misty mornings in days to come. For now, the clarity invites exploration; one might find joy in a meandering stroll through the bustling streets or a moment of serenity at one of the waterfront parks, perfect for savoring a warm beverage while watching the world unwind. Tonight, as the cool embrace of the evening rolls in, the tranquility of the partially cloudy sky will serve as the perfect backdrop for quiet reflections or intimate gatherings under the stars.",
