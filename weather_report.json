    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Katy, the sky hangs low and pewter, the streets still damp from yesterday\u2019s light rain and a ceiling of stubborn cloud. Expect a mostly gray, quiet morning with the sun a shy rumor behind the overcast; UV will be low early and likely stay modest even at midday unless the blanket thins. The light will be soft and diffuse rather than sparkling, clarity muted rather than crisp, with the occasional brighter patch slipping through like a promise rather than a plan.\n\nDress in comfortable layers and shoes that don\u2019t mind wet edges; a light waterproof jacket is the right companion for a quick errand or a slow stroll once the sidewalks stop glistening. The mood suits small, unhurried tasks: brew something warm, tidy the corners the week neglected, leaf through a book with the windows cracked for a breath of cool air. If the cloud lifts a touch later, take a brief walk around the block or a nearby park and let the muted daylight set an easy pace\u2014pleasant in its hush, if not exactly sunny.",
