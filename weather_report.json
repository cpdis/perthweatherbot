    "weather_report": "In the heart of a whispered morning steeped in dusk-like silence, Subiaco sits beneath the gentle patter of light rain. The evening skies had barely settled their doubts before the gentle showers commenced, and now in the small hours, they continue their soft descent. With the promise of daybreak, the clouds still wrap the dawn in a grey embrace, tempering any rush to rise. A sense of dreamy tranquility prevails, raining evoking memories of cherished mornings spent ambling with a familiar harmony between drops and heartbeats.\n\nThis cloak of mist and moisture suggests that the sun will play a game of hide-and-seek today, its warm fingers occasionally touching the earth but mostly yielding to the clouds' gentle persistence. Those venturing out should don their raincoats, perhaps savoring waterproof shoes that embrace tiny puddles without pause. An oversized umbrella could dance alongside you like a trusted companion. For today is not a day of grand adventures but rather one of indulgent simplicity\u2014a stroll to the corner caf\u00e9 for a warming coffee, maybe losing oneself in the tender refuge of a good book, or wandering to the local market, allowing the whispers of the rain to accompany an afternoon of contemplation. The air, blessedly cool, invites gentle movements and introspective endeavors, a fresh canvas of tranquility sketched with droplets that bead, gather, and rivulet away.",
