The air carries the crystalline chill of approaching rain, while the streets glisten faintly with the glow of streetlights, reflecting the muted gray of the clouds gathering above. Tonight's forecast hints at a potential sprinkle before dawn, the chance of precipitation dancing around 60%. Residents can expect temperatures to hover around the chilly high 40s as the east-southeast breezes whisper through the alleys.\n\nOn Wednesday, the city awakens to a day that promises a mix of partly sunny moments, shadowed by the likelihood of rain later on. The high will reach the mid-50s, with temperatures gently descending as the hours pass. An undertone of anticipation lingers in the air, suggesting that an umbrella might soon become both a shield and a companion, as a 70% chance of rain lurks on the horizon. It\u2019s a time for cozy layers\u2014perhaps a light rain jacket paired with something warmer underneath, as the marine layer brews its familiar dance with the coastal winds. A stroll through the quieter streets may be just the antidote to the midweek humdrum, a chance to enjoy a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or perhaps take in a gallery displaying the city\u2019s artistic soul, as clouds blanket the horizon in shades of deep gray.",
