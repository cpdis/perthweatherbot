As night gives way to day, the forecast promises mostly sunny skies, a rare gift for this time of year. The expected high of 54\u00b0 will coax the chill from the air, tempered by a gentle breeze from the north-northwest. While the cold bite of winter lingers, it is clear that the low-lying fog has retreated for now, leaving the skyline unobstructed, a striking silhouette against the soft glow of dawn.\n\nFor those venturing out, comfort will be key. Layered outfits\u2014perhaps a warm jacket with a cozy sweater underneath\u2014will suit the fluctuating temperatures brilliantly. A stroll along the waterfront, savoring locally brewed coffee in hand, could be an enticing way to bask in the beauty of a clear day. History-filled stops at quiet bookstores or art shops nestled in the city\u2019s nooks would provide a perfect contrast to the fresh outside air. As the sun ascends, it will invite the city to come alive, blending the stillness of morning with the anticipation of a bustling day ahead.",
