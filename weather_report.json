    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft curtain of rain envelops the city, infusing the air with a fresh, earthy scent. The clouds hang low, shrouding the skyline and softening the distinct edges of rooftops and bridges, lending a sense of serenity but also a slight chill, pulling temperatures to a cozy 54 degrees. Tonight's gusty winds, sweeping in from the south-southwest, will propel a symphony of drizzles through the streets, with whispers of over an inch promised in the coming hours. The air carries that familiar tinge of salt and sea, while the low visibility hints at a fleeting marine layer that veils the more iconic views.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the chance of lingering rain fades as the skies attempt to part, inviting a glimpse of sunshine amidst the clouds. However, the temperatures will steadily decline, so dressing in layers will be paramount\u2014think a snug sweater draped under a light waterproof jacket, paired with comfortable shoes for a stroll through the quieter, rain-kissed avenues. Embrace the day with a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or perhaps a leisurely jaunt through the streets to admire the city\u2019s resilience against the elements. As night approaches, the warmth of your surroundings will become a welcome refuge from the briskness that only a San Francisco winter can offer.",
