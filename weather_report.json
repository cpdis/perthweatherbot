    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Katy, the town settles under a soft lid of cloud. Earlier, the day wore a gray felt\u2014overcast at midday, loosening to broken clouds by late afternoon\u2014so sunshine came filtered and shy, and the UV stayed subdued; now, under the night, it is essentially absent. The air feels calm and ordinary, visibility decent but not crystalline, the kind of sky that muffles edges and keeps the world hushed.\n\nToward morning, expect the mood to linger: patchy cloud with occasional openings, the sun more silvery than bold and the UV likely modest for the season. Dress in light, adjustable layers\u2014a soft sweater or a light jacket you can shrug off if the day brightens\u2014and comfortable shoes for errands or a gentle walk. Sunglasses may be a nice-to-have if the breaks widen, but not essential. It\u2019s a good window-watching day: make a slow breakfast, sort a drawer, write a note you\u2019ve been meaning to send, or take a late-morning stroll when the light feels kind and even. If the ceiling lifts, sit on the porch for a few unhurried minutes and let the muted daylight do its quiet work.",
