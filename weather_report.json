The air is crisp at a low of around 48 degrees, with gentle breezes whispering through the streets from the north-northeast, inviting a lightness to the morning. While fog has yet to fully surrender to the sun, hints of its presence linger, especially around the edges of the bay where the marine layer plays coy, casting a soft mystery over the landscape. \n\nAs the day unfolds, anticipation builds for a shift to mostly sunny skies, promising comfort with afternoon highs nearing 60. Yet, like the city's unpredictable spirit, expect a slight drop towards 57 as the sun makes its presence felt. Dressing in layers would be wise\u2014start with a cozy sweater or a light jacket, perhaps a scarf to ward off the early chill, ready to shed them as the warmth embraces the afternoon. This is a day where a stroll along the Embarcadero could be just the remedy, where the gentle lapping of the bay intertwines with the sounds of a waking city. Seek out a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink while savoring the views, all while indulging in the simple joy of being amidst the vibrant pulse of San Francisco.",
