    "weather_report": "Perth wakes under a pewter sky, the air smelling faintly of wet pavement before the rain even arrives. The sun will be a rumor today, filtered through a high, sullen blanket of cloud; UV stays on the modest side, though a brief noon break in the overcast could still nip bare skin. Expect the light to be soft and gray, edges blurred, the hills smudged like graphite. By late morning the rain gathers into a steady, heavier pour, then eases to a lighter, lingering patter through the early afternoon, the kind that glosses roads and quiets the birds.\n\nIt feels more damp than cold. Dress for puddles and patience: a light layer under a rain shell, waterproof shoes, and a small umbrella that doesn\u2019t fight the wind. This is a day for short errands between awnings, a long coffee by a window, a museum hour, or tending to houseplants while the gutters whisper. If the clouds thin for a moment later on, take a quick stroll to breathe in the eucalyptus and watch the city shine a little in the wet.",
