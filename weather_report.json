The fog is a capricious companion, retreating by mid-morning to reveal a partly sunny canvas, though a degree of coolness remains as temperatures gently descend to a comfortable, if brisk, embrace.\n\nAs day unfolds, those venturing out should consider layering to fend off the morning's chill, perhaps opting for light sweaters or jackets that can be shed as the sun interjects its warmth in the afternoon hours. A stroll through the tranquil streets, perhaps a stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 for a steaming cup, would be a delightful way to savor the day. Nature lovers might find solace in a visit to a nearby park, where the scenic views juxtaposed against the fog\u2019s retreat offers a serene escape. With the marine layer lingering in the background, the city invites quiet discoveries and understated adventures in this uniquely beautiful winter morning.",
