    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is clean and spare, a few clouds loosening the edge of the stars. The air feels settled; the night is clear enough to trace rooflines and jacaranda silhouettes. UV is essentially absent now, and the darkness is kind to skin and eyes.\n\nToward the small hours and into dawn, scattered cloud will drift in, promising a morning of softened light with sun peeking through rather than a hard glare. Sunshine should feel gentle at first, then more insistent after sunrise; UV will be negligible until then and will climb quickly as the morning gathers, so carry a hat and a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019ll linger outside later. Light layers suit the early cool: a tee with a thin jacket, something breathable once the sun asserts itself. It looks like pleasant, unhurried weather for small, ordinary rituals \u2014 rinsing the coffee pot, watering the herbs, a quiet walk to the bakery, or a short cycle to tick off an errand before the day crowds in.",
