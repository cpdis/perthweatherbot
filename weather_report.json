    "weather_report": "As the city awakens under a shroud of night, the air is crisp and still, hinting at the promise of a clear Thanksgiving daylight to come. The skies are expected to shift from their tranquil, star-specked canvas to a bright blue expanse, where the sun will peek through, donning its mellow glow. A gentle breeze from the northeast caresses the streets, bringing with it the sense of a fresh start. By mid-morning, the sun will warm the day to a comfortable embrace, settling near 58 degrees and gradually cooling as it makes way for evening.\n\nThe tranquility of the morning presents an ideal backdrop for a leisurely stroll through the parks or a quiet visit to one of the nearby artisanal caf\u00e9s, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee blends seamlessly with the cool morning air. Those planning their day should dress in layers; a light sweater or jacket will serve well against the early chill, while something lighter may be more appropriate as the warmth of the sun beckons. As clouds are absent, fog will not steal the limelight today, allowing sweeping views of the Golden Gate and the vibrant cityscape to unfold in brilliant clarity. Engage with the day\u2019s potential\u2014perhaps an afternoon walk along the Embarcadero or a visit to the art galleries in the Mission\u2014embracing the lingering peace that envelops this beautiful city on the cusp of a sunny holiday.",
