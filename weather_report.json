    "weather_report": "Morning in North Perth opens clean and bright, the sky rinsed to a gentle blue that promises to sharpen as the sun climbs. The air feels mild now, but the light already has a confident edge; by late morning into early afternoon expect unbroken sunshine, crisp visibility, and a UV bite that arrives faster than you think. It looks like one of those simple, lucid days where the horizon is honest and the shadows are neat.\n\nDress for ease and sun: light layers, breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen you actually reapply. Plan errands and a walk before the day peaks, then drift toward shade or a cool room for the midday hours. It\u2019s a good time to hang fresh laundry, wander to a corner caf\u00e9 with a book, or take a gentle lap around Hyde Park and sit under a generous tree. Garden jobs are best early, windows open to let the house breathe, and a quiet hour of sorting the week\u2019s odds and ends will feel oddly satisfying. All told, a pleasant, sapphire-clear spring day\u2014bright enough to lift the mood, bright enough to warrant respect.",
