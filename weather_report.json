    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city prepares for a night enveloped in the embrace of rain and rumbling thunder. The air holds a palpable heaviness, an anticipation for the downpour that is forecasted to occur before dawn, drenching the streets and imbuing the atmosphere with a fresh, earthy scent. The wind whistles through the avenues, gusting with an energy that stirs the imagination, warning of the storms yet to come. As the temperature settles around a cool 53 degrees, an umbrella and a sturdy jacket are essential for those bracing to venture outside during this tempestuous weather.\n\nTomorrow morning will greet the city with lingering showers, a reflection of the night\u2019s tumult, before settling into a cloud-dappled day with occasional breaks of sunlight. The cooler temperatures will persist, prompting a layering of attire to navigate through both warmth and chill. Despite the weather's intensity, one might appreciate the invigorating quality of the rain, perhaps enjoying a leisurely morning reading a book in a cozy caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm beverage while watching the world outside blur in droplets. For the adventurous, a stroll through one of the city\u2019s parks, with the atmospheric mist and verdant foliage glistening under the muted light, could offer a quiet reprieve amidst the urban hustle.",
