    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a tapestry of shifting clouds, a moderate play of sun and shadows painting the landscape in muted tones. As the bright chill of the day begins to yield to evening, temperatures will gradually descend from a high near 55 to a cooler embrace, hovering around 52. The gentle northeast breeze, barely whispering at 7 mph, stirs the air but does little to elevate the day's briskness, prompting a snug draw from light layers.\n\nAs night approaches, the forecast hints at rain beginning after ten, cloaking the city in a thick veil of clouds. Expect a notable drop in visibility as the anticipated precipitation rolls in, bringing a 90% chance of rain and suggesting that the marine layer will blanket the Golden Gate and enshroud the neighborhoods. The temperature will sink to around 47, making a warm jacket or a cozy sweater indispensable against the damp chill. Tonight is not a time for grand plans; rather, it invites a retreat indoors, perhaps to an inviting caf\u00e9 or a quiet corner of a beloved library, allowing for the gentle patter of rain to accompany your thoughts.",
