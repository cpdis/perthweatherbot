    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco opens on a clear, generous blue, the light crisp and easy on the eyes. The sun will stay dominant through late morning, with only a few friendly clouds wandering in after lunch; the air looks clean and well-defined, a day with simple lines and good visibility. UV will climb quickly as the sun rises and sit moderate to high around midday, so think sunscreen, a brimmed hat, and reliable sunglasses. Dress light with a spare layer at hand and shoes you don\u2019t mind walking in; it feels like a day that invites motion without hurry.\n\nIt\u2019s a fine window for a slow stroll to a cafe, a neat lap of errands done on foot, or a little tending to pots and paths before the afternoon brightness hardens. Later, park yourself in a slice of shade with a book, let the breeze do the talking, and make your way home unhurried as the sky softens.",
