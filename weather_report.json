    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, rinsed-blue sky, the sun already drawing sharp edges on verandas and gum leaves. The air feels clean and dry, visibility long and generous, and the light has that honest spring brightness that makes colors ring. UV will climb steadily through the late morning, so while the warmth is civil, the sun itself will be assertive by midday.\n\nThrough the afternoon the forecast stays simple: cloudless, bright, and good for getting small things done. Think light layers with breathable sleeves, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and a lick of sunscreen; carry water if you\u2019re out a while. It\u2019s a pleasant day for a slow walk to the shops, a coffee on a shaded terrace, or hanging the washing where it can dry in a cheerful breeze. If you\u2019re keen on fresh air, aim for mid-morning or later afternoon when the sun\u2019s angle softens; tuck into a book on a park bench under a tree when the light gets fierce.",
