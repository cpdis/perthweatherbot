    "weather_report": "Kings Park has spent the day under a polished, unbroken sky\u2014bright from morning through noon, the kind of sun that makes colors pop and throws crisp shadows. UV likely peaked around midday and is easing now to low or modest levels as the light turns honeyed and kind, with no real clouds to complicate the view. Expect the clarity to hold into dusk, the evening arriving clean and unhurried.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant finish: sunglasses still helpful for the low glare, a light layer sensible if you linger in the shade, and comfortable clothes for an unhurried walk. Mundane chores feel almost ceremonial in this light\u2014drop a letter at the box, water the garden, or take a small loop through the park and let the day glide to a quiet close.",
