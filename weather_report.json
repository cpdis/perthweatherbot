    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco is shrouded in a soft, damp embrace, with clouds hanging low, whispering promises of rain. The temperature hovers close to a modest 50 degrees, gradually warming as the night gives way to day, but a chill in the air hints at a lingering winter. With a 60% chance of precipitation, the scent of rain is almost palpable, making the world feel alive yet subdued. A gentle breeze from the southwest accompanies the clouds, nudging them closer to the city as they prepare to release their burden.\n\nAs Friday unfolds, the promise of rain before the afternoon is ever-present, with temperatures peaking near 57. The skies will eventually show glimpses of sunlight, casting a tentative, hopeful light over the urban landscape. The anticipated rainfall, likely measuring a quarter to half an inch, will refresh the city, invigorating the streets and cleansing the air. Though the day may start cloudy and grey, the later hours invite possibilities. Dress in layers to navigate the fluctuating temperatures, perhaps a comfortable waterproof jacket paired with sturdy shoes, perfect for the occasional puddle or unexpected spring. Whether it's sipping a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or indulging in a leisurely stroll through the quieter streets, it\u2019s a day to savor the simple joys of urban life, wrapped warmly against the coolness that the rain bestows.",
