    "weather_report": "Midday in Subiaco arrives with a soft, silvered light; the sun is warm but already slipping behind a gentle veil, scattered clouds gathering into a looser patchwork by mid to late afternoon. Expect a bright day rather than a blazing one, the horizon reasonably crisp and the air easy to breathe. UV will still bite through the early afternoon even with the drifting cloud, then mellow as the light softens toward evening.\n\nIt looks like a day made for unhurried errands and small pleasures. Light layers will do\u2014breathable shirt, sunglasses, a hat and a sweep of sunscreen\u2014so you can wander in comfort without feeling bundled or bare. Consider a lazy walk for a coffee and something simple to eat, a browse through a bookshop, or a quiet ride along side streets while the sun is still companionable. When the clouds thicken later, a gallery visit, a tidy-up of the balcony plants, or a slow read by an open window suits the mood. All told, pleasant and temperate, with a lingering glow that doesn\u2019t insist, it merely invites.",
