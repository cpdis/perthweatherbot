With highs coaxing the mercury near the low sixties and a very subtle north wind rustling through, it is a morning ripe for exploration beneath a mostly sunny veil. Yet, as afternoon tiptoes in, temperatures will dip slightly\u2014a reminder of the Pacific\u2019s lingering embrace.\n\nTonight, the tranquility shifts as a chance of rain looms on the horizon, arriving post-midnight with a whisper of possibility. For now, the charm of the day invites leisurely pursuits, whether it\u2019s a stroll along your favorite waterfront caf\u00e9 or a wander through the vibrant streets adorned by the iconic architecture of the city. Dress lightly but layer appropriately; a light jacket or sweater will by no means be excessive as the gentle breeze may cool the air. Although fog may return, for now, a golden day unfolds, waiting for you to seize its quiet pleasures.",
