As you step outside, consider a light jacket, perhaps a soft scarf, to ward off the nip in the air while you take in the nightlife of the city\u2014a leisurely walk through the Golden Gate Park might be a delightful choice, or perhaps a visit to a local bookstore, where the smell of old pages mingles with fresh coffee, inviting contemplation and warmth.",
