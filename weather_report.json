    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the air feels rinsed and quiet, the streets still dark and a little glassy with moisture. Light rain is likely to brush through around sunrise, a gentle, passing veil rather than a downpour. By mid-morning the sky should break into ragged pieces, offering intervals of muted sunshine. It won\u2019t be a searingly bright day, more a soft-focus morning with edges not quite sharp, though once the sun is up the UV will rise quickly for spring; even with cloud, sunglasses and a smear of sunscreen are sensible.\n\nExpect a cool, comfortable start that turns more pleasant as the showers ease. A light layer with a packable rain shell will suit the early hours; shoes that don\u2019t mind a damp footpath, then something breathable for later. Good conditions for small, ordinary missions: wander out for fresh bread after the sprinkle passes, post a letter, or take a mid-morning loop through Kings Park when the clouds thin and the light turns silvery. If you\u2019re staying in, crack a window and let the petrichor drift through while you sort a shelf or plan the day. The sun will peek in and out, enough to lift the mood without demanding you squint at it.",
