    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco finds itself embracing a blanket of partly cloudy skies, the air carrying a crispness that hints at a low around 47 degrees. The gentle west-northwest breeze, barely perceptible at 7 mph, stirs the scent of the ocean, whispering of the city's close relationship with nature. As the night deepens, the city's lights twinkle in quiet harmony with the heavens, but the fog hasn\u2019t made its presence felt, allowing a clear passage for stargazers to indulge in the night sky.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the sun promises a return, wrapping the city in warmth with a high near 56 degrees, before gradually retreating to a milder 53 in the afternoon. The expected peaceful sunshine invites those who seek solace or inspiration to venture outside\u2014perhaps for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where one can soak in the views of the bay and the silhouette of the Golden Gate. Dressing in layers is advisable; a light jacket should suffice to fend off any lingering chill, as the breeze dances softly through the streets. With the day\u2019s clarity and serene ambiance, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to explore local caf\u00e9s or hidden gardens, where the everyday magic of the city unfolds.",
