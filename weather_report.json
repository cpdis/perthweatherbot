    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under an open sky, drenched in sunlight. The crisp air invites a refreshing respite from the usual fog, providing a rare opportunity to gaze unimpeded toward the distant hills and the graceful arc of the Golden Gate Bridge. With temperatures settling gently around the low 60s, there's a comforting warmth that permeates the day\u2014ideal for a stroll through the city\u2019s vibrant streets or a visit to one of its quaint caf\u00e9s. As the sun descends, the clarity of the scene only deepens, casting long shadows while reminding us of nature\u2019s canvas.\n\nThis evening will offer a clear and tranquil sky, perfect for contemplating a peaceful sunset from one of the many viewpoints scattered throughout the city. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will suffice as temperatures dip toward the evening\u2019s tender low in the upper 40s. Consider a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the sound of the gentle waves meets the soft rustle of wind through the nearby trees, beckoning one to pause, reflect, and immerse in the soothing rhythm of the night. The absence of the marine layer today signals a delightful shift, allowing for those fleeting moments of serenity the city often promises but doesn't always deliver.",
