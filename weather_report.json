    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a soft, pewter sky, the light diluted and gentle, the air holding that quiet expectancy before the first drops. Late morning and early afternoon look set for on-and-off light rain, the day more silvery than sunny, with only brief, pale openings in the cloud. Clarity will be muted rather than murky\u2014edges softened, colors cooled. Even so, it\u2019s spring and the midday UV in Perth can still sneak through the overcast; don\u2019t let the gray fool you if you\u2019ll be outdoors for long.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for ease and small comforts: light layers with a breathable rain jacket, shoes that won\u2019t mind the damp, a compact umbrella that actually fits in your bag. Step out soon if you\u2019ve errands before the showers, then linger somewhere with a window\u2014coffee, a bakery, a quiet corner to read notes or draft a list for the week. A gentle walk between squalls can be oddly pleasant, the streets washed and reflective, but keep plans flexible and unhurried.",
