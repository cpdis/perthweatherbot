    "weather_report": "Albany wakes cool and damp before dawn, last evening\u2019s light rain still beading the sidewalks and softening the streetlights. Skies look stubborn and low, with only a shy chance of thinning later; sunshine, if it peeks through, will be fleeting, and the UV stays tame. Expect a muted, slate-gray day with occasional spit of drizzle and long spells of quiet, dry air\u2014more cozy than sparkling, but gentle on the nerves. A light rain jacket and easy layers will serve you well, with shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles and a fold-up umbrella for insurance. It\u2019s a good hour to brew something warm, sort the week\u2019s list, water the plants, or step out for a short errand between showers; later, a calm visit to the library or a brisk lap around the block suits the mood.",
