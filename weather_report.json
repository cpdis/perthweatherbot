    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the weather carries a serene coolness, with clouds softly cloaking the city under a gentle blanket. With temperatures hovering around the low 50s, the atmosphere feels subdued yet inviting. The North Northeast wind whispers at about 7 mph, a subtle reminder of the movement in the air. As dawn approaches, the promise of a mostly sunny Sunday unveils itself, with daytime highs expected to reach into the low 60s. The anticipated shift from night to day hints at an opportunity for the sun to push through the clouds, casting its warm embrace upon the urban landscape. \n\nWhile the marine layer may still linger at the edges, it does not threaten to overshadow the day. Instead, it sets a tranquil backdrop, perfect for quiet pursuits. A morning stroll along the Embarcadero would blend the fresh crisp of the air with the warmth of a rising sun. Those venturing out may find comfort in layers, a light jacket paired with cozy attire to navigate both the cool morning air and the sun's gentle ascent. Whether savoring a leisurely cup of coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9 or exploring the less-trodden paths of Golden Gate Park, today holds the promise of calm and clarity, ideal for those seeking tranquility amidst the urban vibrance.",
