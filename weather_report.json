The air remains crisp, with temperatures hovering around a comfortable 62 degrees, slowly drifting toward a cooler 58 as the day unfolds. A notable tranquility accompanies the north-northwest winds, whispering softly at a mere 2 to 7 mph, adding a sense of calm to the morning bustle.\n\nThough some marine layer lingers in the distance, veiling the Golden Gate Bridge in an ethereal shroud, the clarity of the day promises to grow with each passing hour. Tonight, the skies will clear further, inviting a low around 49 degrees\u2014a perfect opportunity for wrapping oneself in a light jacket as the evening settles in. With the weather so inviting, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to a local coffee shop, savoring the rich aromas while watching the city come alive. Embrace this vivid palette of near-winter warmth and moderate coolness, allowing it to inspire a day filled with simple, yet delightful moments.",
