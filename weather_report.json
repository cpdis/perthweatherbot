    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the weather presents a picture that oscillates between the expectation of sunshine and the lingering unpredictability of the season. Though a slight chance of rain was considered earlier, now the sun takes precedence, teasing through light clouds with zest. The high today settles around 59 degrees, while a fiendish west wind stirs the air at a brisk 14 mph, adding a layer of chill that whispers reminders of the ocean's proximity.\n\nTonight, the city's skyline will be draped in a cloak of clarity as mostly clear skies emerge, leading into a low of 46 degrees. With the northwest wind continuing its playful dance, it's best to don layers\u2014a warm jacket or sweater will serve well, especially as the sun dips below the horizon. Although the possibility of fog is present, it has yet to embrace the streets tightly, allowing glimpses of the Golden Gate and the structures of the city to stand proud against the distant marine layer. This afternoon's conditions invite a gentle stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a stop at a local caf\u00e9, where one can enjoy a warm drink while watching the world embrace the early evening calm.",
