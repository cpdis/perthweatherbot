    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a rinsed-blue morning, the light already crisp and generous, shadows neat and the air feeling clean on the skin. The sky looks utterly untroubled, promising a day of steady sunshine and sharp clarity; colors pop, edges are clear, and there\u2019s no hint of haze. As the sun climbs, the UV will bite hard even if the breeze toys with you, so think of shade the way you\u2019d think of a good friend: keep it close.\n\nComfort will be best through the late morning in the open air, turning bright and insistent by early afternoon. Dress light and breathable, a brimmed hat and dark glasses, a small bottle of water tucked away, and sunscreen wherever the sun might find you. It\u2019s a fine day for small, ordinary pleasures: a leisurely stroll to pick up bread and flowers, a coffee in a quiet courtyard, a chapter on a park bench under a kind tree, a basket of washing that will dry almost before you turn your back. If errands call, do them on foot while the light is gentle, then drift back to the shade and let the afternoon pass like a bright, uncomplicated song.",
