    "weather_report": "As the dark veil of night envelops Downtown San Francisco, whispers of rain ripple through the cool air, hinting at the coming deluge predicted with the dawn. The streets lay quiet under a blanket of clouds, their thickness heavy with moisture, harboring the promise of a rain-soaked morning. A breeze from the southeast stirs gently, brushing against the chill, a prelude to the atmospheric shift that will soon embrace the city. The temperature hovers just above the threshold of chilly, urging a layer of warmth. \n\nAs day breaks, the city will unfurl its damp, gray wings, revealing a landscape draped in mist and shadows. Expect rain to punctuate the rhythm of the afternoon, offering a somber yet soothing serenade to the ears. The world outside will glisten, with puddles catching fleeting glimpses of the fading light. For those venturing out, dressing in layers will serve as your best defense against the chill; a waterproof coat and sturdy shoes are wise companions for navigating the slick sidewalks. Perhaps take comfort in a quiet caf\u00e9, where the steam from your cup mingles with the aroma of fresh pastries, a simple indulgence against the moody backdrop of the sky above.",
