    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco on this Christmas Day, the sky emerges from its velvety night cloak to reveal a tapestry of soft, muted clouds. The morning air is crisp, with a gentle whisper of a breeze, heralding a pleasant start despite the forecast of rain later. Currently, the City is basking in mostly sunny skies, with temperatures hovering in the low fifties, a refreshing chill that suggests warmth can be found in a cozy sweater or a well-loved jacket.\n\nHowever, as the day progresses, the atmosphere will shift. Clouds will thicken and soon deliver much-needed rain, beginning later in the evening with a high degree of certainty\u2014bring an umbrella if you\u2019re venturing out. The wetness expected doesn\u2019t feel daunting but rather invigorating, like a cleansing of the soul to accompany the festive spirit of the day. While the iconic Golden Gate Bridge may play hide and seek beneath the marine layer, the midday sun will still find moments to peek through before the clouds embrace the vibrant streets below again. Expect to see families meandering through neighborhoods, perhaps warming up with coffee or exploring less-traveled paths around town, absorbing the quiet charm of a post-holiday morning wrapped in anticipation.\n\nEmbrace today by dressing in layers to navigate the shifting temperatures\u2014think light sweaters paired with a waterproof layer for the later hours. A stroll along the waterfront or through one of the city\u2019s many parks would be a charming way to enjoy the early sunshine and prepare for the soft evening rain that promises to refresh the Bay Area.",
