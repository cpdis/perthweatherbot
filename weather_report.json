    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Subiaco, the sky offers a display of unbroken clarity, like a sapphire polished to a high sheen. The day's final glow has long dipped beyond the horizon, yet the crisp, clear night holds a lingering luminance, teasing the idea of a day spent under pure blue skies and a sun unshielded by cloud cover. An idyllic repose is what we see: stillness, serenity, and a distinctly gentle temperature, perfect for wandering the quiet streets or lingering on a park bench, engrossed in a novel or watching the world drift by. \n\nToday has been unblemished, a day without shadows, save for those drawn by the robust sun. Despite the receding daylight, the crisp air remains, bringing with it an invigorating hint of spring. Dress comfortably, perhaps in a light sweater or jacket to ward off the whisper of chill that comes with the evening. Engage in simple pleasures like sipping a warm drink at a cozy caf\u00e9 or enjoying a leisurely stroll, taking in the tranquility of a town bathed in the reassuring glow of streetlights. Subiaco tonight feels like an artist's canvas, brushed with calming hues, defining the edges of a day that promises refreshment for both spirit and soul.",
