    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes to a bright, uncomplicated morning, the sky rinsed clean and blue, the light sharpening edges on verandahs and jacaranda limbs. It feels crisp now but already warming, the sort of clarity that makes colors ring true and shadows honest. Expect sunshine to hold steady through late morning into the afternoon, with the UV climbing quickly toward the high range by lunchtime; it\u2019s a day for sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and a swipe of sunscreen even if the air remains politely mild.\n\nDress in easy layers: a light shirt or tee with a cardigan you can shrug off, breathable trousers, comfortable shoes. The weather invites small pleasures\u2014carry your coffee to a sunny table, wander for bread and flowers, hang a fresh wash to dry, or take a mid-morning stroll through Kings Park to admire the spring stirrings before the light grows strong. By early afternoon the breeze may stir, but the mood stays clear and inviting, a simple, spirited day to be out and about.",
