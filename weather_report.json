The landscape is adorned in a misty veil, hinting at the lingering marine layer that softly blankets the Bay. Though partly cloudy, there are glimpses of clarity where the morning light begins to sift through the clouds, promising a day that teeters between delightful sunshine and impending rain. \n\nAs the day progresses, the sky will transition to a more whimsical mood, with a chance of rain slipping into the forecast by late afternoon. The warmth of midday will creep up to the low fifties, yet the chill from the northwest wind will remind you that winter still holds sway. This nuanced weather calls for layers\u2014a light sweater or a jacket, accompanied perhaps by a scarf to ward off the coolness. Morning adventures may lead you to stroll the waterfront or visit a cozy caf\u00e9, but consider keeping a brolly handy for that afternoon walk, as the clouds gather their resolve. A rare visit to a quiet bookstore might also be fitting, allowing you to indulge in a good read while the rain dances gently against the windows.",
