    "weather_report": "In the hushed hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco slumbers beneath a veil of crisp clarity. The night sky unfolds largely clear, a stark contrast to the typical embrace of fog that often blankets the Bay. Temperatures dip to around 43 degrees, nudged by a gentle north-northeast breeze whispering through the vacant streets. As morning unfurls its golden fingers, the sun will rise to deliver a bright and pleasant day, peaking near 61 degrees before tapering back softly to the cooler touch of late afternoon, where 57 degrees awaits like an old friend.\n\nThe prevailing tranquility suggests a respite from the robust marine layer that frequently dances along the coast. The views, unhindered, stretch out towards the Golden Gate, promising an invigorating day for leisurely pursuits. A light jacket layered over a long-sleeve shirt would suffice for those venturing outside, as the chill of the morning comes with a hint of sunlight\u2019s coming warmth. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero while sipping expertly brewed coffee, or a visit to one of the local markets, where fresh produce and artisanal crafts await the curious explorer. Today is crafted for quiet connections and simple joys, a canvas painted with the potential for delightful experiences beneath a generously smiling sun.",
