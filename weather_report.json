    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of patchy fog begins to weave its way through the city's undulating hills, hinting at the coolness that lingers in the air. The clouds hang softly, casting a muted glow over the streets, while the city lights sparkle like scattered jewels against the dimming sky. Tonight's temperature will dip to a crisp 47 degrees, a reminder that, despite the allure of the sparkling waterfront, one must be prepared for a chill, particularly as the north-northwest wind sweeps through at a gentle six miles per hour.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the morning will greet us with lingering fog, inviting a slow, tranquil start to the day. Yet as the sun rises higher, the clouds will give way to a mostly sunny canvas, allowing the city to bask in a comfortable high near 58, before tapering off to a cooler 56 by afternoon. Dress comfortably as you navigate the day; a light sweater layered over your favorite long-sleeve shirt would suffice, perhaps paired with jeans for a casual stroll. This serene Sunday offers the perfect backdrop for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where you can savor a warm beverage while watching the world wake up around you.",
