    "weather_report": "Perth eases into late morning under a washed-blue sky brushed with scattered cloud. Sunlight slips confidently through the gaps, lending the day a bright, open feel; the air looks clear and far-reaching, with only brief veils of shade as clouds wander by. UV will climb quickly from late morning into early afternoon, so treat the sunshine with respect even when it looks gentle. Expect the pattern to hold through the day: mostly sunny with occasional cottony cover, more companionable than dramatic.\n\nDress in light, breathable layers with a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a lick of sunscreen; you\u2019ll relish a patch of shade around midday. It\u2019s a day for ordinary pleasures: a small river walk before lunch, a caf\u00e9 window seat with a quiet book, errands done on foot, a tidy-up of the balcony plants, or a line of washing set to dry while the sky keeps watch.",
