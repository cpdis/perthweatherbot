    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a rinsed-blue sky, the sort that makes edges look sharper and shadows honest. The forecast keeps it simple: clear by late morning and staying clear through the early afternoon, a bright, untroubled day with hard sunlight and very little haze. Expect the UV to surge quickly and peak harshly around midday; the air itself may feel amiable, but the sun will not. Wear light, breathable layers, a broad hat, good sunglasses, and serious sunscreen; carry water and treat shade like a friend.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for modest errands on foot before lunch, for a quiet coffee under an awning, for letting the house breathe with windows open while the breeze\u2014if there is one\u2014finds its way through. Save longer strolls for later, when the light softens; until then, duck into a gallery, browse a bookshop, or tend to small domestic rituals. The afternoon should stay crystalline and bright, a clean page of blue sky that lingers into evening.",
