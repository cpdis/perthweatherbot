    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity begins to replace the remnants of patchy fog that graced the city earlier. The crisp air carries hints of coolness, with temperatures poised to settle near a mild 56, although they may dip slightly into the afternoon\u2019s embrace. The sky, a soft canvas of blue, invites sunlight to spill over the iconic silhouettes of the city, though some distant whispers of marine layer linger just beyond the horizon, suggestive of a coastal presence without encroaching on the day\u2019s vibrancy. \n\nAs night approaches, the city will don a partly cloudy cloak, enveloping the landscape in a tranquil embrace, with temperatures descending to around 44. Those venturing out might consider layering\u2014a light sweater complemented by a snug jacket for the evening chill. Today offers an ideal opportunity to stroll through local parks, indulge in an afternoon coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9, or enjoy a leisurely visit to one of the city\u2019s art galleries, savoring the quiet pleasures that a clear, cool day brings.",
