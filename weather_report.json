    "weather_report": "Bend settles into evening with a clean, open sky: a few clouds now, drifting toward a scattered veil by late night. Sunshine is fleeting at this hour and quickly gives way to twilight; the UV index is negligible, the light gentle and blue. The air feels crisp and honest, the kind that sharpens distant ridgelines and makes streetlights seem warmer. Expect a quiet, dry night with occasional clouds passing like idle thoughts.\n\nLayer up for a winter evening\u2014warm coat, hat, and gloves if you linger outdoors. It\u2019s a good time for a short amble around the block to watch the sky deepen, a quick grocery run before the chill really settles, or a cup of something hot by a window while you finish the day\u2019s loose ends. If the clouds thin, step outside for a few minutes of stargazing and the calm that comes with it.",
