    "weather_report": "Right now Houston sits under a softened noon sky, the morning\u2019s overcast easing into broken cloud that lets sunlight wander in brief, generous patches. The light is bright but diffused, colors a touch subdued, with clarity good enough for easy driving and long views down the boulevard. UV looks modest for winter midday, bumping to the low-to-moderate range when the sun finds a gap, so this is more a day of gentle radiance than glare.\n\nThrough the afternoon the clouds are likely to loiter and thin rather than vanish, a steady, temperate mood without much drama. Dress in light layers and breathable long sleeves; carry a compact jacket in case the breeze turns. Sunglasses help during those sunnier interludes, and a dab of sunscreen is sensible if you\u2019ll be out a while. This weather suits ordinary pleasures: a neighborhood walk between small tasks, a lingering stop at a cafe window, a quiet trip to the library hold shelf, or a tidy-up at home with the blinds open to the pale, collected light.",
