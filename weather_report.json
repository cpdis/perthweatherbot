    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts through midday with a bright, spring light and a few clouds knitting together, the sort that can wring out a brief, polite shower early this afternoon before loosening to blue by late day. Expect a largely clear evening after the sprinkle; the air should feel rinsed and sightlines crisp. When the sun breaks through it has a bite to it now, so the UV feels strong even between passing clouds.\n\nIt looks like a mostly pleasant day with a short interruption. Dress in breathable layers with a light rain shell folded in your bag; sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and a swipe of sunscreen will earn their keep. If the shower arrives, take cover under an awning for a late lunch or duck into a quiet shop, then step back out for a gentle neighborhood stroll once the light goes silvery and the clouds thin. It\u2019s a good afternoon for small errands, repotting a balcony plant, or a lazy circuit of the local park toward late afternoon when the sky steadies and the warmth softens.",
