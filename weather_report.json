    "weather_report": "Floreat settles under a clean, untroubled sky tonight; the last heat of the day has ebbed, leaving a quiet, transparent darkness. With the sun long gone, there\u2019s no UV to fret over and no glare to squint against, just crisp, dry air and starlight laid out like polished glass.\n\nThe forecast keeps it cloudless through midnight and into the small hours, so expect a pleasant, gentle cool-down. Short sleeves will suit a late wander to the letterbox or a circuit with the dog; bring a light layer if you plan to linger. It\u2019s a good night to water the pots, air the house, or sit on the veranda and let the mind unspool a little. If this clarity rolls into morning, the sun will be sharp and the UV quick to rise, but for now the evening feels kind, simple, and unhurried.",
