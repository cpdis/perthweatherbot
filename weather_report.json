    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a gentle, bright sky, the sun breaking through ragged tufts of cloud and pouring a clean mid-morning light across the streets. Expect the day to keep that pattern: mostly sunny with scattered clouds drifting by, the air feeling clear and dry, visibility sharp enough to make colors pop. UV will rise quickly as the sun climbs and stay assertive through early afternoon, even when a cloud slides across, so it will feel pleasant but a touch insistent on exposed skin. Dress in light layers with a brimmed hat and sunglasses; sunscreen is not optional. It\u2019s the sort of day made for small errands on foot, a coffee carried out to a shaded table, windows cracked for a fresh cross-breeze, or a quiet lap around the park before lunch. Later, consider a mid-afternoon pause in the shade with a book, letting the bright hours pass like slow water.",
