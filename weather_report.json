    "weather_report": "Perth leans into late afternoon with a clean, open sky and sunlight that\u2019s still bright but gentling at the edges, throwing longer, kinder shadows. Visibility is sharp, colors true, and the day feels honest and dry. UV glare is easing now, sliding from the punchy part of the day toward something more forgiving by early evening, though a hat and sunglasses still earn their keep if you\u2019re out before dusk.\n\nExpect the rest of the day to stay clear and calm, with only a few clouds wandering in after sunset. It reads as a pleasant finish: warm enough for comfort, cooling toward night. Dress light and breathable for the walk home; tuck a soft layer under your arm for later. This is good weather for small, ordinary victories\u2014an unhurried lap around the block, a detour to pick up fruit for tomorrow, a few pages on the balcony, a quick sweep of the step, windows opened to let the last golden hour drift through.",
