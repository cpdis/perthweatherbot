    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with the sky torn into moving panels of cloud, the streets still beaded from a light rain that passed in the late afternoon. The sun is all but gone now and any sting to the light has faded; UV is negligible, and the air feels rinsed and calm, with visibility softened but clear enough to see the hills in silhouette. Expect a mostly dry, mottled sky through the night, the kind that lets a few stars slip through between darker seams. It\u2019s a gentle, slightly damp sort of pleasantness: pull on light layers and comfortable, closed shoes, and keep a small umbrella or a hood handy more out of habit than need. Good hours for unhurried tasks and small errands\u2014fetch a loaf from the corner bakery before closing, take a slow walk to admire the slick cobbles, or linger at a quiet table with something simple to eat while the clouds shuffle overhead. If you\u2019re staying in, sort a drawer, water the plants, or draft a postcard; the weather encourages modest rituals and an early, contented night.",
