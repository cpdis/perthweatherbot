    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours weave through the quiet streets of Perth, a gentle patter of rain continues to dance on rooftops, a lingering serenade from the midnight sky. This morning begins with cloud-draped skies, with whispers of light rain that suggest an introspective mood rather than the sun\u2019s radiant embrace. The day, with its gray and damp complexion, carries a soft mystery, inviting you to reach for the comfort of a warm, well-worn sweater or a trusty raincoat as a shield against the periodic showers that persist. While the sun may remain a shy performer hidden behind the thick curtain of clouds, the day invites a stroll along paths that glisten with rain-kissed elegance, or perhaps the cozy refuge of a caf\u00e9, where a steaming cup of coffee and the rhythmic patter of rain can become quiet companions to your thoughts. The subdued light and freshened air enrich this bordering-on-melancholic April day, making it ideal for low-key indoor pursuits such as diving into a beloved book, or simply watching the rain paint abstract strokes on windows.",
