    "weather_report": "As twilight cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp yet inviting, the kind of evening where the lingering warmth of the day begins to soften into a cooler embrace. Tonight, the skies are clear, allowing the city\u2019s lights to twinkle like a myriad of stars captured in glass, standing against the backdrop of a deepening blue. The forecast suggests a low around 51 degrees, an almost gentle chill that simmers just above crispness. A soft breeze from the south whispers through the streets, promising a night filled with serenity.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun is set to return, generous in its warmth, with temperatures peaking near 65 before mellowing to around 61 in the afternoon. The morning may wake with a touch of fog, but the promise of a clear and sunny day looms as the marine layer recedes. For those navigating the streets, layers will serve best; a light jacket or sweater could be just the companion for the evening stroll, giving way to a more relaxed outfit for the sunlit hours ahead. As the day unfolds, consider a leisurely walk along the waterfront or an exploration of local cafes to savor a moment of connection with the vibrant heart of the city, enveloped in both its storied past and its present pulse.",
