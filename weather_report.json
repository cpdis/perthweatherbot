    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds cloaks the skyline, whispering a chill as temperatures descend to a crisp 46 degrees. The north-northeast wind, soft and unhurried at about 7 mph, adds a touch of bite to the evening air, encouraging a cozy embrace of layers for anyone venturing outside.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Wednesday, expect a shift. The morning promises moments of sunshine, yet as the afternoon draws near, a potential for rain emerges\u2014 a 50% chance, as nature teases with light, fleeting drizzles that may scarcely measure a tenth of an inch. The day will peak at a modest 59 degrees, gradually yielding to cooler conditions around 56 in the afternoon. The northwest wind will play a serene cadence through the day. Currently, it looks relatively clear, but don\u2019t be surprised if the marine layer rolls in, shrouding the city in its characteristic fog, particularly near the bridges. For attire, consider a warm jacket complemented by a lightweight umbrella, preparing for the sporadic sprinkles and ensuring comfort throughout the day. Given the atmospheric conditions, a leisurely stroll through the quieter streets, perhaps savoring a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9, would be a delightful way to embrace this shifting weather.",
