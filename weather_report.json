    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun strides across a brilliantly clear sky, casting warm illumination on the streets below. The air is crisp, invigorating\u2014swaying gently with a light northwestern breeze that rustles the leaves of palm trees lining the avenues. Temperatures hover around a pleasant 58 degrees, dipping slightly as the day gracefully moves toward evening. Visible from all corners is a dance of light and shadow, without a trace of fog or the usual marine layer that can cloak the city in misty coolness. \n\nAs daylight wanes, you might consider slipping into a light sweater or a jacket, with layers to accommodate the swift change in temperatures as night approaches, when the mercury dips down to a cooler 44 degrees. An ideal way to embrace this exquisite weather involves a serene stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for a moment at a cozy caf\u00e9, where the evening air holds an inviting chill, perfect for a warm drink. Take in the unhurried pace of the city as it begins to settle for the night, delighting in the vibrant rhythm that defines this iconic locale.",
