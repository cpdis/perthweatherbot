    "weather_report": "Pre-dawn in Subiaco is quiet and crystalline, the sky a deep, untroubled blue with the first hint of light gathering at the edge. It\u2019s cool enough to feel clean on the skin, and the clarity is striking; no cloud to smudge the horizon, just a sense that the day will arrive on time and without fuss.\n\nExpect a bright, sun-forward morning once the sun lifts, with a long spell of clear sky and sharp shadows. UV will climb quickly after sunrise and become strong by late morning, so think light layers for the early chill, then breathable fabrics, sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen if you linger outside. It looks like a pleasant day to ease into: a quiet walk as the birds tune up, an unhurried coffee on the verandah, hanging out the washing before breakfast, a gentle ride to work, or a quick errand through the neighborhood while the light is soft. By mid-morning, seek a patch of shade if you\u2019re lingering outdoors, and let the sun do the heavy lifting while you keep the pace humane.",
