    "weather_report": "As the chill of the night lingers, the early hours of Thursday greet Downtown San Francisco with a tranquil clarity. At this moment, the sky is unmarred by fog, presenting a calm canvas of deep navy, slowly yielding to the promise of dawn. The city will awaken under a bright sun, with temperatures rising gently towards the afternoon, casting a warm but restrained glow across the iconic skyline.\n\nThe day ahead holds delightful prospects as the sunshine bathes the streets, although a subtle shift in temperature will cool the air slightly by midday. Dress in layers to embrace the day's gradual transformation; perhaps a light sweater over a comfortable shirt would suffice, ensuring comfort as the breeze carries a hint of the ocean's influence. With the inviting weather calling on local residents and visitors alike, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the soft rhythm of the water meets the vibrant pulse of the city, or perhaps lose yourself in a quaint caf\u00e9, savoring the aromas of fresh coffee as you watch the world come to life.",
