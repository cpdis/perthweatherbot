    "weather_report": "Mid-morning in Subiaco arrives bright and uncomplicated, the sky a polished pane with no cloud to smudge it. The forecast holds steady through the late morning and early afternoon, promising unabashed sunshine and that crisp spring clarity that makes colors pop and shadows neat. Expect the UV to surge quickly as the sun climbs; a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen earn their keep, and a light long-sleeve wouldn\u2019t be out of place. Air feels dry and clean, the day leaning toward pleasantly warm rather than heavy, ideal for unhurried errands on foot, a quiet coffee in a shaded courtyard, or airing the house while you water balcony herbs. Dress in breathable layers and comfortable shoes, keep a bottle of water within reach, and let the simple rhythm of a clear day set the pace.",
