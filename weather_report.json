    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere presents a dance between sun and shadow as the afternoon unfolds. Fleeting glimpses of partly sunny skies dapple the city, yet a discernible chill lingers in the air, hinting at the rain showers that might soon reveal themselves. With temperatures hovering around a high of 54 degrees, the breeze animates the streets, a gentle north-northeast wind whispering through the alleyways, stirring the leaves and creating a soft murmur over the golden tones of the bay. The clouds, thick with the weight of potential rainfall, cast a muted veil over the iconic skyline, suggesting a 30 percent chance that the day will take on a more somber feel as evening approaches.\n\nAs twilight draws near, the city will rest beneath a partly cloudy canopy, with temperatures expected to settle around 44 degrees, rising slightly throughout the night. Those venturing out will find it prudent to dress in layers, perhaps donning a warm jacket to preserve warmth against the rise of the northeast winds, which bring with them gusts that can surprise a casual stroll. With rain likely, an umbrella might be a humble companion for an after-work wander or an early evening coffee run in the neighborhood. The mild encroach of fog along the waterfront will beckon you to the warmth of local caf\u00e9s or the cozy corners of a library, as the ambiance of the city shifts into a rhythm softened by impending rain. All and all, while the day may invite adventure, it suggests a graceful retreat into the comfort of indoor spaces as the shadows deepen and rain gently falls.",
