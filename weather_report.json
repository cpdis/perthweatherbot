    "weather_report": "The night blankets Downtown San Francisco in a cool embrace, veiled in a shroud of clouds that seem to muffle the city\u2019s usual hustle. A gentle drizzle taps at windows, mingling with the sounds of the quiet streets, as temperatures linger around 47 degrees. The south-southeast breeze whispers through the alleyways, an unfamiliar warmth hinted by its soft caress. The chance of rain is high, a promise of moisture dancing in the air, while patches of fog lazily drift, occasionally obscuring distant silhouettes.\n\nAs dawn approaches, expect the drizzle to transform into a steady rain, ushering in a heavily overcast day. The high will barely break 55 degrees, slipping back to the cooler embrace of the afternoon. Should you venture out, a water-resistant jacket and sturdy shoes will serve you well against the persistent droplets and gusty winds. The city may not offer the usual panoramic views today, but it invites you to seek enjoyment in the cozy warmth of a nearby caf\u00e9, where the rich aroma of roasted coffee dances with the sound of rain against glass. Lose yourself in pages of a good book or simply watch the world through a fogged-up window, finding solace in the simple pleasures that a rainy day can yield.",
