    "weather_report": "As the night blankets Downtown San Francisco, the low hum of the city intertwines with a gentle southward breeze, stirring a hint of anticipation in the cool air. Tonight, the skies are mostly cloaked in clouds, a soft gray that casts a serene, almost contemplative atmosphere across the iconic skyline. The temperature holds steady around 49 degrees, inviting denizens to wrap themselves in layers, perhaps opting for a sturdy jacket and a cozy scarf to ward off the chill.\n\nYet tomorrow's dawn promises a glimmer of brighter moments. While a whisper of drizzle might flirt with the early morning, the afternoon will illuminate the city with mostly sunny skies, bringing a gentle warmth reminiscent of late autumn. With highs reaching near 60, the day will gradually recede to a cooler 56. The south-southwest winds, playful but mild, will carry the crisp scent of the bay, reminding all who venture out of the calming embrace of nature and urban life intertwined. For those seeking a reprieve from the ordinary, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero might be in order, or perhaps a quiet visit to one of the many neighborhood cafes, where the warmth of coffee perfectly complements the refreshing air. As the sun shines bravely against the backdrop of scattered clouds, it beckons all to embrace the beauty of a San Francisco day transitioning from night.",
