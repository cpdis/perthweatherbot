    "weather_report": "Before sunrise in Subiaco, the streets glimmer under a fine, obliging rain, the sky pressed low and matte. Light showers linger into the early morning, easing in irregular patches toward mid-morning; the day leans gray with the chance of brief, silver breaks. Sun will be shy and filtered, keeping the UV gentle at first, though a stray bright interval could nudge it upward. The air feels clean and cool, and the view is more watercolor than photograph, edges softened by damp.\n\nDress for comfort and surprise: a light rain jacket over easy layers, shoes that don\u2019t flinch at puddles, and a small umbrella for the fickle pauses. It\u2019s pleasant enough for small errands, a slow coffee at a window seat, or a tidy-up at home with the breeze moving through. If the clouds lift for a spell, take a brief wander through the green verges and jacaranda-lined streets, then amble back before the next curtain of drizzle finds you.",
