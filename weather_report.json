A light jacket will suffice for leisurely strolls in the fresh air, where fog may begin to creep in from the Pacific later in the evening. It's the perfect opportunity to explore hidden cafes, indulging in rich brews while watching the world pass by, or perhaps to savor a moment in the park, where the hints of rain will nourish the earth for days to come. In this ethereal weather dance, there is beauty and calm\u2014a reminder that even amidst the impending clouds, there lies the promise of renewal waiting just beyond.",
