    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with clear skies that herald a day of splendid sunshine. The light breeze from the north carries a touch of crispness, yet the brightness envelops the city in a warm embrace, even as temperatures hover around the chilling 50s. The absence of fog allows the Golden Gate and the rolling hills beyond to emerge distinctly against the cerulean backdrop, enhancing the urban landscape with a clarity that is both invigorating and inspiring. As the day progresses, the sun will soften the chill slightly, allowing a comfortable warmth, though one might still feel the cool touch of the afternoon.\n\nWith the evening approaching, the skies will remain clear, inviting a chill to seep into the air as the temperatures dip into the 40s. Those venturing out might consider layering their attire; a light jacket over a sweater would balance the lingering coolness while remaining stylish for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the many cozy cafes in the area. The atmosphere is perfect for a leisurely walk through the streets, where the city\u2019s vibrancy remains palpable, or perhaps a quiet moment in Golden Gate Park, framed by the beauty of the setting sun.",
