    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the scene is rife with the promise of rain. A blanket of mostly cloudy skies hangs low, reflecting the juxtaposition of the city's vibrancy against its impending dampness. With temperatures hovering near the cool embrace of 50 degrees, a gentle south wind carries the scent of wet earth and an invitation to gather indoors. The forecast hints at rainfall beginning in the later hours, elevating the humidity and expectations for a cozy evening.\n\nTomorrow holds a similar tone, as rain persists throughout the day beneath a gray, overcast sky. Daytime temperatures may peak around 58, before gently dipping into a chillier afternoon. This weather calls for layers: a sturdy rain jacket, perhaps a light sweater underneath for warmth, along with sturdy shoes that can brave the wet pavement. Despite the drizzle, the city thrives with opportunities for quiet enjoyment. One could indulge in the local art scene, perhaps visiting a small gallery or caf\u00e9, where the ambiance is warm and inviting amid the cool mist outside. Alternatively, consider retreating to a corner bookstore or a well-loved corner pub, where the sounds of cozy conversation are punctuated by the steady patter of rain against the windows.",
