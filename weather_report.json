    "weather_report": "In the serene suburb of Subiaco, the day has gracefully slipped into the tranquil embrace of evening. As the clock counts moments past eight, we find ourselves reflecting on a day that bore gentle whispers of rain. The skies, a tapestry of muted grays, shared their light showers in the afternoon, ensuring the earth beneath is rich and fragrant now. Sunshine, elusive today, has left the canvas of the horizon for the moon to paint. Despite the intermittent drizzle, the air retains a comforting mildness, neither too warm nor too chilly. For those who prefer a gentle tread, a light jacket over casual attire would suit the evening\u2019s temperament perfectly.\n\nWhile the heavens have kept their sun-drenched joy at bay, the ambiance invites quiet contemplation or leisurely pursuits. Perhaps an evening walk is in order, under the soft lamp glow along Subiaco's quaint streets, where the earthy aroma of rain-kissed pavements mingles with the gentle rustle of leaves. For those fond of indoor havens, now is the time to cradle a book in your lap with a hot chamomile tea, allowing the symphony of raindrops outside to be life's gentle metronome. As waves of rain come and fade, Subiaco\u2019s night encourages a peaceful introspection, a chance to unwind, wrapped snugly in the arms of this wistful weather.",
