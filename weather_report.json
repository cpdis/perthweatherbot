    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a spotless blue, the kind of morning where shadows look freshly sharpened and the sun wastes no time staking its claim. By late morning into early afternoon the sky stays clear and bright, with that limestone-white glare that makes colors pop and eyes squint. Expect a strong, insistent sun; the UV will surge through the middle of the day, so the light will feel beautiful but unforgiving.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for light, breathable layers, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and a generous sweep of sunscreen. Take a late-morning wander for a coffee and sit beneath an awning, or run a few gentle errands on foot before the sun gets bossy; if you\u2019re thinking of a bike ride or hanging the washing, do it sooner rather than later, and save the early afternoon for a cool room, a book, or a shaded bench in the park. The day looks clean and buoyant, pleasant if you respect the brightness and keep to the shade when the sun climbs.",
