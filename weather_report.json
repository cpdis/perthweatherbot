    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco lies cloaked in darkness, the air carries the scent of impending rain, weaving through the streets and curling around familiar corners. The night whispers of a low of 51 degrees, hinting that the chill will linger, drawing us closer to warmth. As dawn approaches, the promise of a gray Friday emerges, with rain likely washing over the skyline, draping it in a soft, unrelenting shroud. The warmth from the day\u2019s high, expected to settle around 58, will be transient as afternoon winds carry a sharp chill, urging you to layer gracefully and don a sturdy jacket.\n\nVisibility may be compromised as the marine layer veils the Golden Gate Bridge and wraps around the iconic hills. The forecast suggests that the city will remain mostly cloudy, with a 70% chance of rain, foreshadowing little sun to illuminate the streets. A brisk breeze, gusting at times up to 31 mph, will remind those roaming the avenues of the winter air\u2019s bite. In such conditions, consider taking refuge in one of the cozy cafes that dot the corners of downtown, where a warm drink and the gentle hum of conversation can serve as a soothing counterpoint to the drumming rain, creating a perfect backdrop for contemplating the world both outside and within.",
