    "weather_report": "As evening gently wraps its arms around Fremantle, the sky, sprinkled with scattered clouds, offers a modest display of nature's subtle brushstrokes. The daylight, who so gracefully danced across the city, now quietly retreats, leaving a cloak of mildness in its wake. With the sun setting lower on the horizon, the air carries a whisper of coolness, a reminder of the shifting seasons. While the sun's rays become less assertive, the diminishing UV index provides a safe canopy for skin, if only for a few more moments of twilight. This time calls for a light jacket to ward off the impending night chill, while still allowing you to bask in the remnants of the day's warmth.\n\nAs the sky dims, the atmosphere becomes ideal for simple pleasures\u2014a leisurely walk through the streets lined with cozy lights or perhaps settling on a bench to watch the world whisper its gentle goodnights. This clarity of evening, neither too warm nor uncomfortably brisk, whispers an invitation to savor the pure, uncomplicated joys. The energy of the harbor may slow, but the heart of Fremantle beats with the steady charm of an old friend, urging you to breathe, walk, and dream.",
