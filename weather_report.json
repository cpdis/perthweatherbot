    "weather_report": "Beneath a vast blue canvas, Downtown San Francisco awakens to a day painted in sunlight and possibility. The high temperature approaches a refreshing 63 degrees, beckoning residents to step outdoors. With gentle winds from the north-northwest whispering through the streets at about six miles per hour, the air feels pleasantly crisp. As the sun climbs higher, an afternoon coolness will settle in, nudging temperatures to around 58 degrees, reminding all to layer wisely when venturing out.\n\nDespite the sunshine, a faint marine layer lingers on the horizon, hinting at the iconic fog that often embraces the city. This morning, it casts a delicate veil over the bay, particularly around the Golden Gate Bridge, where it mingles with the golden light, creating a magical dichotomy between clarity and mist. Tonight will unveil a mostly clear sky with lows dipping to 49, inviting cozy evenings under the stars. For today\u2019s escapades, a light jacket or sweater should suffice in the cooler hours, leaving room for the sun\u2019s warmth as the day unfolds. Consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet afternoon in one of the city\u2019s tranquil parks, where the beauty of this vibrant urban landscape can be enjoyed at a comfortable pace.",
