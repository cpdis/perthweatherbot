    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a cloak of mostly cloudy skies pervades the atmosphere, dimming the vibrant cityscape adorned with twinkling lights. The current temperature hovers comfortably around 45 degrees, invigorated by a gentle north-northeast breeze whispering through the streets. While the clouds add an air of mystery, they also signal a quiet, soft embrace of the night\u2014ideal for a relaxed evening stroll along the waterfront, where the chill might prompt you to wrap a scarf a bit tighter.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the sun will rise to unveil a mostly sunny day, promising high temperatures nudging toward 60 degrees before retreating to a cooler 55 in the afternoon. Although the morning may begin with a lingering marine layer shrouding certain vistas, especially towards the bay, it will gradually give way to clearer skies, allowing for delightful explorations across the city. Dressed in layers\u2014a cozy sweater topped with a lightweight jacket\u2014will be wise, ensuring comfort as the temperatures shift. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage or a leisurely walk through one of the myriad parks might be just what the season calls for, inviting moments of peace within the heart of the bustling city.",
