    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a canvas of brilliant blue skies, revealing the city in all its eclectic glory. The air is fresh, kissed by a gentle breeze from the west-northwest that dances through the streets, enhancing the feeling of clarity that pervades the day. With temperatures hovering near a comfortable 62 degrees, the sunlight spills generously over the buildings, casting crisp shadows while warding off any notion of fog's familiar embrace. The marine layer, often a companion to these coastal vistas, appears to have retreated for now, allowing the Golden Gate Bridge and the rolling hills in the distance to stand proud and unobscured.\n\nAs evening approaches, a low around 52 degrees will beckon for a light jacket, especially as the northwest winds pick up in strength, swirling at 15 to 22 mph. The colorful palette of the city will soon give way to the settling twilight, making it a delightful time for a stroll through the waterfront or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit, allowing the day\u2019s warmth to linger in memory. Whether chin-deep in a novel or immersed in the sounds of a local musician strumming softly in a nearby park, the night promises a peaceful backdrop for reflection.",
