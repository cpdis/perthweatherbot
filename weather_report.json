    "weather_report": "As twilight settles gently over Downtown San Francisco, the city prepares for the embrace of a cool evening. The forecast hints at rain, creeping in after the witching hour, while temperatures plunge into the chilly realm of the upper forties. The night feels damp with a 60% chance of precipitation, and a soft breeze from the southwest scarcely brushes against one\u2019s skin, inviting a cozy wrap of layers\u2014a light jacket, perhaps, snug enough to keep the sharpness of the cold at bay.\n\nSunday looms, promising a continuation of this moody tableau. The rain will likely grace us before the sun makes its first appearance, washing the streets in a light, gentle patter. With the high only reaching around 57, and the afternoon dragging the warmth a bit lower, it\u2019s prudent to dress not just for warmth but for comfort amid the dampness. Trendy boots will do well in puddles, as the weather turns from blustery to brisk, wrapping the city in a gauzy veil that softens the outlines of its iconic skyline. One might venture into a caf\u00e9, cozying up with a book, or enjoy a leisurely stroll beneath an umbrella, allowing the rhythm of the rain to accompany the quiet of the day\u2014as its softness transforms the ordinary into a moment of serene indulgence.",
