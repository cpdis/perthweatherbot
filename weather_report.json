    "weather_report": "As evening descends gently over Subiaco, the sky remains a captivating canvas of deepening blue, transitioning seamlessly from the earlier hours of bright, crisp clarity. The day was marked by an unabashed sun, its vigorous rays dancing across rooftops and winding through the trees, casting playful, dappled shadows upon the ground. Now, as the clock ticks past eight, the tranquil embrace of twilight envelops the town, finding solace in a cloudless expanse. It was, indeed, a day for the sun worshippers, the unwavering sun beckoning them outdoors to bask in its luminous warmth.\n\nWhile today's radiant sun was both invigorating and relentless, it advised a cautious harmony with nature\u2019s brilliance. The ubiquitous presence of sunscreen or a broad-brimmed hat was your best defense against the sun's ardor. Even as the fading light presides over the evening, there's a palpable sense of tranquility that soothes the spirit, urging one to linger outside a little longer. Perhaps a leisurely stroll through Subiaco's charming streets would be the ideal way to embrace the comfort of the evening air. The whispers of a gentle breeze speak of cool reprieves and invite a light jacket to accompany you on your amble, engaging with friends or simply delighting in the quiet solitude of the fading day.",
