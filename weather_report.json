    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds with a gentle yet persistent chill, as the remnants of nighttime fog linger like whispers across the skyline. Currently, the city basks beneath a veil of partial sunshine, though the air is decidedly brisk, hinting at what lies ahead. By afternoon, expect the warmth of the sun to fade, yielding to a cooler atmosphere as temperatures dip into the low fifties. The enchanting silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge could emerge from photogenic obscurity, though the omnipresent marine layer is lurking, casting a soft haze that blurs the edges of the vibrant cityscape.\n\nAs twilight approaches, clouds will gather, ushering in a steady rain that is anticipated to begin after 10 PM. The evening will arrive draped in clouds, accompanied by a notable shift in humidity, which will likely inspire cozy indoor pursuits. With a low near 47 degrees, a light jacket or a warm sweater will feel comforting against the cool breeze from the southeast. For those venturing outside, a stroll along the waterfront followed by a quiet visit to a caf\u00e9 or the local bookstore could provide solace from the night chill while embracing the tranquil beauty that only a San Francisco evening can offer.",
