    "weather_report": "As the twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the city envelops itself in a soft veil of moisture, a tangible reminder of the impending drizzle forecasted for the night. The streets, dimly lit and glimmering with echoes of bustling life, seem to breathe in the cool air. With a low hovering around 47 degrees, the chill whispers through the alleyways, inviting the wise to layer comfortably, perhaps opting for a light jacket and a cozy scarf. The clouds gather with intent, thickening into a canvas of gray, the promise of rain looming over the skyline.\n\nTomorrow paints a slightly more dreary picture, as the day unfolds under a blanket of rain, beginning with fleeting drizzles that will crescendo into sustained showers by late morning. The temperature will hover in the mid-50s, the wind picking up intensity, adding a bite to the already brisk atmosphere. The city\u2019s iconic fog may merge with the rain, delivering a cozy, atmospheric embrace, yet one must remain mindful of the watery streets. Activities calling for outdoor exploration might need to be reconsidered; instead, it could be a fine time to find solace within a comfortable caf\u00e9, a warm drink in hand, and perhaps a good book or engaging conversation to fill the hours as the rain dances against the window.",
