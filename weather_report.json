    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a soft hush, the air turning gently damp as a light shower drifts in later tonight and the sky loosens into scattered cloud toward the small hours. The sun has bowed out; there will be no blaze, only the low gleam of streetlights on dark leaves and a faint shimmer on pavements when the rain passes. UV is effectively asleep until after dawn. The night feels calm rather than bleak, a little smudged at the edges, with visibility softened by moisture and cloud.\n\nDress for an easy, practical night: a light jacket with a hood or a small umbrella, and shoes that won\u2019t mind a wet footpath. It\u2019s pleasant enough for a short amble between showers, or to linger on a veranda with the sound of drips for company. If you\u2019re out late, take your time on slick roads, and if you\u2019re staying in, it\u2019s a good night for quiet chores, a chapter or two, and an early turn-in while the weather tidies itself overhead.",
