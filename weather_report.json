    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Swanbourne, the sky is swept clean and starry, the air carrying that gentle seaside cool that invites a slower breath. The pre-dawn hours look to stay cloudless, promising a bright, uncomplicated sunrise and a crisp, clear morning; UV will be negligible now and then rise quickly after first light, likely strong by late morning in this season, so plan shade, sunscreen, and a brimmed hat if you\u2019ll be out. It reads as a pleasant day in the making: calm, clear, and unfussy. Dress in light layers for the early chill, then pare back as the sun takes over. Good hours ahead for ordinary pleasures\u2014airing the house, an early walk before breakfast, watering the garden while the birds are still talkative, or running a quick errand while the light is soft. Later, keep things unhurried and outdoors if you can, with pauses for water and shade when the sun flexes.",
