    "weather_report": "As twilight softly blankets Downtown San Francisco, the evening air carries a heavy promise of rain. The city sits under a woolly, cloud-laden sky, with a palpable chill just above the horizon. The temperature is hovering around a cool 54 degrees, with an uptick toward 57 as the night deepens. A formidable south-southwest wind is making its presence felt, brushing against the buildings and swirling through the streets, creating a scene that invites both reflection and introspection as gusts reach upward of 31 mph. Expect the promise of rain to unfold in earnest tonight, with a 90 percent chance of precipitation; droplets are likely to vary between three-quarters of an inch to an inch, further dampening the festive echoes of the day.\n\nAs Friday dawns, the uncertainty of rain lingers until morning breaks, shifting to a 30 percent chance of showers before 8 AM. The day may still grapple with stubborn clouds, veiling the sun from cloistered facets of the city. With highs reaching a gentle 60 before cascading into cooler afternoon temperatures around 56, a brisk west wind at 9 to 15 mph will accompany your explorations, swirling the cool, crisp air around you. Embrace the weather by wrapping yourself in layers; a comfortable sweater or light jacket combined with sturdy footwear will keep you warm and ready to face the elements. With city streets glistening from the night's rain, consider a leisurely stroll through the Presidio or along the waterfront, pausing perhaps at a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink as you watch the clouds play with the light.",
