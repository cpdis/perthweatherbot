    "weather_report": "Evening has settled over Subiaco with a clean sky broken only by a few idle clouds, the last glow softening the rooftops and pushing the UV to near nothing. The day ran clear and bright, the sun generous but not harsh; visibility stayed crisp, colors true, and the air felt tidy rather than heavy. Now it\u2019s a gentle, breathable night, the kind that invites unhurried steps and easy conversation.\n\nDress with a light layer\u2014something you can shrug on and off without thinking\u2014and comfortable shoes for a brief stroll. With the weather steady and cooperative, consider a small errand on foot, a loop around the block with the dog, or a quiet sit on the balcony while the sky deepens. Windows can stay cracked for fresh air, and if you\u2019ve a book to finish or a call to make, this is the hour: clear, calm, and pleasantly uneventful.",
