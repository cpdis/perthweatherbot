    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco arrives clean and uncomplicated: a bright, polished sky with that cool, early edge that makes the sun feel kind. The day looks set to stay clear through late morning and into midafternoon, so expect a generous, unhindered light and crisp visibility. As the sun lifts, the UV will nudge into moderate territory; by lunchtime it will have some bite, worth a hat, sunglasses, and a swipe of sunscreen if you linger outdoors.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for light layers you can peel back as the air softens, a long-sleeve over a tee, comfortable shoes for a few unhurried blocks. With the sky so open, errands feel easier: a stroll to the grocer, hanging laundry to dry, a coffee at a quiet table where the light pools, or a small tidy-up in the garden. If you\u2019ve a mind to move, a gentle bike ride for a nearby appointment suits the mood just right.",
