    "weather_report": "As the twilight wraps Downtown San Francisco in a soft, gentle embrace, the evening brings a touch of coolness, a relaxation from the day\u2019s busy pace. The forecast suggests a low around 49 degrees tonight, with a light north-northwest breeze whispering between 5 to 15 mph, occasionally gusting to 25. While the visibility may wane with the setting sun, clouds part to allow a distant view of the shimmering lights of the city, though hints of fog linger along the coastal edges, a reminder of the ocean's proximity. \n\nTomorrow, the dawn is expected to spill forth sunshine, igniting the hills and streets with warmth as temperatures climb to near 64, though they will gently recede to 61 by afternoon. It is a day that promises clarity and brightness, yet one should not forget the brisk north wind, rustling through the trees and along the avenues, nudging the chill into the air. As you consider your attire, a light jacket layered over a turtleneck will serve well among the changing temperatures, allowing you to savor a nippy stroll through the parks or enjoy the vibrant scenes of the waterfront. Given the inviting sun and refreshing breeze, this is a perfect opportunity to explore the quieter corners of the city, maybe visiting that new bistro you\u2019ve heard whispers about, or simply finding a cozy spot to watch the world as it passes by, warming to the charm that only a San Francisco day can offer.",
