    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a gauzy lid of cloud; the light is pewter and the air smells rinsed. Mid\u2011morning feels calm but unsettled, with light showers expected to wander in from late morning into the early afternoon, more a persistent patter than a downpour. Sunshine will be scarce, veiled and fleeting at best, and while spring UV can still nip around midday, the cloud should keep it mostly tempered. The day looks soft-focused and quiet, with edges blurred and colors subdued, inviting a slower pace.\n\nDress for comfort and drizzle: a light waterproof or trench, breathable layers, and shoes you don\u2019t mind getting speckled; slip an umbrella in your bag rather than a heavy coat. It\u2019s a good morning for an unhurried coffee, a browse through a shop or two, or a matinee after lunch; if you want air, take a gentle stroll between showers, then duck back inside when the next silver curtain moves through.",
