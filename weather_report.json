    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun bathes the city in a welcoming glow, casting long shadows and illuminating vibrant facades with a soft luster. As the high climbs near fifty-eight, the gentle kiss of a northwest wind around eighteen miles per hour adds a briskness that invigorates the senses. Clouds drift lazily overhead, leaving a canvas of blue that enchants even the most indifferent of passersby. Despite the season, the air remains surprisingly clear, suggesting that any fog could be lingering at the bay\u2019s edges, reluctant to encroach upon the lively streets.\n\nAs daylight wanes into evening, partly cloudy skies will cradle the city, with temperatures dipping to a comfortable forty-five. A lighter breeze will whisper through the alleys, perfect for a light jacket or a cozy sweater. This is a day best spent wandering through the Painted Ladies or savoring a quiet moment in a neighborhood caf\u00e9, perhaps with a warm drink in hand. The ambiance encourages strolls along the waterfront, where the serene views beckon, inviting you to linger a little longer as the city unfurls its evening charm.",
