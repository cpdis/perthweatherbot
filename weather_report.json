    "weather_report": "Night has settled over Centennial Park with a calm, inky sky that earlier wore only a few clouds before thickening into a broken quilt. At this hour the UV is essentially asleep, and the moon, where it finds a gap, lends a cool wash to the paths. The air feels steady rather than sharp, and visibility is serviceable under the softened glow. Toward morning, expect a mix of lingering cloud and occasional thin breaks; any sunshine should arrive filtered, gentle rather than glaring, with UV low early and only modest if the gaps widen later.\n\nIt\u2019s a night for simple comforts: a light jacket or soft sweater, sleeves you can push up if you get moving, and comfortable shoes for an unhurried lap. If you plan to be out past first light, consider sunglasses and a hat in case the sun slips through. The mood favors small, ordinary rituals\u2014walking the dog along the quieter loops, stretching by the water, or carrying a warm cup and a few pages to read while the day figures itself out.",
