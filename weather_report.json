    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is shrouded in dark clouds, presaging the rain that is expected to fall this afternoon. The air carries a damp chill, with temperatures hovering around 57, as the wind whispers secrets from the south and southwest at about 14 miles per hour. Rays of sunlight are but a memory today, replaced by a drab palate of grays that sweep across the cityscape, weaving a thick tapestry that dims the view towards landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, now hidden behind a veil of precipitation. The forecast hints at a continual dance with rain, suggesting more than just a passing shower; rather, an intimate embrace of the damp world that settles in for the evening.\n\nDress in layers if you venture outside, for the cool air will feel even brisker amid the moist chill, and a waterproof jacket will serve you well. Perhaps enjoy a leisurely stroll with an umbrella in hand, or seek refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, relishing a warm cup of coffee as you watch the world drift by through mist-clad windows. The evening promises a cloud-cloaked serenity, perfect for sipping tea while the rain taps gently against the glass, a soothing accompaniment to the quietude of the city.",
