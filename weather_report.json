    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco the sky is swept clean, a quiet navy canopy just beginning to pale; the air feels gentle and a touch brisk, the kind that makes the first breath on the veranda taste new. The forecast shows a cloudless morning from around sunrise onward, so expect full, unfiltered sunshine once the light tips the jacarandas. UV will rise quickly\u2014low at first light, then high to very high by late morning\u2014so the glare will turn hard-edged as the day matures. Visibility should be crystalline, shadows crisp, colors vivid; a day more buoyant than heavy.\n\nDress for a cool start and a bright finish: a light layer over breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen, with water close at hand. These early hours are perfect for a gentle walk to a coffee window, a quick spin to clear simple errands before the sun flexes, hanging a wash that will dry in a whisper of time, or taking a book to a patch of shade after breakfast. If you plan to linger outdoors, slide plans to the edges of the day where the light is kind.",
