    "weather_report": "As the evening cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the rain falls steadily, shrouding the city in a whisper of moisture and the soft sound of droplets tapping on pavement. The air is thick with the embrace of cloud cover, leaving the skyline blurred and indistinguishable from the muted surroundings. Temperatures hover in the cool embrace of the low fifties, offering a damp chill that seeps into threads. The south-southeast wind, howling at around 14 mph with gusts that echo off the buildings, adds to the sense of urgency in the atmosphere; it feels both alive and somber.\n\nLooking to Saturday, the horizon promises more of the same\u2014a persistent downpour accompanied by gusty winds that might prompt you to rethink your plans outdoors. In such weather, a warm, water-resistant jacket paired with comfortable shoes is advisable, as each step through puddles reminds one of the beauty in simplicity. With evening settling in, perhaps a quiet night indoors with a book or engaging a close friend in conversation over warm tea could reveal a charm all its own. The unexpected delights of solace found between raindrops and the glow of soft lights could prove as magical as any sunny day.",
