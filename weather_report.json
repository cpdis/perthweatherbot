    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the city is cloaked in a muted palette of gray clouds laden with rain, bringing with it a symphony of showers and the occasional peal of thunder. The air carries a palpable chill as the temperature steadily slides to a damp embrace near the mid-fifties. Winds out of the west-southwest gust and swirl, adding to the sense of movement gracing the blustery San Francisco sky. With a 90% chance of precipitation, it is wise to expect puddles and perhaps even the charm of a thunderous sky interspersed with sunlight later on.\n\nAs night descends, the showers will calm, yielding into a night that slowly reveals clarity among the lingering clouds. The temperature will dip to a cool 44, in stark contrast to the day\u2019s tumult. It is a good time to don a warm jacket\u2014preferably waterproof\u2014and perhaps a sturdy pair of shoes, as the ground will be slick from the rainfall. Indoor activities might beckon this evening: settling in with a good book or enjoying art at a local gallery could complement the coziness of the weather. Alternatively, finding a caf\u00e9 with a steaming brew and a cozy corner, where the world outside blurs in raindrops, presents a delightful way to unwind.",
