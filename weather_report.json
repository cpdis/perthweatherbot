    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts into late afternoon under a clean, glassy sky, the light turning honeyed and long. It feels bright but no longer brash; the midday bite of the sun has softened to a gentler warmth, with UV easing from earlier highs to something more forgiving, though a dab of sunscreen still earns its keep until the sun slips away. The air looks clear and crisp, edges of buildings and gums drawn in fine relief, a day that invites unhurried glances upward.\n\nExpect the evening to stay cloudless and calm, with the glow giving way to a placid, starry dark. It reads as quietly pleasant: good for finishing errands on foot, hanging the last load of washing to catch the last rays, or lingering at a small table outdoors with something cold. Dress in light layers with sunglasses now, then a soft jumper in your bag for after dusk. If you\u2019ve time, take a simple loop around the neighborhood before dinner; let the light do the talking and keep your plans comfortably small.",
