    "weather_report": "Dawn in Subiaco arrives muted and soft, the streets slicked with a light, persistent rain that tamps down the dust and hushes the birds. Expect showers to loiter through the morning with a low, pewter sky; sunshine will be stingy at first, with only brief, washed-out glimmers if the cloud thins toward late morning. UV stays gentle at this hour but can rise quickly if a few brighter breaks appear around midday, so pack a small umbrella and a dab of sunscreen alongside a light waterproof and shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles. The air has that clean, linen smell after rain, and visibility is a touch gauzy, the world rendered in softer edges.\n\nIt looks like a day for unhurried errands under awnings, a second coffee by a window, or a quiet browse in a bookshop while showers patter. If the rain eases, a short stroll through the back streets will feel contemplative rather than brisk. Let the weather set the tempo, and dress for comfort: layers you can peel, a hood you trust, pockets for patience.",
