    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds with a persistent blanket of clouds, the weight of impending rain lingering in the air. As Veterans Day progresses, a steady rain is anticipated until late afternoon, accompanied by a gentle breeze from the southwest. The high may graze the 60s, but as the day noticeably cools, a sense of chill will settle in, making it feel perhaps a touch cooler as the temperature dips toward evening. As the rain tapers off, a slight chance of drizzle remains, leaving behind a dampness that cloaks the city\u2019s charm in a muted palette.\n\nWith visibility obscured by a thick marine layer, the iconic landmarks fade into the mist. The Golden Gate Bridge, a shroud of fog, seems a whisper among the clouds, rendering the view somewhat melancholic yet serene. A sensible layer\u2014a light jacket may prove wise, complemented by a scarf to ward off the cool air. For activities, consider the cozy confines of a local caf\u00e9, where the scent of fresh coffee mingles with the soft whispers of conversation, or embrace the character of the day with a leisurely visit to an indoor gallery, relishing the art that thrives against the dampness outside. The atmosphere invites contemplation, perfect for losing oneself in the pages of a well-loved book or engaging in quiet conversation with a friend.",
