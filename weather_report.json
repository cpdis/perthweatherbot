    "weather_report": "Dusk has already settled over Bend, the last color drained from the high desert and replaced by a soft, pewter sky. Clouds thicken and, as evening deepens, light rain drifts in and lingers through the late hours, turning sidewalks slick and the air resinous with wet pine. There will be no sun to speak of now, and the UV index is essentially nil; clarity is muted, edges blurred under streetlamps, a quiet hush hanging over the neighborhoods.\n\nIt\u2019s a gently gloomy, companionable kind of night. Dress for damp and chill\u2014a waterproof shell over a warm layer, a knit hat, shoes with decent grip. If you head out, keep it simple: a short walk between showers, a stop by a cozy caf\u00e9 or corner taproom, a quick grocery run before the racks empty. Indoors suits the mood just as well: sort a drawer, sketch out tomorrow\u2019s list, stretch on the living-room rug, or let a pot simmer while the rain does its patient work outside.",
