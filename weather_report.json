    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Katy with scattered clouds drifting like loose pages across a deepening sky. It isn\u2019t a sunny night, of course; the UV rests near nothing, and the air feels open and uncomplicated, the kind that lets distant streetlights glow a little softer. Visibility should be decent beneath the breaks, with a few stars peeking through where the clouds thin.\n\nThrough late evening into midnight, those patchy clouds are expected to linger, offering a muted, peaceful night and, by early dawn, a sunrise likely filtered rather than blazing. No obvious hints of rain in the slices of forecast at hand. A light layer or soft sweater will suit the mild Gulf evening; add a windbreaker if you\u2019re easily chilled. It\u2019s a good time for an unhurried neighborhood stroll, a quiet porch sit with a warm drink, organizing tomorrow\u2019s list, or a brief drive with the windows cracked to let in the night air before turning in.",
