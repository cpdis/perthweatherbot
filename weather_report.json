    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle rain persists, illuminating the narrow streets with a soft, silken sheen. The clouds cling to the skyline, draping the city in a muted grey as the winds whisper around 12 mph, suggesting a briskness that settles into the bones. With temperatures lingering near 54 degrees, this morning invites an embrace of warmth\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater paired with a waterproof jacket would best suit the day ahead. \n\nAs we venture into Veterans Day, the rain will hold its ground until late afternoon, spilling gently from the heavens, before giving way to sporadic drizzle and perhaps even glimpses of blue skies battling for attention. A high of approximately 60 promises to bring a slight increase in warmth but expect a noticeable drop as the afternoon wanes into evening. The marine layer, heavy and determined, will likely hang low, obscuring the iconic views often celebrated in sunlight. For the unrefined adventurer, this day offers a quiet charm; strolls through the neighborhood caf\u00e9s may yield delightful conversations, and a visit to the local bookshop could provide the perfect refuge from the cool, damp air. Today navigates the delicate balance between the comfort of home and the pull of the world outside, cloaked in the soft embrace of a rainy San Francisco day.",
