    "weather_report": "As the clock gently ticks past two in the afternoon in Subiaco, the sky remains an unbroken canvas of azure, unmarred by the clouds that sparingly paint other days. This clear sky, heralded by the early predictions, allows the sun to cast its warm, golden brushstrokes over the city, invoking a serene transparency that highlights the first few days of autumn. The air whispers promises of a crisp, invigorating brightness, with the UV rays maintaining a considerate intensity that dances between warmth and caution. Donning a light jacket or an airy blouse will suit you well, an embrace of the day\u2019s tender warmth with a nod to the lingering coolness of the fading morning chill. Now is the ideal moment to embrace the outdoors, relishing the texture of a beautifully laid-out garden perhaps, or wandering through narrow, sunlit streets. Consider sauntering to a nearby cafe, where the chairs beckon you from sidewalk corners to sip leisurely on freshly brewed coffee, watching the world steeped in its afternoon glow. Find solace in the quiet hum of nature, allowing the day to unfold with the simplicity that often hides in plain sight, promising tranquility in the midst of routine.",
