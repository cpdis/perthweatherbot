    "weather_report": "Perth eases into the afternoon under a sky of shifting gauze: sunlit at present with patches of blue, then trending toward thicker, broken cloud by late day. Expect a bright, somewhat filtered sunshine rather than a clean blaze; the air feels clear enough for long views, but the light grows gentler as the afternoon advances. UV will be strong to very strong around now despite the cloud, softening a touch as cover builds toward evening.\n\nIt looks like a day for easy, unhurried errands and small pleasures. Wear light, breathable layers, a wide-brim hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen; tuck a light top in your bag for when the breeze turns cooler later. A shaded veranda lunch, a quiet loop to the shops on foot, a short riverside amble before the thicker cloud, or tending the garden and hanging the wash while the sun still peeks through would all suit. If you\u2019d rather be indoors, slip into the library or a small gallery for an hour, then step back out into that mellowing light.",
