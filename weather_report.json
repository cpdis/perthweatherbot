    "weather_report": "Fulshear wakes under a hushed, star-salted sky, the kind of clear, predawn stillness that makes the streetlights look thoughtful. After an evening of cloudless calm, the night remains crisp and clean, with long, quiet views and no hint of haze. It feels gently chilly now, the sort of hour that favors a warm cup and a sweater at the window while you watch the horizon think about light.\n\nOnce the sun steps up, expect a sun-forward day\u2014bright and uncomplicated\u2014with skies staying clear and the air looking freshly polished. The winter sun will be mild at first, with UV low early, nudging to moderate by midday; sunglasses and a light dab of sunscreen will serve you well. Dress in easy layers: a light jacket or cardigan for the morning, something breathable beneath for the afternoon. It\u2019s a pleasant day for ordinary graces\u2014an unhurried neighborhood walk after sunrise, a grocery run before the rush, tidying the porch, washing the car, or reading by a sunny window as the house slowly warms.",
