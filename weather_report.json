    "weather_report": "Evening softly descends upon Subiaco, drawing the veil of a day set to be lightly shrouded by scattered cloud formations. The ethereal tracery of broken clouds, like the lofty ceiling of an open-air cathedral, promises a day of muted sunlight and gentle shade. Under this cloak of reprieve from the harsh sun, the mellow rays should not cause worry for those cautious of chalking up the UV index. Yet, those seeking the comfort of the sun's heat may need to strain for that elusive sensation. The clarity of day is filtered, the sun's brilliance softened by the ever-changing tableau of clouds, conjuring up imagery of impressionist masterpieces - lullabies in light and shadow. \n\nAs the day unfurls, one is advised to pair casual attire with a light cardigan or jacket, straddling the space between the cool of residual morning crispness and the incredibly soft warmth that the diffused sunlight permits. A perfect day, one might ruminate, for an unhurried stroll \u2013 to appreciate the shifting cloud patterns or savor the tranquility of a leisurely alfresco brunch in the low-hanging sunlight. Such is the day in Subiaco, shrouded in a comforting cloak of broken clouds, paving the way for the pacifying embrace of the evening.",
