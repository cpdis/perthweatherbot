    "weather_report": "In the wee hours of the morning, the picturesque town of Subiaco is softly blanketed by a delicate drizzle, each droplet shimmering like tiny pearls as they lazily make their descent. The vitality of the morning is subdued by the mellow touch of lingering coolness, whispering the secrets of the night left behind. As light seeps into the day, it crisply interlaces with the silver sheen of rain, causing the entire place to glow with an ethereal glisten that subtly enhances the inherent charm of Subiaco. \n\nThough it's expected the sky will echo with the same intricate ballet of rain throughout the new day, don't let it dampen your spirits. The gentle weather brings with it a great opportunity to dust off those delicately plaid raincoats and prance out to breathe in a sublime symphony of earthy petrichor and sweet floral breeze. A well-curated book by your favorite author, enjoyed at your local caf\u00e9 would complement the day perfectly. Its windows be-speckled with raindrops would offer the perfect frame to enjoy nature\u2019s rhythm. So, adorn your day with quiet contentment, let the whispering drizzle transport you to a realm of internal tranquility and savor the subdued palette of Subiaco's charm.",
