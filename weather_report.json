    "weather_report": "Swanbourne has slipped into a quiet, crystalline night. The sky is clear and clean-edged, stars set like pins in blue velvet, and the air carries that uncomplicated November cool that straightens the spine. UV is effectively nil at this hour, and the clarity is striking; sounds travel, breath hangs briefly, and the village feels tidied by the dark.\n\nThrough the small hours the serenity holds, and dawn should arrive on a pale, unclouded stage. If the clear spell lingers, expect a bright but gentle sun and a seasonally low UV index; more sparkle than heat. Dress for the hush: warm layers, a proper coat, maybe a scarf for the early errand or dog round. Good moments now are modest ones\u2014step out to check the night\u2019s stillness, set the kettle, lay out tomorrow\u2019s bits and pieces\u2014then, come first light, an unhurried walk to meet the day, or a window seat where the thin sunshine can find your hands.",
