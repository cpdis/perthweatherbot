    "weather_report": "Osborne Park wakes to a clear dome of sky and clean, bright light; shadows are already crisp at mid-morning, the air feeling open and uncomplicated. With the forecast calling for clear skies through late morning and into the afternoon, expect unfiltered sunshine and a very high UV punch as midday approaches. The day looks beautifully clear, colors saturated, edges sharp, the kind of clarity that makes everything feel lightly polished and a little exposed.\n\nDress for glare and warmth: light, breathable layers, a broad-brim hat, sunglasses, and diligent sunscreen; carry water if you\u2019re stepping out. This is a pleasant morning for a short errand on foot, hanging the wash to dry, or a quick circuit through the park before the sun turns brassy. If you\u2019re staying indoors, throw open a window and let the light in while you sort a drawer, water a stubborn plant, or flip through a book by the window; save a longer wander for late afternoon when the light softens and the edges blur.",
