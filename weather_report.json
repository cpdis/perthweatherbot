The soothing whisper of a north-northeast breeze flows through the streets, adding a slight chill that hints at the winter night ahead. As the hours pass, the familiar dance of fog is likely to grace the early hours, seemingly wrapping the landscape in a tender shroud, before yielding to a partly sunny day\u2014a touch of brightness breaking through as the fog retreats. \n\nFriday promises a gentle awakening, where patches of fog may linger, dissipating just in time to reveal a moderately pleasant day with temperatures peaking near 59 degrees. As the sun approaches its zenith, the mercury will gently slide downwards, encouraging a light jacket or sweater for comfort during the afternoon strolls. The northeast breeze remains, a subtle reminder of nature's breath, inviting denizens of the city to explore the vibrant streets. Perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or a quiet moment in a sunlit park would be perfect\u2014simple joys that resonate beautifully in the mild December air.",
