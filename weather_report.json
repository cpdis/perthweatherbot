    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, with the sun\u2019s warm rays embracing the coolness of the brisk air. Temperatures hover around the mid-fifties, offering a gentle reprieve from the usual chill, although they may fall slightly as the day progresses. A light northwesterly wind dances through the streets, complementing the clarity of the day, with only a few clouds lazily drifting overhead.\n\nAs evening falls, the clouds will gather just a bit more, but they won\u2019t overshadow the charm of the city. The low will dip to a crisp forty-six degrees, inviting you to don a cozy layer or two\u2014perhaps a snug sweater or a light jacket to ward off the evening chill. With the picturesque backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge visible in the distance and the city lights beginning to twinkle, a leisurely walk along the waterfront could be the perfect way to appreciate the vibrant life of the city at this time. Alternatively, settling down with a book at a favorite caf\u00e9, warmed by a steaming cup of coffee, could be just as delightful, allowing the ambiance of San Francisco to envelop you as the day gently fades into night.",
