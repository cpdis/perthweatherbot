    "weather_report": "The early hours in Downtown San Francisco unveil a landscape shrouded in a gentle blanket of clouds, casting soft shadows across the city. As the hours approach dawn, the temperature lingers near a cool 48 degrees, setting the stage for a serene yet slightly overcast ambiance. The calm west-northwest wind whispers through the streets, hinting at the promise of a warmer afternoon. With Washington's Birthday unfurling ahead, residents can anticipate a gradual warming, culminating in highs around 57 degrees, before gently dipping to 55 in the afternoon.\n\nDespite the clouds, the day carries a certain charm, encouraging leisurely pursuits among the city\u2019s iconic streets. Infused with a hint of the ocean's breath, fog may weave in and out; it tends to grace the edges of the Golden Gate and the coastline, lingering where the land meets the sea. This might invite a cozy sweater or a light jacket, offering warmth against the cool breezes while still respecting the fleeting sun that may peek through. The city's mix of history and modernity thrives under this subtle weather veil, suggesting simple yet delightful activities\u2014perhaps a stroll through the Mission for a coffee, or exploring one of the many underrated parks tucked amidst the urban sprawl. There\u2019s an inviting sense of anticipation laced into the day, beckoning one to embrace the understated beauty of this vibrant metropolis.",
