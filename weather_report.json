    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Denmark with a soft, persistent patter; the streets wear a lacquered sheen, and the horizon is smudged under a low, obliging sky. Light rain moved in through late afternoon and lingered into nightfall, and it\u2019s still with us now\u2014gentle, but enough to bead on sleeves and turn puddles into small mirrors. Sunshine was scarce today and is done for; the UV index is effectively nil, and the air feels clean but a little hazy, like looking through smoked glass.\n\nExpect on-and-off light showers to keep the night subdued and intimate. It\u2019s a jacket-and-hood sort of evening; choose a light waterproof layer and shoes you don\u2019t mind getting damp, and keep an umbrella handy if you prefer to stay dry between doorways. Good weather for simple comforts: a quiet tram ride home, a quick loop around the block between drops, a detour to a bookstore or bakery, or letting a pot simmer while the rain ticks at the window.",
