    "weather_report": "The morning sun casts a gentle brilliance over Downtown San Francisco, awakening life with a promising partly sunny sky. The temperature hovers just below sixty degrees, and a soft breeze from the southeast stirs the air, making it a pleasant time for a stroll along the waterfront. Yet, there\u2019s a hint of mystery as clouds gather in the background, indicating the rain to come. As day wanes, expect the clouds to thicken, heralding a shift in the atmosphere. By early evening, a steadfast rain will sweep in, with the winds picking up, nudging the temperature upward while the chance of precipitation looms at a significant 80 percent.\n\nFor those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater layered over a long-sleeve shirt provides warmth against the cool breeze, while waterproof footwear would be wise as the city prepares for the moisture of the night. A leisurely afternoon might invite exploration of hidden bookstores or quiet caf\u00e9s, with a promise of warmth indoors before the rain arrives. Embracing the elements evokes a certain charm\u2014perhaps even an impromptu visit to the coast where the waves, kissed with glimmers of sunlight, offer a moment of serenity before the storm.",
