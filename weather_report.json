    "weather_report": "Perth wakes under a soft, pearly sky, the sun slipping in and out of broken cloud so the streets alternately gleam and hush. By late morning and into the early afternoon those clouds will keep drifting overhead, offering bright intervals rather than a hard blaze. The air feels kindly and clear, the horizon a touch gauzy, and while the light is filtered, the spring sun still has teeth; expect the UV to climb quickly toward midday even with the patchwork shade.\n\nDress for an easy day: light, breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a dab of sunscreen on the nose and forearms. It\u2019s a good morning for quiet errands on foot, a meander around Hyde Park or along the river while the glare is softened, or a coffee taken on a shaded verandah with the paper folded just so. If you\u2019re staying in, throw open a window and tend to a few plants or sort a bookshelf by the window, letting the changing light do its gentle work.",
