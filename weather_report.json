    "weather_report": "Morning in Subiaco arrives clear and bright, the sun sharpening verandah shadows and giving the streets that freshly washed look. Forecasts promise a mostly open sky through the late morning with only a few hesitant clouds drifting in later, so the light will be clean and generous, the sort that makes colors pop and edges gleam. It will feel pleasant overall, though the midday glare will have some bite, and the UV is set to run high, especially as the sun climbs.\n\nDress for ease: breathable layers, short sleeves, a brimmed hat and sunglasses, with sunscreen as routine as your keys. This is a good day to do things slowly and nearby\u2014walk the small errands, pause at a caf\u00e9 under an awning, water the herbs on the balcony, or hang a fresh wash in the sun. If you fancy a stretch of the legs, take a mid-morning stroll before the brightness leans toward fierce, then drift back into the shade and let the afternoon idle along with a book.",
