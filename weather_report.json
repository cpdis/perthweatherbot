    "weather_report": "As evening drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crisp clarity, reminiscent of autumn's cool embrace. The temperatures hover around the low 50s, with a gentle north-northeast breeze whispering through the city streets. The night sky is mostly clouded, yet the twinkling city lights pierce through the gray, casting a warm glow against the somber backdrop. Tonight, the forecast hints at a gradual warming, as if the city is softly exhaling towards dawn. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, joy is found in the promise of a mostly sunny day, with the sun anticipated to reach its zenith around the early afternoon, easing the chill and bringing warmth around 62 degrees. While the marine layer may linger along the edges of the bay, the heart of the city is expected to bask in the sunshine, painting a picture of ideal conditions for a day spent wandering through the Cult of Coffee or visiting the hidden gems that adorn the Mission District. Dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater with a spring jacket, as the coolness of the morning may flirt with the sun's mid-day embrace. As the day unfolds, seize this charming opportunity for leisurely strolls down the waterfront, or perhaps explore one of the many quaint bookshops that offer a cozy sanctuary from the autumn air.",
