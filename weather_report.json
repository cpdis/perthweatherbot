    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of rain settles upon the city, blurring the lines of familiarity. The air is thick with moisture, each breath tasting of the sea, and a gentle southeast wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the promise of more rain. Today, the sky looms heavy and gray, with temperatures hovering around the chilly mid-fifties, inviting a layer of warmth to the morning routine. Clouds gather like a quiet crowd, poised to release their burden, while the promise of shadows lingers in the air\u2014ideal for those who seek solace indoors.\n\nDress for the occasion might call for a sturdy raincoat and perhaps a soft scarf, cozy yet practical; after all, wandering through the verdant embrace of Golden Gate Park or enjoying a quiet moment by the bay is best done with a nod to the elements. Indoors, the atmosphere welcomes contemplation\u2014perhaps a stroll through the halls of an art gallery or finding a nook in a cafe that beckons with the scent of freshly brewed coffee. Amidst the drizzle, the city wears a melancholic charm, one that encourages connection, reflection, and the simple joys of a rainy day.",
