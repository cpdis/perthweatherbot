    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens in Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a serene clarity, with the night air crisp and cool, settling in around 44 degrees. A gentle east wind whispers through the streets, adding a touch of atmosphere to the evening. Tomorrow promises a golden embrace of sunshine, as the sun casts its warm rays down, reaching a mild high of 59. As afternoon approaches, an effortless transition to cooler temperatures will turn the day from bright to pleasantly mild.\n\nThe cityscape appears vibrant, with lights twinkling against the backdrop of the Bay. Tonight is devoid of fog; instead, a soft stillness prevails, creating an inviting environment for evening strolls or quiet moments spent at a cozy caf\u00e9. Layering in comfortable attire would suit this transitional weather well; perhaps a light sweater over a t-shirt, perfect for both warmth and mobility. It is an ideal time for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, or simply to enjoy the beauty of the bay, listening to the gentle lapping of waves against the shoreline amidst the fading sunlight and rising stars.",
