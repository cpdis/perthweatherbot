    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a soft melancholy hangs in the air, wrapping the city in an embrace of muted gray clouds. The rain, a gentle but persistent presence, promises to linger throughout the day. With temperatures drifting between the high fiftys, anyone venturing outside will want to dress in layers, perhaps donning a waterproof jacket and comfortable, snug shoes to navigate the damp streets. The swirling winds, whispering in from the south, add a chill to the day; they may guide you toward a cozy caf\u00e9 or a serene corner of the library where the sound of rain can lull you into peaceful contemplation.\n\nThe view towards the Golden Gate and the urban horizon is likely shrouded in a delicate veil of fog, the marine layer creeping through the alleys and streets, lending an air of mystery to the familiar skyline. The day\u2019s drizzle may deter outdoor adventurers, yet there is beauty in the sound of raindrops tapping against windows \u2013 a perfect backdrop for sipping tea while watching the city rhythm slow to its rainy day tempo. Whether you find solace in the soft glow of an art studio or the pages of an engaging novel tucked into your favorite nook, today offers opportunities for quiet reflection amidst the bustling life of this iconic city.",
