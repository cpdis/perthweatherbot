    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon sun pours over the city, illuminating streets and casting long shadows that dance with the gentle northwest breeze. With temperatures hovering near a brisk fifty-four degrees, those venturing outside will feel a pleasant chill, especially as the day begins to wind down. The skies above are a canvas of blue, unmarred by fog or haze, allowing for a clear view of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge standing proud in the distance. Yet, the forecast hints at a shift; as night approaches, an impending chance of rain flirts with the evening air, promising a gentle patter after 4 AM.\n\nAs the sun sets on this picture-perfect day and the evening chill settles, layering is advisable: perhaps a light jacket over a cozy sweater, perfect for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s. The atmosphere invites a leisurely exploration of the quieter streets, where the faint sounds of the city wind down. While it is not the day for beaches or picnics, it is an ideal time to sit with a warm drink, soaking in the tranquil mood of the twilight as the city\u2019s lights begin to twinkle like stars.",
