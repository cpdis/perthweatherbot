    "weather_report": "As the evening settles gently over Subiaco, the day has unfolded with the rhythmic patter of moderate rain that began earlier in the afternoon and continued into the early evening. The rain has washed the streets and stirred a cool, fresh scent into the air, leaving a glistening sheen on slick pavements and swaying leaves. With clouds ever-present, the sun has taken refuge behind the dense veil, casting the day in soft, muted tones and leaving little space for brilliance or brightness to poke through. The UV index has remained low, hidden away like a secret, with no burning rays to be wary of today.\n\nThe weather invites one to embrace the comfort of layered clothing, a light raincoat or a sturdy umbrella as your steadfast companion. Tonight, with the air fresh and rain receding, the mood is ripe for a quiet walk, perhaps with thoughts as your only company, enjoying the rare solitude offered by the gentle taps of lingering droplets. For those seeking warmth, the whisper of coffeehouses or your cozy kitchen with a freshly brewed cup calls alluringly. Under these sympathetic skies, creativity could be kindled \u2013 pen a letter to an old friend, or lose yourself in the pages of a book that has patiently awaited your return.",
