    "weather_report": "Under an ominous spell we find the city of Perth, where, in the fluky wee hours of the 26th of February, fragmented clouds loosely scatter across the indigo firmament. A hesitation lingers before the dawn arrives, as if whispering the secret of the upcoming day - an overture of broken clouds. Though the spectacle of sunlight won\u2019t be in its most exalted state, there's a gentle lament in the hushed glow that sifts through such a cloudy kaleidoscope, painting the day in soft luminescence. One can feel a certain melody in the cool air, a serenade to the city's quiet character under subdued skies. \n\nDressing for the day could be likened to preparing for a calm symphony; a light jumper to clad oneself against the whims of cloudy refrains, and perhaps a hat, but less for shade, and more in precognition of an unexpected drizzle. It's an opportune day, indeed, for those inclined to savor a cup of coffee outdoors under the capricious ballet of the clouds, or perhaps, absorb themselves in the mellow rhythm of the day with a good book in hand. Now, down to the world, Perth continues its daily sonnet under a veiled sunrise, obscure yet beautiful, vowing yet another day accented with the subtlety of nature\u2019s uncertainties.",
