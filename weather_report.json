It\u2019s not a sunny evening at all\u2014UV is effectively nil now\u2014and the sky looks set to grow more overcast toward the small hours, trading scattered patches for a broader, duller ceiling. The air feels calm and clear enough for easy visibility, the kind of night where the streetlights do most of the work and the horizon is more suggestion than line.\n\nIt\u2019s quietly pleasant rather than dazzling. A light layer will suit\u2014an easy sweater or a soft jacket if you linger outdoors. If you\u2019re stepping out, take an unhurried loop around the block or fetch a last-minute loaf for tomorrow\u2019s breakfast; if you\u2019re staying in, crack a window, put on a record, and tend to small, satisfying tasks: a tidy desk, a packed bag, a few pages of a book under a warm lamp. Expect more cloud as the night deepens and, with it, a gentler mood to carry you toward sleep.",
