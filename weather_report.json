    "weather_report": "Past midnight in Subiaco, a soft, unhurried rain salts the pavement and hushes the streets. The sky is a seamless quilt of cloud, with no moon to speak of and no hint of glare; UV is negligible, and the night feels dulled and close, the sort of damp that invites a warm mug and a slower breath.\n\nShowers look set to linger through the small hours, leaving a gray and slightly glistening start to the morning; any sunshine will be brief and bashful at best, with UV staying low until much later, if breaks appear. Dress for the drizzle: a light waterproof, sleeves you can roll, closed shoes that don\u2019t mind puddles, and an umbrella that knows its job. It\u2019s a night for winding down\u2014finish that chapter, queue tomorrow\u2019s playlist, set the rain jacket by the door. Come early morning, keep plans modest and flexible: a quiet coffee by the window, a short tram or bus ride instead of the bike, small errands between showers while the town yawns awake.",
