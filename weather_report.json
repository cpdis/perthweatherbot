    "weather_report": "As the afternoon opens its quiet palms over Subiaco, the sky is a canvas of scattered clouds, like delicate whispers woven through the blue. Earlier today, a light rain tiptoed through town, leaving its cool fingerprints on the air. It seems the rain has respectfully retreated, allowing the softened sun to peek through. While sunshine is limited by the playful floating shapes above, it lends a gentle glow to everything it caresses, and you may find the day neither too bright nor shadowed by gloom. Today's air, kissed by the rain's refreshing presence, invites a gentle stroll through nature's corridors or perhaps a leisurely moment on a patio with a book and a cup of tea in hand. The UV index won\u2019t reach unpleasant heights, allowing for comfort in wearing light layers without the necessity of sunblock. As the multifaceted hues of the day continue to unfold, be gentle to your senses. Relax with a lazy afternoon gathering of close friends or dive into an afternoon inspired by creative pursuits \u2014 whether sketching under a tree's gracious shade or crafting thoughts into words as the day continues to paint itself in its mellow palette.",
