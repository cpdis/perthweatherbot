The stars, obscured by a veil of retreating clouds, suggest a night softened by the whispers of an occasional breeze. With temperatures hovering around a cool 45 degrees, those venturing outside may find themselves yearning for a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater to ward off the chill. \n\nMoving into Sunday, the dawn will chase away the remnants of night with a promise of clarity. A mostly sunny day unfolds, unveiling smatterings of blue sky as golden light pours over the city. Highs will tease the mid-fifties, giving way to a slightly cooler afternoon as temperatures grace the low fifties. The air will carry a gentle northeast wind, wonderfully refreshing but not overwhelming. Although the fog may have retreated from its usual haunt, the coastal marine layer\u2014an ever-present entity\u2014may linger in the distance, offering a soft contrast to the sun\u2019s warmth. This pleasant climate will entice locals and visitors alike to wander through the tranquil streets, enjoy a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, or perhaps savor a quiet moment in one of the city's lovely parks. The coolness of the day suggests that a light scarf might be a welcome companion as you meander, thinking of the simple beauty that a San Francisco day can evoke.",
