    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a low, unbroken ceiling tonight; the stars are smudged out and the streets glow in soft, pewter light. It isn\u2019t sunny in the least and the UV bite is gone with the daylight, leaving a gentle, dim clarity where edges blur and sounds carry. The air feels calm rather than bleak, the sort of overcast that invites quieter voices and unhurried steps.\n\nClouds look set to linger through the late hours and likely into the small morning, so dawn may arrive muted and colorless. Any sunshine early will be shy, with UV staying tame until the sky decides otherwise. A light jacket or cardigan suits a brief after-dinner wander, and if you\u2019re staying in, warm socks and a cup of something simple will do. Good night for a meandering neighborhood stroll, a shelf straightened at last, or a slow chapter before bed; if you\u2019re up early, a coffee on the porch under a grey sky has its own quiet charm.",
