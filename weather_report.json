    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day awakens under a heavy sky, the promise of rain looming as droplets have already begun their descent. A brisk wind carries the unmistakable scent of the ocean, while the air is thick with anticipation for the deluge set to arrive before the sun bows out at four. Looking north towards the Golden Gate, the fog attempts to reclaim its territory, shrouding the bridge in a ghostly veil. The city\u2019s silhouette is mere whispers of color, muted against the approaching tempest.\n\nAs the storm softly raps on windows, it\u2019s a day best suited for layered attire\u2014perhaps a sturdy coat to shield you from the elements, accompanied by a hat to keep the persistent chill at bay. Mismatched but cozy scarves can add not just warmth, but a splash of vibrancy to the otherwise dreary palate. With the rain's embrace, the streets glisten, creating an opportunity for quiet contemplation over a hot cup of coffee or tea at a local caf\u00e9, where you may watch the world transform in the hazy blur of falling rain. Alternatively, for those intrepid enough to venture outside, a stroll along the waterfront can yield striking views\u2014water mingling with clouds, the city bustling with life even as the elements nap under drizzly skies.",
