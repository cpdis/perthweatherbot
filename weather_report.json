    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Subiaco, the sky is scrubbed clear, the kind of lucid night where stars feel close enough to pocket and the streets settle into a soft, humming quiet. The air has that spring cool that wakes the skin without biting, and everything seems neatly outlined, as if the city has been freshly drawn.\n\nThe small hours are set to stay cloudless through dawn, which should arrive clean and bright, the sun stepping in without filter. Expect a sunny start; once the light strengthens, the UV will climb quickly, so plan on sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen if you\u2019ll be out through late morning. It looks like a pleasant day rather than a punishing one: crisp early, then comfortably warm with sharp, clear views. Start with a light jumper or jacket and easy layers you can peel away. Good day for ordinary pleasures\u2014a quiet walk before the city stirs, coffee on a stoop, letting fresh air through the house, hanging laundry to catch the first light, a short cycle to run an errand. Keep it simple, unhurried, and let the clear sky do the talking.",
