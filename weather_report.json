    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning greets us with a splendid sunlit canvas. The air is crisp, teetering on the cool side, while the sky stretches out in a bright azure, affording a clear view of the day. While shadows of the past linger in the low-lying fog along the edges of the bay, they seem to ebb away, marking their territory only in whispers against the vastness of the scenery. Temperatures control their own descent throughout the day, beginning with a light chill that beckons for layers. As the afternoon unfolds, the warmth may momentarily tease, inviting the more adventurous to leave heavier jackets behind.\n\nFor those venturing out, the day holds an intimacy perfect for a leisurely stroll by the waterfront or a quiet coffee at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, where the sun pours in through large windows, illuminating the day with its golden touch. A light sweater or a jacket is advisable as the sun sinks towards the horizon, while an airy scarf could provide comfort against the briskest of breezes. This serene interlude, devoid of the fog's heavy cloak, turns the city into a delightful backdrop for simple joys\u2014be it a moment of reflection by the bay or the quiet satisfaction found in a well-spent afternoon.",
