    "weather_report": "Subiaco drifts into late afternoon under a mostly open sky, a few polite clouds sailing by as the light turns honeyed and forgiving. The sun still has a little brightness to it, but the edge has gone; UV is gentle now and sliding toward negligible as evening approaches. The air feels clean and settled, giving the streets a clear, well-defined look, the kind that makes brick and eucalyptus read a shade truer. Expect the rest of the day to stay fair and calm, clouds scattered like punctuation rather than plot.\n\nIt\u2019s pleasant in that unhurried, end-of-day way: warm enough for a stroll in shirtsleeves if you\u2019re moving, better with a light layer once you slow down. Sunglasses for the last glare, a cardigan for the first hint of cool. This is a good time to walk to the shops, water the pots, or sit in a courtyard and finish the thing you started earlier\u2014a chapter, a list, a letter\u2014while the light thins and the neighborhood settles.",
