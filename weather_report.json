    "weather_report": "Morning fog still lingers in pockets along the horizons of Downtown San Francisco, but as the sun rises higher, it transforms into an inviting light that mingles with the promise of a bright day. The chill of the early hours gives way to a pleasant warmth, with temperatures hovering around a moderate 56 degrees, providing a subtle balance amidst the crispness of the northwesterly breeze. As the day wears on, the skies will mostly clear, offering a glimpse of the iconic skyline against a dazzling blue background. However, a gentle retreat of the fog remains at the city's edges, nurturing the air with a hint of marine freshness.\n\nDressing in layers is advisable; perhaps a light sweater or a denim jacket for early outings, with the option to shed a layer as the sun asserts its presence. It's an ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the bustling streets or a quiet saunter along the waterfront, where the soft air carries a whisper of the ocean. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink or a takeout lunch at a nearby park might be just the right way to soak in the serenity of the city, as the muted sounds of the waking urban landscape resonate around you. Engage with the day\u2019s understated beauty and respect the dance of fog and sun that defines this unique locale.",
