    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, the city awakens under the subtle embrace of haze, which may linger just long enough to cast a gentle, muted glow over the skyline. As the hours advance, the forecast promises a transition to mostly sunny skies, revealing stark contrasts against the otherwise soft backdrop. The high will dance around a comfortable 62 degrees, gracefully tapering to a cooler 57 as afternoon shadows lengthen. A light breeze from the north-northwest, barely stirring at 6 mph, will lend a touch of movement to the already clearening atmosphere.\n\nTonight, the allure of the city continues with partly cloudy skies, a cover which may create a delicate tapestry of light and shadow, perfect for evening strolls through the quieter streets. As temperatures dip to around 47, a light jacket or sweater will be advisable, providing just enough warmth against the night\u2019s cool embrace. The conditions invite a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where one can savor the day\u2019s last rays and the night\u2019s first glimmers. With the marine layer cautiously retreating, the day unfolds as a cherished gift, beckoning you to step outside and relish the beauty of this coastal jewel.",
