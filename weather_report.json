    "weather_report": "The dawn has unfolded over Downtown San Francisco, where the faintest light stretches across a skyline gently draped in a blanket of calm. The air is crisp and carries a hint of the chill that marks this festive season. Currently, temperatures linger in the mid-40s, providing a refreshing contrast to the warmth of indoor celebrations. As the hours pass, the sun will rise high in a mostly clear sky, promising a high near the mid-50s. The transition from the cool morning to the mild afternoon will be soothing, as a gentle breeze whispers through the city.\n\nWhile the clarity is inviting, there\u2019s a subtle reminder of the bay's influence, with the marine layer hanging shyly just beyond the bridge, promising a day devoid of significant fog. Instead, a serene brightness will coat the city, perfect for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment basking in the sun at one of the city's many green parks. Given the necessity of layers, a light jacket or sweater will suffice for the morning chill, while a brisk walk through the streets or a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 might be the ideal way to embrace the spirit of the day. As the sun makes its ascent, savor each fleeting moment, perhaps wandering through the quiet streets and relishing in the festive atmosphere that lingers in the air.",
