    "weather_report": "As the city settles into the quiet of night, the clear skies above Downtown San Francisco offer a serene backdrop. The temperature gently drops to a comfortable 51, and the air remains still, stirred only by a whisper of wind. With no fog to obscure the view, the stars punctuate the darkness, casting a tranquil glow over the urban landscape. Tomorrow, residents can look forward to a sunny day unfolding under a playful mix of clouds and blue skies. The high will flirt with 65, before easing down to 61, inviting one to bask in the warmth of the afternoon sun. \n\nDressing in layers will serve you well, as the cool of morning yields to a milder afternoon; a light jacket or sweater tossed over a t-shirt will ensure comfort throughout the day\u2019s transformations. The absence of fog allows for a myriad of possibilities. A reflective stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps, followed by an afternoon spent in one of the city\u2019s parks\u2014where the sun filters through trees, creating a dappled haven for contemplation. If the mood strikes, exploring local cafes may offer an equally pleasant escape, where warmth, comfort, and community abound.",
