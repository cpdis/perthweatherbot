    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Busselton with a quilt of broken cloud drifting in from the bay, softening the shoreline and muting the last of the reflected light. The sun is long gone and the UV has slipped to nothing; through the late hours and into the small morning, expect the sky to stay mottled, the stars appearing in loose intervals between darker seams. It\u2019s a gentle, slightly damp maritime night rather than a cold one, the sort that makes colors go quiet and sounds carry. A light layer or a soft windbreaker will suit if you step out; canvas shoes will do fine. This is pleasant weather for a slow foreshore wander, a lap with the dog, or a seat on the veranda to let the sea air unspool the day. Views are calm but not crystal, the horizon brushed in charcoal and blue, inviting an unhurried pace and practical plans rather than bravado.",
