    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle marine layer lingers in the air, a veil of clouds cloaking the city's hills and highlighting the crispness of the morning. The current low settles around a balmy 52 degrees, hinting at a cool, moist embrace. With the sun slowly rising, a promise of a largely sunny Wednesday emerges, though the clouds will flit about, perhaps gifting us with intermittent glimmers of sunlight.\n\nForecasts suggest rain is likely to grace the city after the sun dips behind the horizon, adding an aura of intimacy as locals commence their evening routines. The brisk west-southwest winds will bring a refreshing chill, perfect for a light jacket or a cozy sweater, each layer a safeguard against the creeping coolness. As the day unfolds, you might consider meandering through the quieter streets, perhaps visiting an independent bookstore or indulging in a warm cup of coffee at your local caf\u00e9. Later, as the promise of rain materializes, embrace the opportunity to relish the moment as droplets begin to fall, reflecting the vibrant city lights in their shimmering dance.",
