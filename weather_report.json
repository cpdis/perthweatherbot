The forecast holds clear through the evening, with clean, dry air and excellent visibility; it feels reassuringly settled. The day has been very sunny and the UV sting earlier was no doubt assertive, but it\u2019s easing now and will drop quickly toward dusk. Expect a crisp, quiet night to follow, stars showing early with nothing to hide them.\n\nLight layers are the right idea: a breathable shirt for now, sunglasses and a hat if you\u2019ll linger before sunset, and a light sweater ready for when the warmth slips away. It\u2019s pleasant weather for modest tasks done unhurriedly\u2014finish an errand on foot, hang the last load of laundry to drink in the dry air, rinse the bike, or read a few pages on a bench while the light turns golden. Later, a short stroll after dinner should feel calm and clear rather than cold.",
