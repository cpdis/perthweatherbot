    "weather_report": "As the sun meanders toward the horizon in Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon presents a gentle embrace of partly sunny skies, where occasional breaks of light peek through the clouds. The temperature teeters near a cool yet comfortable 57 degrees, with a notable dip toward 55 as the day gradually yields to evening. The atmosphere remains comparatively clear for this time of year, though the lurking shadows of a marine layer suggest a whisper of fog that may cradle the Golden Gate Bridge as night approaches. \n\nAs twilight draws near, a tapestry of clouds thickens above, promising rain after 4 a.m. and enveloping the city in an impending blend of moisture-rich air, heralded by a soft southwest breeze. Residents should dress warmly, perhaps layering up with a light jacket to counteract the chill that often settles into the streets after sunset. Given the evening\u2019s cool invitation, a laid-back stroll through the city\u2019s hidden nooks or a cozy evening spent in a local caf\u00e9 would align well with the mood, allowing one to savor the subtle shift in the weather as the city readies itself for the rains to come.",
