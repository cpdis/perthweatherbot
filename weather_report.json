    "weather_report": "As the quiet dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city appears draped in a thick curtain of rain, a soft, persistent rhythm tapping against windows and sidewalks. The air carries a chill, hovering around an uninviting 50 degrees, with gusty winds whipping through the streets, lending a raw edge to the morning's preparations. The forecast promises a steady embrace of showers, transforming into occasional bursts of thunder, under a sky weighed down by heavy clouds, ensuring that visibility remains limited. \n\nThe veil of overcast heavens offers little in the way of warmth or cheer, casting a muted light that strips the city of its familiar vibrancy. Fog lurks in the distance, likely clinging to the coastal edges, and the marine layer will hold sway for much of the day. With temperatures expected to dip slightly in the afternoon, layering is advisable\u2014a sturdy jacket and perhaps a scarf are perfect companions for braving the wet elements. As one traverses the streets today, it may be best to seek refuge in cozy caf\u00e9s, sipping warm coffee while watching the rhythm of raindrops dance upon the cobblestones, or indulging in a leisurely visit to a local museum, where time slows down, and the world outside feels a heartbeat removed.",
