    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles into the small hours under a mostly clear sky, a few harmless clouds drifting like late thoughts. By the time dawn leans in, those wisps give way to a clean, open blue with bright, confident sunshine. The air should feel crisp at first light and turn pleasantly warm as the morning matures. Visibility looks sharp and colors will pop; glare will, too. With the clear sky, the UV index will climb quickly after sunrise and run high through late morning and midday, the sort that asks for respect even if the breeze feels kind.\n\nFor now, a light layer suits the quiet, then shift to breathable fabrics, sunglasses, a brimmed hat, and sunscreen once the day stretches its legs. It\u2019s a day that invites small, useful pleasures: an early walk while the shadows are long, a slow coffee before the streets wake, a tidy-up of the balcony plants, a midmorning trip to the shops, or a chapter of a book in the shade when the sun turns insistent. Laundry will dry briskly; pace yourself and keep to pockets of shade after late morning.",
