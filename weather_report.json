    "weather_report": "As the twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a gentle chill, reflective of a city settling into the cooler embrace of autumn. Tonight, under a mostly clear canopy, temperatures are expected to dip to a refreshing 48 degrees, coaxed only slightly by a soft south wind whispering at two to six miles per hour. The clarity of the evening offers a serene spectacle, revealing the twinkling lights of the bay and the softly illuminated skyline, with no fog to obscure the view. \n\nYet, as dawn approaches, a shift is on the horizon. Tomorrow promises rain after ten o'clock, shrouding the city in a veil of cloudiness that will see high temperatures hovering in the upper range of the twilight we now enjoy. The chance of precipitation looms at an 80% likelihood, suggesting a gentle but persistent drizzling throughout the day, with the potential for less than a tenth of an inch accumulation. For those venturing into the elements, layering becomes wise\u2014perhaps a lightweight waterproof jacket over a warm sweater, along with a sturdy umbrella tucked within arm's reach. Taking a stroll along the waterfront could bring solace, where the sound of raindrops harmonizes with waves lapping against the shore, inviting moments of quiet reflection amid the day-to-day bustle.",
