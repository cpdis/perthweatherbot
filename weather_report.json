    "weather_report": "As the afternoon settles in Scarborough, the sky offers a tapestry of broken clouds drifting lazily across a muted blue expanse. The sun occasionally peeks through, casting dappled patterns of light that play across the seaside town like a gentle artist sketching outlines in soft hues. The air carries a gentle touch, neither too warm nor too cool, inviting you to linger, to breathe it all in. Though the clouds obscure the sun at times, creating a patchwork canopy, the day still holds a charm of its own, a medley of grey and glimmers, inviting introspection.\n\nDressing for such a day demands a balance\u2014a light sweater and comfortable shoes to wander the historic streets and perhaps a hat just in case the sun decides to make a more definitive appearance. While today\u2019s UV index isn't aggressively high, some measure of skin protection remains wise. It\u2019s a day that coaxes you outdoors yet asks for no grand adventures, making it ideal for a leisurely stroll by the harbor or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where a warm drink and a view of the sea can accompany you on this aesthetically pleasing yet subdued afternoon.",
