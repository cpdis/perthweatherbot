    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours just past three, Downtown San Francisco cradles a delicate shroud of patchy fog, weaving through the streets and around the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge. The dawn reveals a city basking in a cool embrace, where the muted glow of streetlamps fights against the thickening daylight. The air is crisp, urging residents to don layers; a light jacket will serve well against the gentle north wind and the lingering chill of the night. \n\nAs the morning unfolds, the fog is expected to lift, giving way to partly sunny skies. The temperature will dance around a comfortable 58 degrees, as the clouds allow glimpses of blue, yet it won\u2019t quite reach the balmy warmth of the midday sun. There\u2019s a gentle charm in this kind of weather, perfect for leisurely strolls or sipping coffee at a local caf\u00e9, perhaps pausing to admire the soft hues of the city awakening. While not balmy, there's a certain tranquility to the day that invites quiet reflection or a spontaneous trip to a nearby museum for a dose of culture. Embrace the layered dressing; the day promises gentle shifts and, with them, delightful experiences.",
