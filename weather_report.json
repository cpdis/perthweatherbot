    "weather_report": "Perth wakes to a sky rinsed clean, the light already sharpening the edges of rooftops and gum leaves. Forecasts keep the slate simple: clear through late morning and into the afternoon, the sort of unbroken blue that invites confidence. Expect generous sunshine with UV climbing quickly and likely running high by midday, the air feeling clearer by the minute, shadows crisp and honest.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant day that warms with the hours. Dress in light, breathable layers, sunglasses on, a brimmed hat and sunscreen within reach. Good weather for ordinary pleasures: a walk to the shops, a quiet coffee outdoors, hanging a wash that will dry in no time, tending the balcony herbs, or a short ride on shaded streets. If you\u2019re out around lunch, seek patches of shade and keep a water bottle close; if you\u2019re at home, open a window and let the blue day do its steady work.",
