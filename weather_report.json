    "weather_report": "Just after midnight in Subiaco, the sky feels sealed and heavy, with a light, polite rain expected to drift through in the small hours and linger toward dawn. The streets will take on that pewter sheen, reflections stretching in the gutters, the air softened and quiet. It won\u2019t be sunny at daybreak; cloud will blunt the light and leave the morning a little hushed. UV is negligible overnight, low at first light, and will only matter later if the cloud breaks and the day brightens.\n\nExpect a mild, damp start that\u2019s more cozy than cruel. Dress for a sprinkle: a light waterproof or trench, closed shoes, and a compact umbrella. If you\u2019re up now, keep it gentle\u2014a warm drink, a small stretch, a page or two of something you\u2019ve been meaning to finish. Early commuters might leave a bit of buffer for slick platforms and slow traffic. After sunrise, plan relaxed, practical errands between showers; a window seat for breakfast, a grocery top-up, a tidy of the week\u2019s lists. If the cloud thins later, the light will sharpen and UV can climb quickly, so pocket sunglasses and sunscreen for the afternoon just in case.",
