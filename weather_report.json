    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past three in the morning, a soft rain whispers against downtown San Francisco, blanketing the streets in a gentle shroud. The air is cool and carries the briny scent of the nearby ocean, a reminder of the city\u2019s coastal embrace. Cloud cover hovers heavily above, dimming the stars and casting a muted palette over the cityscape. This evening's temperatures linger close to the mid-fifties, a chill that invites a cozy attire\u2014a well-fitted sweater layered under a waterproof jacket would be ideal. For those venturing out, perhaps a stroll through the quiet streets will yield the soothing rhythm of raindrops, accompanied by the occasional gust of wind dancing through the alleys.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the promise of an afternoon retreat from the rain takes shape. The clouds will persist, primarily cloaking the sun, but the chance of lingering rain diminishes in the light of day. Expect highs not much above fifty-nine degrees, gradually cooling as the day unfurls. Should you find yourself navigating the city by mid-morning, light layers and a reliable umbrella will serve well, while the texture of the day leans towards the muted\u2014a backdrop perfect for a warm caf\u00e9, where one can enjoy a hot drink while watching the world softly emerge from slumber. Whether admiring the art on display at a local gallery or simply walking the storied streets lined with history, today encourages a reflective pace, inviting moments of calm amid the city\u2019s gentle bustle.",
