The north-northeast wind carries whispers of the day\u2019s adventures, gently rustling leaves in quiet corners. As the city glimmers, shrouded in this subtle obscurity, it possesses an air of mystery that can be delightful for a twilight stroll among its urban pathways. \n\nTomorrow promises a shift as daylight breaks through the clouds, transforming the cityscape under mostly sunny skies, reaching highs just shy of 60. As the afternoon unfolds, the warmth will give way to a slight cool, hinting at the familiar presence of the marine layer just beyond the horizon. To navigate the day comfortably, one should embrace layers\u2014perhaps a cardigan over a light shirt, ready to shed warmth as the sun graces the streets. Friday's charms might best be enjoyed with a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with chatter\u2014an ideal setting to soak in the ambiance of this vibrant city perched on the bay.",
