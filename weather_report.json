    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the evening sky unfurls its blanket of clarity, punctuated only by the gentle glow of city lights reflecting on the cool air. As the night deepens, temperatures slide towards the upper forties, mingling with whispers of a soft south wind. It\u2019s a tranquil interlude before the clouds roll in with the dawn, promising a wet embrace by midday Sunday. Rain beckons from the horizon after 10 a.m., veiling the scene in a steady curtain, accompanied by temperatures that tend to linger in the mid-fifties, dampening the bright optimism of the week prior.\n\nAs you prepare for tomorrow, consider donning a light jacket, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater, to withstand the forecasted chill and impending drizzle. It\u2019s an ideal time for a simple yet satisfying day\u2014perhaps a quiet stroll beneath an umbrella along the Embarcadero, pausing to savor the aroma of coffee wafting from nearby cafes. Alternatively, venture into a local gallery or cozy bookstore, enveloped in the comforting escape from the elements. While the rain may cool the streets, it gifts San Francisco with an introspective mood perfect for savoring the city\u2019s hidden gems.",
