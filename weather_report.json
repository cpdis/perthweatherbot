    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp and invigorating, hinting at the characteristically cool embrace of the night. The low temperature, hovering around 47 degrees, invites a light jacket or sweater to ward off the chill of a north-northeast breeze. The interplay of darkness and scattered clouds lends a sense of serenity to the evening sky, offering just a touch of intrigue as the city lights twinkle below.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect a morning punctuated by patchy fog, creating a delicate veil over the bay that will gradually lift to reveal a partly sunny day. With highs reaching near 58, the afternoon promises a slight retreat in warmth, making an extra layer advisable for those venturing out. The gentle north wind will accompany the day, stirring a lightness in the atmosphere. Given these gentle, fleeting conditions, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 would be perfectly pleasant. As the fog begins to recede and the sun filters through, it's an ideal time to engage with the charm of the streets, perhaps enjoying a warm drink while taking in the eclectic rhythm of city life.",
