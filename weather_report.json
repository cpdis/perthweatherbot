    "weather_report": "Subiaco eases into night with a clean, ink-blue sky and the kind of clarity that makes distant lights feel nearer. The forecast holds steady and simple: clear now and clear as the hours slip past midnight. There\u2019s no sun at this hour and the UV index is essentially asleep, leaving the air gentle rather than demanding. It feels quietly pleasant, unhurried, a night that sharpens edges and softens voices; tomorrow\u2019s early sun, if the sky remains this bare, will wake bright and quickly, so plan shade and sunscreen once morning gets its footing.\n\nFor now, a light layer is enough if you\u2019re stepping out, perhaps a cardigan over short sleeves. This is good weather for the small domestic errands we otherwise postpone: a slow stroll to post a letter, watering the herbs, a tidy of the porch with the door propped open, or a brief step to the driveway to let your eyes adjust and pick out a familiar constellation. Keep it simple, keep it close to home, and let the clear night do the talking.",
