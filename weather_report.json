Clouds are thickening and a light rain is due around dusk, continuing into the evening\u2014the kind that dapples pavements and hushes the traffic rather than truly soaks it. The view stays clear enough but muted at the edges, colors slipping toward charcoal and eucalyptus as day folds into night. Dress for damp comfort: a light rain jacket or hooded layer, closed shoes, and something warm enough to keep the chill from settling in. Good hours for errands that live near awnings and doorways\u2014a quick grocery run, a slow browse in a bookshop, an early bite at a neighborhood cafe, or the train home with windows fogging slightly. If you\u2019re staying put, let the room glow and let the rain keep time.",
