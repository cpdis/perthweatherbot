    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the city basks under a mostly sunny sky, albeit with a gentle chill that hints at its coastal character, as temperatures hover around the low fifties. A soft west-southwest breeze lends a delicate touch to the serenity, crafting an atmosphere perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero. As the evening draws near, clouds gather their ranks, bringing a whisper of drizzle starting around ten o\u2019clock. The low will settle near forty-seven, creeping up slightly into the night, as a promise of moisture lingers in the air, with an eighty percent chance of light rainfall. \n\nCurrent visibility is clearer than it will soon be, though expect the familiar San Francisco fog to reclaim its territory later, particularly over the bay where the marine layer tends to thicken. Optimal attire today would include a light jacket or layered clothing, preparing one for the brisk evening temperatures and the impending dampness. As daylight fades, consider savoring a cup of coffee in one of the local caf\u00e9s, resting amid the murmurs of conversation and the sound of rain gently tapping on the windows\u2014a fitting way to unwind as the day transitions into a cozy night.",
