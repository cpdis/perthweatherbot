    "weather_report": "Subiaco slips into evening with a soft, patchwork sky: scattered clouds drifting past and letting a few quiet stars breathe through. Sunshine is behind us now, so UV is effectively nil; the night feels gentle and uncomplicated, with decent clarity between the passing tufts of cloud and no threat of wet. The mood is calm rather than crisp, the kind of air that invites a slower step and an easy breath.\n\nExpect the pattern to hold into late tonight and the small hours: broken cloud, otherwise dry and uneventful. A light layer will do for comfort\u2014something you can shrug on without thinking\u2014and if you run cool, tuck in a cardigan. It\u2019s a pleasant night for ordinary errands or small rituals: a leisurely walk to settle the mind, a quiet sit on the porch with a book, or a short wander to pick up a forgotten staple before tomorrow. Let the sky do its muted work while you do yours.",
