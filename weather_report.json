    "weather_report": "Dawn in Katy arrives under a quilt of broken clouds, the sky a soft gray-blue with hints of brightness pressing through. The day ahead looks gently lit rather than dazzling, with the sun playing peekaboo through the late morning and around midday. UV should stay on the mild side for winter, perhaps nudging to moderate when the sun finds a wider seam in the clouds. The air promises a calm, tempered clarity\u2014more diffused glow than sharp glare\u2014which makes the day feel easy on the eyes and unhurried.\n\nDress in light layers: a comfortable long-sleeve or sweater with a light jacket you can shed if the sun lingers. Sunglasses are optional but handy when those brighter intervals arrive. It\u2019s a pleasant morning for a quiet neighborhood walk, a coffee run, or tidying small errands without battling heat or harsh light; by late morning, a short bike ride or a meander through a local shop or market would suit the mood. If you\u2019re staying in, open the blinds and let the filtered daylight do its slow, steady work.",
