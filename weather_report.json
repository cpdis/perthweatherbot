    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a quiet, cloudless pre-dawn, the air a touch crisp and clean enough to hear your own footsteps. Stars are loosening their grip on the sky and the first pale tint of morning is gathering in the east, promising a clear, uncomplicated start.\n\nExpect a bright, sunny day with excellent visibility and that early-spring clarity that sharpens edges and moods alike. UV will climb quickly once the sun is up, edging into the moderate-to-high range by late morning, so bring sunglasses, a hat, and a dab of sunscreen. Dress in light layers: a soft jumper now, easy to shed for a mild, sunlit afternoon. It\u2019s good weather for ordinary pleasures\u2014an unhurried walk for a takeaway coffee, hanging a fresh wash to dry, cycling a short errand, or tending a pot on the balcony before work. Around lunch, find a patch of shade to read or simply sit and watch the day shine.",
