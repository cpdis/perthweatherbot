    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls gently over Downtown San Francisco, the cityscape lies shrouded in a muted embrace, with clouds swirling and wrestling against a hint of moisture in the air. The temperature hovers in that cool and crisp realm, just around 50 degrees, suggesting a need for layers. A light wind whispers through the streets, a soft reminder of the day ahead, promising to stir the coastal fog that may linger like a silent specter in the hills.\n\nToday, the forecast predicts rain\u2014likely to greet us more appreciably as the hours wane on a day that will tread steadily from mildness into the chill of afternoon. With the promise of precipitation unfurling around 60%, it beckons the curious wanderer to prepare, ideally swathed in a waterproof layer and sturdy shoes, perhaps even an umbrella, just in case. This weather invites contemplative indoor pursuits; a leisurely visit to a nearby museum, where the warmth of knowledge and creativity can offset the damp chill, or perhaps a stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 where the smell of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the scent of convenience and the stirrings of conversation. The morning air may feel brisk and sharp, but as the rain begins to fall softly, it invites one to linger longer within the comforting confines of the city.",
