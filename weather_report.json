Visibility is reduced, giving the landscape a dreamlike quality, with familiar outlines obscured, leaving the viewer with a sense of intrigue. The clouds above promise a transformation, as the morning sun strives to break through, hinting at clear skies ahead. \n\nFor those venturing out today, the morning's haze will begin to lift by mid-morning, giving way to a day that balances sun and cloud, reaching a pleasant high near 59. A light north wind carries with it a chill that lingers, inviting layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater paired with a light jacket for warmth against the crisp air. As the day unfolds and the fog recedes, consider a tranquil walk along the waterfront or a visit to one of the city\u2019s inviting caf\u00e9s. Seek pockets of sunlight, where the warmth contrasts beautifully with the cool breeze, and indulge in the simple pleasure of people-watching as locals and visitors alike embrace the vibrant pulse of the city on this serene December day.",
