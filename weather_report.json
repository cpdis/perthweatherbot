    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, an ethereal haze blankets the city, teasing with the promise of moisture. Tonight, gentle rain paints the landscape before dawn, a soft drumming that lulls you into an embrace with the cool air, which dips to a crisp 53 degrees. The clouds weave a shroud over the skyline, with gusty westerly winds contributing a lively rustle to the branches lining the streets. The potential for drizzle hovers around the evening's edge, offering a delicate touch of nature as the city winds down for the night.\n\nTomorrow beckons with the possibility of a new day bathed in mostly sunny brilliance, yet the morning may still bear the remnants of drizzle, hinting at the summer-like warmth that often dances in this coastal city. Highs near 62 will soon soften to a gentle 60 as the afternoon unfolds, with breezes fading to a cool whisper, just enough to stir the last leaves of autumn. For those venturing outside, layering will be your ally\u2014a light jacket for the evening chill, perhaps paired with a scarf to fend off the late-hour dampness, giving you the perfect balance of comfort and style. A stroll along the Embarcadero, a quiet corner caf\u00e9 with a warm drink awaiting, or perhaps a visit to the local bookstore might be the remedy for a cozy evening in this urban oasis, grounding you in the magic of a San Francisco night.",
