    "weather_report": "As the night embraces Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil clarity wraps the city in its gentle arms, with a cool whisper of wind meandering through the avenues. The current temperature lies comfortably low, instilling a sense of calm that promises sweet dreams beneath a clear starlit sky. Without the usual fog that often weaves itself through the San Francisco nights, the city glows softly in the distance, offering hints of warmth amidst the coolness.\n\nTomorrow dawns sunny, heralding a day where the sun will rise, casting a luminous glow over the landscape. As temperatures climb yet remain pleasantly mild, the city will present itself in a parade of golden light, perfect for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quaint adventures through the bustling neighborhoods. Dressing in layers will be wise; a light jacket may be needed to ward off the bite of the morning chill, yet a comfortable shirt will suffice as the sun graces the skyline. Perhaps a quiet afternoon spent enjoying a book at a caf\u00e9 or meandering through the charming streets will offer the ideal complement to this cheerful winter day, reminding all who linger just how enchanting the city's charms can be, even in the cooler months.",
