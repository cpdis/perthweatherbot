    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over downtown San Francisco, the city emerges into a world softened by gentle clarity and coolness. With a sunny promise hovering around sixty degrees, the day begins unencumbered by fog, though whispers of a marine layer linger just beyond the Bay, nearly hidden from view but felt in the cool caress of the air. A low wind nudges through the streets, bringing to mind the last remnants of fog that tend to retreat as the sun climbs higher. Today's canvas is painted in blues and whites, an invitation to experience the city with open arms and a light heart.\n\nAs the afternoon wears on, temperatures will dip slightly, a subtle reminder of the coastal influence. Attire should lean toward layers; perhaps a light sweater or a long-sleeved shirt to comfortably embrace the afternoon breeze. With such inviting weather, one might find joy in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the gentle lapping of the waves can be heard against the piers, or perhaps a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9 for a warm drink while watching as the city stirs to life with its usual vibrancy. As the evening approaches, clouds will begin to gather, but for now, the warmth of the sun beckons you to savor the beauty of a San Francisco day before the chill of night settles in.",
