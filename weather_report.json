    "weather_report": "The night in Downtown San Francisco brings with it a palpable sense of stillness, washed over by the gentle but persistent patter of rain that will linger throughout the coming hours. Muffled sounds of the city blend with the rhythmic whispers of raindrops, enveloping the streets in a soft embrace, while the temperature treads closely to the cool end of the spectrum. Beneath a canopy of thick cloud cover, visibility takes on an elusive quality, the kind that shrouds landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge in mystery, their outlines softened and blurred.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the rain will intensify, commanding its full presence with a 100% chance of precipitation\u2014a day ripe for introspection and quietude rather than vibrant outings. Those venturing outside may find themselves drawn to a steaming cup of coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9, the warmth of the mug contrasting with the crispness of the air. Layering up is wise; consider donning a waterproof jacket, perhaps even indulging in a sturdy umbrella that echoes the day's commitment to rain. The marine layer, ever the fickle friend of San Francisco's weather, dances just beyond the skyline, stealing visibility and muting the palette of colors found in the city. For those at home, it might be an ideal time to curl up with a good book or catch up on favorite series, letting the rain's song wash over familiar spaces.",
