    "weather_report": "Subiaco sits in the small hours beneath a clean, untroubled sky, the kind that makes the streetlights feel a little farther apart. It is calm and cool, with the stars sharp and undimmed; UV is essentially absent now, and sunrise should bring an easy, unfiltered light. Forecasts through the pre-dawn remain clear, and if this tenor holds, the morning will open bright with excellent clarity and a pleasant, honest kind of sunshine that invites you outside without fuss.\n\nDress for a gentle chill before dawn\u2014light layers, a soft jumper or cardigan\u2014and be ready to shed to a tee once the sun takes hold; pack sunglasses and a dab of sunscreen, as UV will climb quickly after sunrise on a clear day. At this hour, a quiet stroll or a slow cup on the balcony suits the mood; early risers might try a brisk walk to beat the day\u2019s hum, water the plants, or cycle the first errand while the roads are still polite. As the day gathers, errands and desk work near a window feel right, with a mid-morning break in the sun to keep the spirit tidy.",
