    "weather_report": "Subiaco settles under a spotless evening sky, the sort of clean, untroubled blue that makes the town feel larger and quieter at once. The afternoon held to clear, honest sunshine; with the sun riding low at this time of year, light was bright but gentle and the UV stayed modest, then fell away quickly toward dusk. Now, with night fully arrived, the air feels composed and still, and visibility is crisp right down the streets.\n\nThe forecast keeps it clear through late evening and into the small hours, a pleasant, unhurried stretch of weather. It looks like a night for calm routines: a short stroll to air out the day, a phone call from a balcony, or finishing that lingering chore while the sky keeps you company. Dress in layers with a warm coat; a scarf will make lingering outdoors more comfortable. With UV essentially gone, it\u2019s a safe time to wander without worry, and to let the clarity of the night do the simple work of clearing the mind.",
