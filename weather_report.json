    "weather_report": "Evening in Subiaco arrives with a lidded sky and the soft hush that follows a day slipping out the back door. Any bite of sunshine is long gone, the UV all but extinguished, and the streetlights do the heavy lifting under a quilt of cloud. Expect the night to carry a brush of light rain before settling into a steady, overcast mood; visibility is muted, edges are softer, colors drained to pewter and slate. It\u2019s not harsh, just quietly damp and a touch introspective.\n\nDress for a cool, grey amble: a light waterproof or trench, closed shoes, and a small umbrella if you\u2019re stepping out. It\u2019s a good night for errands with a purpose\u2014the kind you finish in twenty minutes\u2014then home to clear the kitchen counter, set out tomorrow\u2019s coffee, or finally answer that letter you\u2019ve been meaning to write. If you crave fresh air, take a short loop under awnings and tree canopies and let the drizzle stitch a gentle metronome to your thoughts.",
