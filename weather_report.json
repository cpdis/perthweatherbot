As the morning stretches awake, expect sunshine to dominate, then a drift of scattered cloud by mid-morning\u2014enough to add texture without dimming the day\u2019s brightness. The light will be crisp and clear, and the UV, typical for a spring morning here, will ramp up quickly once the sun lifts; plan for sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses even if the breeze feels mild.\n\nIt looks like a pleasant day for light layers: a soft tee or linen shirt with something you can shrug off by late morning. Step out for an unhurried coffee walk while the sun is low, water the balcony plants, or run a short errand by bike before the glare sharpens. Later, a shaded table and a book will suit the brightness, or a tidy-up of the garden between patches of cloud, leaving the rest of the day to idle comfortably.",
