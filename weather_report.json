    "weather_report": "Just past midnight in Subiaco, the sky is a patchwork\u2014broken cloud drifting like torn linen, then parting now and then to let a cool moonlight breathe across the quiet streets. It feels calm and a touch brisk, the kind of night that asks for a light layer and unhurried steps. Through the small hours the cover should thin toward scattered cloud, leaving the early morning softer and a little clearer.\n\nBy daylight, expect a gentle, filtered brightness rather than a full-bore blue\u2014sun pressing through veils of cloud with modest warmth. The UV is negligible overnight, then low in the morning, likely edging to a mild midday sting typical of late winter; not fierce, but worth a hat and a faint brush of sunscreen if you linger outside. Dress in layers: a soft jumper or light jacket for dawn, something you can peel back if the sun gains confidence. It looks like a pleasant, low-drama day\u2014good for a quiet walk to the park when the birds get chatty, watering the balcony plants, or a lingering coffee by a window while the light improves. If you\u2019re up late, make tea and let the night taper; if you\u2019re up early, a short errand loop or a gentle ride will feel clean and easy under a sky that\u2019s finding its clarity.",
