    "weather_report": "In the tranquil embrace of early dawn, Subiaco rests beneath a pristine celestial expanse. The sky stretches vast and unblemished, casting an almost ethereal quality over the sleeping suburb, with no trace of clouds to clutter its vast, cerulean canvas. The air feels crisp yet gentle, wrapping around the world like a silk veil that\u2019s kissed by the promise of a radiant day ahead. With the sun yet to crest the horizon, this is a moment frozen in quiet anticipation, an interlude where the dreamscape lingers before the full vibrancy of day takes hold.\n\nToday promises an uninterrupted golden glow that those basking beneath it might describe as positively delightful\u2014a sunlit serenade that dances down to earth, inviting you to engage with your surroundings in earnest. As you ponder the delights of the day, the clarity from this morning will extend into the afternoon, offering you a day of rare beauty, unmarred by the gloom of clouds or haze. Dress lightly, comfortably; cotton and linen are your allies in savoring the warmth without burden. Shielding sunglasses and a trusty sun hat shall serve as your fortification against the sun's passion, and perhaps, a leisurely excursion would be fitting. Meander through the local park, where dappled sunlight filters through leaves, or indulge in a market wander, the scents and colors harmonizing with the azure skies above. Subiaco in August is shining brightly and warmly, an inviting tableau inviting you to step out and indulge in its serenely stunning day.",
