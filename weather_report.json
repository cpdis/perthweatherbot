    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfurls under a bright, sunny sky, presenting a serene canvas of azure peppered with faint wisps of clouds. The vividness of the day invites exploration, yet as afternoon approaches, a gentle cooling will sweep through, heralding a drop in temperature. The winds whisper softly from the north, carrying with them the crisp fragrance of the sea, ensuring that while the sun shines brightly, the coolness of the air reminds us this is a city perched at the edge of the Pacific.\n\nDress simply yet warmly\u2014a light sweater or jacket will suffice, as evening descends swiftly with its promise of clarity and a comforting chill. It\u2019s a day encouraging quiet strolls along the waterfront, perhaps a leisurely coffee at one of the local caf\u00e9s where the sun's rays filter through soft, rustling leaves. As twilight approaches, consider a gentle hike in the nearby hills, embracing the fading warmth while the stars begin to punctuate the evening sky.",
