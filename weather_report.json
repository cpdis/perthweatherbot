    "weather_report": "Los Angeles wakes under a quiet pre-dawn, the sky a deep blue canvas with scattered clouds drifting like unhurried thoughts. Yesterday afternoon held the same pattern, and today looks set to reprise it: a mostly sunny day punctuated by passing cloud cover, leaving light and shadow to trade places across the streets. UV is low now and will stay gentle in the early hours, rising to moderate by midday despite the winter sun\u2019s softer angle, so sunglasses and a touch of sunscreen won\u2019t be out of place. Visibility should be clean and bright once the sun is up, with that cool morning clarity that makes colors feel honest.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for light layers: a soft sweater or a thin jacket for the chill at daybreak, peeled back to a comfortable shirt by late morning. Let it be an unhurried day\u2014an early walk for coffee, a grocery run before the traffic stirs, a midmorning read on a balcony or a quiet bench, and a simple errand loop while the sun winks through the clouds. If you\u2019re commuting, it should feel pleasant door to door; if you\u2019re staying close to home, open a window and let the air move through.",
