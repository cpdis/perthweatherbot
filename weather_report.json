    "weather_report": "In the early hours, the chill lingers gently in the air as the sun has yet to extend its warm embrace over Downtown San Francisco. The sky, adorned with a few scattered clouds, hints at a promise of clarity to come. As the morning unfolds, expect the sun to break free from its slumber, casting a soft glow across a city that awakens with anticipation. Temperatures are destined to rise gradually, settling in the low sixties but slipping back slightly as the day wears on. The breeze, a tender whisper from the north-northeast, brushes lightly against your skin, just enough to remind you of the coolness still lurking in the air.\n\nGiven this tranquil but crisp start, consider dressing in layers\u2014a light sweater or a cozy jacket to fend off the remaining chill of the morning, coupled with comfortable pants for the day's leisurely excursions. The absence of fog allows for clearer views across the bay, beckoning you to explore the outdoors. A stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the city\u2019s quiet parks could be the perfect way to savor the day. Alternatively, an afternoon coffee at a sunlit caf\u00e9 might offer a moment of relaxation, watching the world pass by as the sun climbs higher. This day, while serene and fresh, invites gentle exploration and peaceful reflection.",
