    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a clear, generous sky, the morning already bright enough to sharpen colors and coax shadows onto the pavement. The air feels clean and uncomplicated, the sort that makes everything seem freshly washed. Sunshine will be abundant and unwavering today; as the sun climbs, the UV will rise quickly from gentle to assertive, the kind that reddens skin before you\u2019ve had time to think about it.\n\nExpect a lucid, blue-skied afternoon with that crisp spring light that flatters even the most ordinary street. Dress for ease and sun: breathable layers, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a confident sweep of sunscreen; bring water if you\u2019ll be out for long. It\u2019s a good day for unhurried errands on foot, a small loop to the grocer, hanging laundry to dry, or a quiet bench in the shade with a book while the day hums by. If you\u2019re moving more, a short ride or a stroll through the trees suits the hour; just let the midday sun have the spotlight while you keep to the edges.",
