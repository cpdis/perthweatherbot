    "weather_report": "As the evening shadows deepen over Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a velvety blanket of clouds, hinting at the possibility of rain. The air carries a chill, typical for this time of year, and the dampness lingers, making it feel even cooler. With temperatures hovering around 52 degrees and winds whispering gently from the south southwest, the atmosphere has an unmistakable hint of maritime influence, suggesting that the fog might soon creep in from the bay, softening the edges of the skyline. \n\nTonight, those hoping for a dry escape might want to reconsider, as a notable 50% chance of rain could bring brief, light showers. Dressing warmly, layered with a light waterproof jacket and perhaps a scarf, will keep the dampness at bay while venturing out. It is a night conducive to quiet introspection, made for sipping hot drinks in cozy caf\u00e9s or strolling beneath the shelter of awnings as the city inches towards evening. For the adventurous, a visit to a nearby theater or a casual dinner could provide the perfect refuge from the cool, drizzly air, offering both warmth and sustenance.",
