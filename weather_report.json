    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco bathes in a gentle sunlight, casting a warm embrace on the cityscape as the day progresses. The temperatures hover around a pleasant chill of mid-fifties, providing just the right touch for those who venture outside. Currently, the air is crisp and clear, revealing the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the sprawling Downtown skyline against a backdrop of a vibrant blue sky. There is no indication of a foggy marine layer; instead, the clarity enhances the city\u2019s beauty, allowing the contours of distant hills to emerge sharply in the distance.\n\nAs evening sets in, the temperatures will dip to a cozy low of around 43, inviting you to wrap yourself in a light sweater or a smart jacket. The north wind whispers softly, urging a stroll through the quieter streets adorned with the golden hues of setting sun. Consider an easy walk along the Embarcadero, where the illuminated ferry terminal provides a stunning contrast against the winking lights of the Bay as night approaches. The cool air and picturesque views beckon a moment of reflection or perhaps a leisurely coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, as the city slowly shifts into an enchanting evening.",
