The skies are mostly clear, revealing a beautiful canopy of stars where the brilliance of the day's sun has retreated. The low temperature is expected to settle around a cool 52 degrees, accompanied by a gentle west wind that picks up at times, creating subtle, playful gusts. In the distance, the well-known silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge stands firm, its majesty timeless against the backdrop of a darkening sky.\n\nLooking forward to Tuesday, expect a brilliant sun to grace the city, promising a high near 66 that will taper down pleasantly during the afternoon. The breeze will be gentle, allowing for leisurely strolls down the waterfront or perhaps a casual coffee at one of the charming caf\u00e9s. As the day unfolds, dressing in layers will be wise\u2014think a light sweater over a favorite shirt, which allows you to adapt to the shifting warmth and coolness of the day. Whether wandering through the vibrant streets or simply soaking in the atmospheric beauty from a cozy spot, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to savor a moment in the heart of the city.",
