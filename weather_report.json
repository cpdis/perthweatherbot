    "weather_report": "As the warm glow of the setting sun eases into the horizon, the skies over Subiaco remain mostly clear with just a handful of clouds meandering lazily overhead. It's the kind of mellowness that translates the whisper of a quiet evening into visual poetry, suggesting a day that is at ease with itself. True, the sun\u2019s rays are gentle at this hour, their intensity fading gracefully, signaling a dip in the UV index. Yet, the day cloaks itself in an inviting clarity as it bids farewell to the daylight, opening itself up to the cool embrace of the impending night. It\u2019s neither oppressively hot nor biting cold, but instead, it promises comfort, urging one to forego heavy jackets in favor of a light sweater, a beloved scarf perhaps draped loosely as a nod to the evening's impending chill.\n\nThis quiet elegance in weather offers the perfect backdrop for simple pleasures and understated moments. A relaxed stroll through a neighborhood park seems all the more appealing, as the night serenades the soul with the soft rustle of leaves and the lullaby of distant urban life. Or perhaps, sitting on a verandah with a lukewarm cup of chamomile and a book that deserves your attention, but you find your eyes gazing at the horizon more than the pages would be more fitting. As the remaining daylight gradually sinks behind the gentle outlines of the landscape, one embraces the tranquility of now, feeling the day's rhythm gradually slow its cadence to match the stillness that the night promises.",
