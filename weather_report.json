    "weather_report": "Morning drifts in under a soft grey lid at Emu Point, the sea flattened to pewter and the horizon a smudge. Light rain is due to arrive toward late morning and return early afternoon, with only brief, pale hints of sun in between. The day looks muted rather than bright; visibility will be a touch hazy along the water and colors subdued, though the air feels pleasantly cool. UV won\u2019t roar today but it will nudge up around midday despite the cloud, so treat it as moderate at best: not a burner, yet not nothing.\n\nDress in light layers with a waterproof top, shoes that don\u2019t mind wet pavement, and keep a compact umbrella close. It\u2019s a good day for unhurried errands, a quiet coffee by a window, or a short promenade along the path when the showers back off; save the longer beach linger for another day. If you\u2019re out on the headland, watch the slick boards and let the breeze do the talking; if you\u2019re staying in, open a window and let the weather edit the soundtrack of your morning.",
