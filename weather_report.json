    "weather_report": "Evening settles over Subiaco with a quiet sky: mostly clear, a few tufts of cloud drifting without urgency. The late afternoon offered thin, broken cloud and moments of gentle sun, but now the light has slipped away and the UV sits effectively at zero. Through the next few hours, expect a calm, largely dry night with scattered cloud at times and otherwise decent clarity\u2014enough for the brighter stars to make an appearance between passing veils.\n\nIt feels like a night for easy comforts rather than bravado. A light layer or cardigan will suit the mild coolness; nothing too heavy unless you feel the chill quickly. Consider a slow stroll after dinner, a small loop to fetch milk or return a library book, or simply sit by an open window and let the faint night air tidy the edges of your day. If you\u2019re staying in, a tidy-up of the desk or a quiet chapter of a book will fit the unhurried weather.",
