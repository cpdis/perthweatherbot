    "weather_report": "As twilight descends on Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a tender veil of rain, the droplets softly tapping against windowpanes as they interlace with the cool air. The temperature lingers around a crisp 52 degrees, gently rising like the promises of a nighttime tale. The clouds, thick with moisture, shroud the skyline, compelling the Golden Gate Bridge to dissolve into a muted silhouette, lost in the hazy romance of the evening. A brisk southwestern wind whispers through the streets, swirling the scent of wet pavement and mossy hills, hinting at the atmospheric change that gathers overhead. \n\nTomorrow greets us with the prospect of rain lingering throughout the day, lightening at moments to reveal fleeting glimpses of sun that may tease the city. A cool high of 58 degrees beckons warmth, suggesting layers\u2014a cozy sweater, perhaps, or a stylish rain jacket. The 70% chance of precipitation dances in the air, carrying the promise of a light drizzle rather than a deluge. For those inclined to venture, consider a quiet afternoon stroll beneath an umbrella, relishing the glistening streets, or perhaps artfully navigating the tender fog that rolls in, wrapping like a soft scarf around the city\u2019s renowned sites. Embrace the calm of this rainy day, whether curled up with a book in a caf\u00e9 or wandering the spacious art galleries where the gray outside gives way to vibrant colors within.",
