    "weather_report": "Subiaco wakes under a rinsed-blue sky, the sun already brightening verandas and jarrah leaves. The morning feels dry and clear, edges crisp, with hardly a wisp to trouble the horizon. Expect the day to stay steadfastly sunny through early afternoon and likely beyond, the light clean and almost glassy. UV will rise quickly and sit very high around midday, the kind that carries a sting even in brief moments; heat builds steadily from mild to warmly insistent, tempered later by an obliging breeze.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for light, breathable clothes, a broad hat and dark lenses, sunscreen as habit, and water within reach. If you\u2019ve errands, enjoy them before lunch while the sun still feels companionable; let fresh sheets take the open air on the line; give the balcony pots a drink and a little shade. A quiet coffee in a courtyard, a meander through Kings Park\u2019s paths, or a library visit when the light sharpens would suit the mood. As the afternoon breeze stirs, an unhurried walk along Rokeby Road feels right, basking in the day\u2019s glow without wrestling it.",
