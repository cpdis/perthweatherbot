    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries an unmistakable chill, punctuated by the likelihood of drizzle throughout the day. A thick blanket of clouds shrouds the city, obscuring the sun's lingering warmth and casting a muted gray over the skyline. As the day unfolds, temperatures are expected to hover merely in the high fifties, with a subtle drop in the afternoon that might make you reach for a cozy sweater. Wind will dance lightly from the south, occasionally picking up with gusts that whip through the streets, adding to that crispness in the air.\n\nAs night approaches, the drizzle may give way to more persistent rain, falling gently on the pavement and accentuating the sounds of the city as you meander past shops or linger in a caf\u00e9. The fog hugs the hills, weaving its misty way around the Golden Gate and creeping through the avenues, rendering the landmarks more ethereal than concrete. Given these conditions, it might be wise to dress in layers, donning a light waterproof jacket and perhaps a scarf to stave off the dampness. As you plan your day, consider a stroll through your neighborhood, indulging in the intimacy of a local bookstore or enjoying the warmth of indoor festivities, perhaps a small concert or artistic showcase where the ambiance can match the mood of brews and conversation.",
