    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the day ushers in a serene clarity, with the sun's gentle rays illuminating the cityscape against a canvas of blue. The air is crisp, the anticipated high settling near fifty-four degrees, the warmth gradually retreating to a cool fifty-two as the afternoon draws closer. A soft southeast wind whispers through the streets, barely a breath but sufficient to carry the scent of salt and sea. Tonight brings a subtle shift, with clouds rolling in, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle after four. The nighttime low will rest around forty-two, rising gradually as if to ease the chill.\n\nThe morning offers an invitation to adventure, a perfect time for a leisurely stroll through the flower-laden streets of Golden Gate Park, perhaps stopping to admire the rising blooms. Alternatively, the nearby caf\u00e9s beckon for a warm cup of coffee or tea, ideal for savoring while surveying the bustling city life. As the sun dips lower, be prepared for the layer of marine fog to creep quietly back across the bay, a reminder of the unique character of this coastal city. Layering up with a light jacket is wise; it will keep you cozy against the evening's approach.",
