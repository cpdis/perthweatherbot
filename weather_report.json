    "weather_report": "As the darkness of the early morning settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle rain begins to mingle with the cool air, creating an atmosphere thick with the scent of damp earth. The clouds hang low, promising an evening where visibility is limited and the city's vibrant lights shimmer through a veil of moisture. The forecast hints at a chilly outing ahead, with temperatures hovering just above fifty; the kind of night that calls for a cozy sweater layered beneath a water-resistant jacket. \n\nThursday is set to unfold under a stubborn blanket of clouds, with rain continuing its steady rhythm. As the day progresses, the temperature will dip slightly, lending that invigorating chill that makes hot coffee feel all the more comforting. With the chance of rain at an impressive eighty percent, prudence suggests considering indoor pursuits: a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9 or an art gallery might provide a delightful shelter from the persistent drizzle. Should you be so inclined, a stroll along the waterfront may invigorate the soul, though one might want to don waterproof footwear to sidestep the wet pavements. As San Francisco weather is prone to atmospheric shifts, a casual exploration of what the city offers\u2014perhaps a locally cherished bookstore or an intimate theater\u2014could reveal hidden gems amid the relentless rain.",
