The sunlight will illuminate the city\u2019s iconic landmarks, reflecting off buildings and enhancing the vibrant energy that defines the streets. While there may be fleeting spells of fog nearby, the city itself will likely remain clear\u2014a delightful contrast to the typically fog-cloaked mornings of winter. Such conditions beckon residents to enjoy a casual day\u2014perhaps a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink, or an afternoon ramble through the historic alleys, soaking in the ambiance as life unfolds at a gentle pace.",
