    "weather_report": "Tonight, the air hangs heavy with the promise of rain, the clouds cloaking the city in a soft gray embrace, hinting at the quiet murmurs of a storm that will likely break before dawn. As the temperature hovers around a cool 43, the heightened humidity whispers through the streets, granting a slight chill, yet a subtle warmth will encroach as the night unfolds. The east-southeast wind, mild and unhurried, carries with it the scent of wet earth, a reminder that change is inevitable and refreshing.\n\nAs Wednesday dawns, the city will awaken to those inevitable showers, the kind that dance lightly against rooftops before modestly relenting into brief moments of sunlight. The high near 55 will gradually descend, casting a compelling contrast between the coolness of late winter and the lingering warmth of expectation. With a 70% chance of rain, the day feels both vibrant and subdued, a perfect backdrop for quiet, unassuming pursuits. One might consider strolling through the Embarcadero, where the ocean mist mingles with the scent of warm baked goods from street vendors\u2014an ideal pairing. Dressing in layers would be wise, embracing a comfortable coat to ward off the chill and a sturdy umbrella, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary through the lens of a gray, moody day.",
