    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past three in the afternoon, Downtown San Francisco embraces a day both hushed and expectant, draped in the kind of chill that teases the senses. The forecast hints at rain that has yet to materialize, leaving a crispness in the air, punctuated by a gusty breeze from the west-northwest. While the clouds above billow, their gray faces hold the promise of a brief but lively shower; a 90% chance of precipitation hangs like a thick curtain. Yet, for now, the city maintains a hesitant clarity, filtered through a thin layer of moisture that softens the usual sharpness of its skyline.\n\nAs evening approaches, the allure of the outdoors beckons\u2014ideal for those who appreciate a brisk walk wrapped in layers. The golden hues of the post-rain sun are yet to emerge, leaving the streets cool and inviting for a leisurely stroll or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9. The breeze will whisper through light jackets and perhaps a scarf, keeping warmth close as temperatures dip into the evening. With the city wearing its subdued palette and moments of brilliance teasing the horizon, the day holds itself in a gentle balance\u2014one perfect for savoring the mysteries of the San Francisco twilight.",
