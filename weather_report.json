The sky above is mostly clear, yet hints of the iconic fog show themselves across the horizon, just skirting the Golden Gate, suggesting the ever-present marine influence. With today\u2019s high hovering around 54 degrees, the brisk fresh air invites a cozy attire\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a jacket for the morning\u2019s cool embrace. \n\nAs the sun climbs higher, temperatures will modestly dip and then hold steady, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks. This time of year, with the fleeting daylight, serves as a charming backdrop for a cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where one might savor the warm drink while people-watching. By evening, the air will cool further, crafting a tranquil setting, perfect for a late walk beneath a sky that gradually gives way to starry skies, punctuated by the fading hues of sunset.",
