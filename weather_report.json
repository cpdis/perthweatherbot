    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a heavy canopy of grey clouds, with rain steadily falling. The chill in the air tugs at the edges of one\u2019s warmth, as temperatures hover close to the mid-fifties. Gusting winds from the south add a brisk bite to the atmosphere, making the prospect of stepping outside feel less inviting. Visibility is compromised, shrouded in misty tendrils that hint at the marine layer lurking just beyond the city\u2019s edges, while the iconic silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and downtown skyscrapers fade in and out of view. Those with plans to wander might reconsider; a cozy afternoon indoors beckons.\n\nAs night approaches, the rain is set to intensify, wrapping the city in a soft, drenching embrace. With temperatures expected to rise slightly, the air will remain thick with moisture. For those daring to venture out, a well-worn raincoat and sturdy shoes will serve as essential armor against the elements. Perhaps a warm beverage at a local caf\u00e9 or a quiet evening curled up with a book will be the preferred sanctuary for the urban inhabitant, making the most of this placid, albeit damp, winter\u2019s day.",
