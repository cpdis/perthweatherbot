    "weather_report": "Before dawn in Subiaco, the sky is clean and untroubled, a deep blue softening toward the first gold at the edges. It feels calm and promising, the sort of early hour when sounds carry and the air is cool on the skin. As the sun clears the rooftops, expect a bright, unhindered day with hard, clear light and long, crisp views; the UV will rise quickly and bite by late morning despite the inviting sky. It looks pleasant now and a touch unforgiving later.\n\nDress for a gentle start that turns sharp: light layers you can shed, breathable fabrics, a brimmed hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen you don\u2019t forget to reapply. This is a morning for small, ordinary pleasures\u2014an unhurried walk to pick up bread, a quiet lap of the oval, putting a load of washing on the line before the heat takes over. Commute or run errands early; save jobs that like shade for the afternoon, and keep water within reach when the sun is at full voice.",
