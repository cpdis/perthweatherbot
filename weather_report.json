    "weather_report": "As evening falls over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crispness that invigorates the senses. The forecast hints at a lively night with the temperature dipping to a mild 45 degrees, a typical embrace of the city's cool climate. The bracing north wind casts gentle gusts that dance through the streets, while the sky remains mostly clear \u2013 a welcome reprieve from the fog that often cloaks this beloved city. \n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, a mix of partly sunny skies is anticipated, with temperatures hovering near the brisk heights of 58 before settling into the softness of 55 by afternoon. Though you might notice a haze lingering along the coast, obscuring the Golden Gate Bridge in a bittersweet embrace, the day promises warmth tempered by the cool sea breeze, perfect for layering. Pull on your favorite cardigan over a light shirt, and consider sturdy shoes for a stroll through the bustling streets, perhaps stopping by a quiet caf\u00e9 for a warm drink. While grand plans might be postponed by the cooling trend, a simple exploration of local galleries or a leisurely bookstore visit can reveal the charm and creativity that pulse through this iconic city, inviting you to rediscover its treasures anew.",
