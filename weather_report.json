    "weather_report": "Perth sits under a brilliant, unblemished sky at midday, the sun clean and insistent, shadows crisp as paper cutouts. The air feels clear and uncomplicated, the kind that sharpens colors and turns glassy water to silver. Expect this bright, cloudless mood to hold through the afternoon and into early evening; UV will be very high now and soften only later, so a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and light, breathable layers are wise companions.\n\nIt\u2019s handsome weather, if a touch intense before the day eases. A shaded lunch on a veranda suits the hour; errands are best done with a brim and a bottle of water; laundry will dry in a blink. As the light mellows, a slow wander by the river, a quiet stop at the library, or tending to the garden with a watering can will fit the day\u2019s calm. If you stay indoors, crack a window, put on a record, and let the blue afternoon borrow its way into the room.",
